Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \"Risks Related to Our Business\" included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the distribution of avocados, guacamole products, and other perishable food products throughout the United States. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocado products, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, and prepared foods including sandwiches, salads, parfaits and ready-to-eat snack items among other products and (iii) process and package guacamole and salsa. We distribute our products both domestically and internationally.\nOn April 13, 2022, we announced plans to reorganize our business into two reporting segments, Grown and Prepared. The management transition to operate as Grown and Prepared began at the start of the third quarter of 2022. The Grown segment consists of fresh avocados, tomatoes and papayas. The Prepared segment comprises all other products including fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, ready-to-eat sandwiches, wraps, salads and snacks, guacamole, and salsa sold at retail and food service as well as avocado pulp sold to foodservice. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.\nOur Grown products business grades, sizes, packs, cools, and ripens (if desired) avocados for delivery to our customers. During fiscal 2022, we operated four packinghouses and four operating and distributing facilities (aka value-added depots or VADs) that handle avocados that are sold across the United States and to select international markets. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We believe our diversified avocado sources help provide a level of relative supply stability that may, over time, serve to increase the availability and demand for avocados among consumers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have an impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Prepared business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail and other channels. Prepared products include guacamole products (including both frozen and fresh), salsa, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. Prepared products are marketed under the Calavo, Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs. We believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Our Prepared business maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Grown and Prepared segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nSale of Investment in Limoneira\nOn October 27, 2022, we sold 1,677,299 shares of Limoneira common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $18.5 million. We used the net proceeds thereof after payment of commissions and expenses to pay down borrowings on our credit facility with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders thereto. Contemporaneously with such sale, Bank of America, as administrative agent, released its lien on such shares in accordance with terms of the Credit Facility and the related loan documents.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created challenging and unprecedented conditions for our business, and the global economy, disrupting global supply chains, changing certain purchasing norms in retail and foodservice channels and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This has resulted in inflationary and cost pressures that adversely impacted, our production and distribution costs, including costs of raw materials, packaging, labor, and freight.\nWe continue to experience increased labor costs, commodity costs and logistical costs in the current economic climate and as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing higher costs attributed to operational challenges that impact our production facilities and our logistics network; the impact of higher prices for petroleum-based products, packaging materials and other commodities; and the availability of labor.\nIn response to the inflationary costs described above, we have implemented price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future. Customers may not accept price increases or we may face competitive pressure that leads to price reductions for certain products.\nIncreasing volume of foreign grown avocados\nThe market for avocados is impacted by an increasing volume of foreign grown avocados being imported into the United States. Recently, there have been significant plantings of avocados in Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia and other parts of the world, which have had, and will continue to have, the effect of increasing the volume of foreign grown avocados entering the United States market.\nDividend payment\nIn November 2022, we announced that we will begin declaring and paying dividends quarterly rather than annually as had been our practice. On December 14, 2022, we paid a dividend of $0.2875 per share, or an aggregate of $5.2 million, to shareholders of record on November 16, 2022.\nProject Uno\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company launched Project Uno, a strategic set of initiatives that seeks to identify areas of operating efficiencies and cost savings to expand profit margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. We have undertaken multiple productivity and transformation initiatives, including (1) closure of the Prepared Florida plant\nand transfer of its viable operations into Prepared Georgia, (2) implementing broader supply chain operational improvements, (3) integrating our commercial, logistics, IT, procurement and accounting functions across the three divisions, (4) product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow moving stock keeping units and (5) outsourcing certain functions in our North American business to third-party service providers and the associated implementation of new procurement technology solutions.\nAs Project Uno has progressed, we have embedded operating controls and initiatives outlined by Project Uno into our regular operating procedures. As such, we anticipate the financial impact of Project Uno will simply be embedded in our financial results of operations as opposed to separately disclosed.\nMexico tax audits\nIn January 2017, we received preliminary observations from the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria in Mexico (the SAT\u201d) related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nOn February 4, 2022, we had a follow-up meeting with the SAT in Mexico City to begin a dialog with the objective of reaching a settlement of the 2013 Assessment. The SAT agreed in principle to continue this dialog, but requested that we provide a financial guaranty to secure the related tax as a pre-requisite to these discussions.\nOn February 25, 2022, we filed an injunction to challenge the SAT's response issued to the Reconsideration. This would allow time to continue the discussions with SAT at the administrative level and would give SAT the legal basis to issue a new resolution. This injunction suit represents a further opportunity for a Court of Law to analyze this matter from a constitutional perspective.\nThe injunction suit was admitted for analysis by the District Court, however, SAT filed a complaint (queja) against the ruling allowing Calavo de Mexico ( CDM\u201d) to file an extension of the injunction suit. This complaint was filed by SAT to challenge the admission and analysis of the injunction suit; this complaint was decided by the Circuit Courts in October 2022 against the SAT complaint and the Court will start the analysis of injunction in the following months.\nOn March 4, 2022, the Annulment Suit was formally accepted by the Federal Tax Court, which simultaneously granted a provisional suspension of the collections proceedings by the SAT. The acceptance by the court of the Annulment Suit renders the 2013 Assessment as non-definitive, until such time as the suit is resolved.\nOn March 10, 2022, we met with the SAT and offered an Administrative Guaranty (Embargo en Via Administrativa) to secure the 2013 Assessment, which provides the SAT with certain administrative rights to CDM assets in the unlikely event we do not prevail in our actions through the Federal Tax Court (see below). Once the Administrative Guaranty is in place, the existing liens over the assets of CDM will be removed and the SAT collection process will be suspended.\nOn April 27, 2022, the SAT provided a Positive Compliance Opinion to CDM, and consequently the Tax Authority renewed the VAT Certification to CDM. These two resolutions signal a positive development on the Tax controversies in Mexico.\nOn October 10, 2022, the Tax Court ruled in favor of CDM granting the definitive suspension, accepting the Administrative Guaranty and forcing the SAT to remove all liens placed on CDM fixed assets and bank accounts. The Court also recognized that the $3.1 billion pesos assessment exceeds the economic capacity of CDM.\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million USD\nin the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October 31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable\nHistorically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, the tax authorities began objecting to refund requests and supporting documentation that had previously been deemed acceptable to process a refund. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nIn April 2022, the Tax Court issued the ruling for the months of July, August and September 2015 through which it was declared that the following resolutions were resolved:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>It is recognized that CDM operates as a maquila under the authorization of the Ministry of Finance. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>It is recognized that all bank deposits corresponding to the purchase of avocados on behalf of Calavo Growers Inc. (CGI), are subject to the maquila program and it is not accruable income for purposes of Income Tax nor activities subject to VAT. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>It is recognized that VAT is recoverable, since CDM demonstrated the existence of operations carried under the maquila services. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Resolved that certain VAT amounts attributed to the purchase of certain packing materials are not recoverable as CDM was not the buyer on record and therefore did not pay for the materials, which approximated $6.9 million pesos (approximately $0.3 million USD). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe court is still reviewing the appeal filed by the Company on May 9, 2022, against the ruling resolving that certain VAT amounts are not recoverable.\nThe latest court resolution sustains the Company's position that it is entitled to substantially all of its VAT amounts, and the Company is considering its options for collecting the entire VAT receivable. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented, and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, as of October 31, 2022, CDM has filed Administrative Appeals for months for which IVA refunds have been denied by the SAT, and will continue filing such appeals for any months for which refunds are denied in the future. Therefore, it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, IVA tax receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on volume purchased and our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $0.1 million.\n2013 Mexican Tax Audit Assessment. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nAs a result, in July 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment totaling approximately $2.6 billion Mexican pesos (which includes annual adjustments for inflation, and equals approximately $131.3 million USD at October 31, 2022) related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and value added tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. This amount has been adjusted for inflation as of October 31, 2022 to the amount of $3 billion Mexican pesos (approximately $151.5 million USD). Additionally, the tax authorities have determined that we owe our employee's profit-sharing liability, totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos (approximately $6.0 million USD at October 31, 2022).\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October\n31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable. As of October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2021, CDM IVA receivables totaled $43.6 million (865.4 million Mexican pesos) and $37.5 million (762.1 million Mexican pesos). Historically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, however, the tax authorities began carrying out more detailed reviews of our refund requests and our supporting documentation. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the tax authorities informed us that their internal opinion, based on the information provided by the local SAT office, considers that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure and therefore CDM cannot claim the refundable IVA balance. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. CDM started an Administrative Appeal for the IVA related to the request of the months of July, August and September of 2015 (the 2015 Appeal\u201d) in order to assert its argument that CDM is properly documented and to therefore change the SAT's internal assessment. In August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan on the 2015 Appeal indicating that they believe CDM's legal interpretation of its declared tax structure is indeed accurate. While favorable on this central matter of CDM's declared tax structure, the ruling, however, still does not recognize the taxpayers right to a full refund for the IVA related to the months of July, August and September 2015. Therefore, in October 2018, CDM filed a substance-over-form Annulment Suit in the Federal Tax Court to recover its full refund for IVA over the subject period, which is currently pending resolution.\nIn spite of the favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan, as discussed above, the local SAT office has denied our refund claims and continues to believe that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure. As a result, they believe CDM cannot claim certain refundable IVA balances, specifically regarding our IVA refunds since January through October 2017. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, CDM has filed an Administrative Appeals for the IVA related to the preceding months. A response to these Administrative Appeals is currently pending resolution.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Company is currently considering its options for resolution of the VAT receivables. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years. This estimated time could be impacted and delayed by the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. Therefore, we believe that it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts. However, there is no assurance that we will collect the full amount reflected in our financial statements.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's allocated goodwill exceeds the unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.\nAs a result of the Company's operating segment realignment, the composition of its reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment was changed. RFG reporting unit goodwill is now included within the Prepared reporting unit. Therefore, goodwill of $24.7 million, which was previously recorded within the RFG reporting unit, is now within our Prepared segment and $4.0 million, previously recorded within the Fresh reporting unit, is now in our Grown segment. Prior to the change in its reporting unit, the Company tested goodwill for impairment at the previous reporting unit, which did not result in any impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company's estimated fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value in our quantitative assessment of the Company's impairment test. The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow methodology. To corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis, a market approach is utilized using observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded. The Company concluded based on quantitative assessment tests that no goodwill impairment existed in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units which includes forecasted cash flow. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses related to Mexican tax matters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and charges related to RFG Florida facility closure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of Temecula packinghouse\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recovery (loss) on reserve for FreshRealm note receivable and impairment of investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (3.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized and realized net loss (gain) on Limoneira shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe below tables include non-GAAP measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\u201d\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) interest income and expense, (2) income taxes (benefit) provision, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA with further adjustments for (1) non-cash net losses (income) recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted EBITDA is a primary metric by which management evaluates the operating performance of the business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to other factors, the Company's senior management is compensated. The adjustments to calculate EBITDA and adjusted\nEBITDA are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted net income and the related measure of adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables below.\nItems are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. One-time items are identified in the notes to the reconciliations in the financial tables below.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

First, U.S. avocado demand continues to grow, with per capita consumption in 2021/2022 per USDA reaching 8.4 pounds per person, and approximately 65% higher than the estimate from a decade ago. We believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the U.S. contributes to such growth, as avocados are cholesterol and sodium free, dense in fiber, vitamin B6, antioxidants, potassium, folate, and contain unsaturated fat, which helps lower cholesterol. Also, a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients, which avocados are rich in, help fight chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\nAdditionally, we believe that the demographic changes in the U.S. will impact the consumption of avocados and avocado-based products. The Hispanic community currently accounts for approximately 20% of the U.S. population and the total number of Hispanics is estimated to double by the year 2050. Avocados are considered a staple item purchased by Hispanic consumers, as the per-capita avocado consumption in Mexico is significantly higher than that of the U.S.\nWe anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the United States marketplace, driven by year-round availability of imported fresh avocados, a rapidly growing Hispanic population, and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados. As one of the largest marketers of avocado products in the United States, we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow our avocado and guacamole products business. Additionally, we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in as interest in avocados continues to expand.\nIn October 2002, the USDA announced the creation of a Hass Avocado Board to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados in the U.S. marketplace. This board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, on behalf of avocado growers, we remitted approximately $1.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million to the California Avocado Commission. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we remitted approximately $8.1 million, $8.3 million and $8.4 million to the Hass Avocado Board related to avocados. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (AFM) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (MHAIA) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (APEAM). During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we remitted approximately $4.2 million, $5.7 million and $5.2 million to APEAM primarily related to these marketing activities for Mexican avocados.\nWe also believe that our other Grown products, primarily tomatoes, are positioned for future growth. The tomato is the fourth most popular fresh-market vegetable (though a fruit scientifically speaking, tomatoes are more commonly considered a vegetable) behind potatoes, lettuce, and onions in the U.S. Although stabilizing in the first decade of the 2000s, annual average fresh-market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade. Over the past few decades, per capita consumption of tomatoes has been on the rise due primarily to the enduring popularity of salads, salad bars, and submarine sandwiches. Perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of new and improved tomato varieties, the increased development of hot-house grown tomatoes (such as those grown by our ADM affiliate), heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes, a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable-intensive diets, and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition.\nPapayas have become more popular as consumption in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past decade. Papayas have high nutritional benefits. They are rich in anti-oxidants, B vitamins, folate and pantothenic acid, potassium and magnesium, and fiber.\nAdditionally, through our Prepared segment we have expanded and accelerated the Company's presence in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce, deli, and foodservice departments. Prepared products include guacamole products (including both frozen and fresh), salsa, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches, parfaits and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. Value-added fruits and vegetables have continued to grow faster than their broader produce categories as consumers increasingly place value on the convenient nature of those products and producers to develop new formulations of value-added products. Our Prepared segment has also expanded the capacity to provide products for a larger portion of the Fresh Deli department.\nThe following tables set forth sales by product category and sales

The increase in sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year period, was due to an increase in both Grown and Prepared segments.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, the increase in Grown product sales was primarily due to an increase in price per unit of avocados offset by lower sales volume resulting from industry-wide constraints of fruit available for purchase in Mexico. For the year ended October 31, 2022, the increase in Prepared product sales was due primarily to increased per unit sales prices of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods products.\nOur Grown and Prepared segments of our business are subject to seasonal trends which can impact the volume and/or quality of raw materials sourced in any particular quarter. All intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we have begun importing avocados into the United States from our subsidiary Avocados de Jalisco. We expect this volume to increase in fiscal 2023.\nGrown Products\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021:\nNet sales for the Grown products business increased by approximately $111.7 million, or 19%, for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to prior year period. This increase in Grown product sales during the year ended October 31, 2022, was due primarily to increased sales prices of avocados associated with lower overall supply of avocados in the marketplace. In addition, tomato sales increased due to an increase in overall sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in sales prices.\nSales of avocados increased $108.1 million, or 20%, for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to the prior year period. The average avocado sales price per carton increased 37% compared to the prior year period. This increase in the sales price per carton was mainly due to a decrease of supply of avocados in the marketplace. The volume of avocados sold for the year ended October 31, 2022, decreased 12% compared to the prior year period.\nSales of tomatoes increased $3.6 million, or 8%, for the year ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year period. This increase in tomato sales was due primarily to a 9% increase in the cartons sold of tomatoes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average sales prices per carton.\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020:\nNet sales delivered by the Grown products business increased by approximately $3.5 million, or 1%, for the year ended October 31, 2021, when compared to prior year period. This increase in Grown product sales during fiscal 2021, was primarily related to increased sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales of tomatoes.\nSales of avocados increased $13.0 million, or 3%, for the year ended October 31, 2021, when compared to the prior year period. The average avocado sales price per carton increased 3% compared to the prior year period.\nSales of tomatoes decreased $10.3 million, or 19%, for the year ended October 31, 2021, when compared to the prior year period. This decrease in tomato sales was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average sales price per carton compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase of 2% in the volume of tomatoes.\nPrepared products\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021:\nNet sales for the Prepared products business increased by approximately $23.5 million, or 5%, for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. This increase in Prepared product sales during the year ended October 31, 2022 was due primarily to increased sales prices of fresh-cut fruit & vegetables and prepared foods products. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales of guacamole products due to overall lower sales volume.\nNet sales for fresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods products for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period increased $27.1 million, or 7%. This increase primarily reflects price increases of 14% as well as a favorable product mix, partially offset by a 7% decrease in sales volumes.\nNet sales for guacamole products for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period decreased $3.2 million, or 4%, primarily due to a decrease in the total volume sold.\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020:\nNet sales for the Prepared products business decreased by approximately $6.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period.\nNet sales for fresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods products for the year ended October 31, 2021, when compared to the prior year period, decreased $8.3 million, or 2%. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales out of the Midwest, relating to the closure of Prepared's co-packing partner in that region, which occurred in April 2020. This was partially offset by additional sales in regions where we added manufacturing capacity. Additionally, changing consumer demand and buying patterns related to COVID-19 adversely impacted Prepared's sales during the year ended October 31, 2021.\nSales of guacamole products increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 3%, primarily related to an increase in the sales price per pound, partially offset by a decrease in pounds sold. The decline in pounds sold of guacamole products was due to a decline in demand from foodservice customers related to COVID-19 during the year.\nGross Profit\nThe following table summarizes our gross profit and gross profit percentages by business segment:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grown\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 50,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 47,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 47,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 73,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 57,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 89,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (loss) percentages:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grown\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary\nOur cost of goods sold consists predominantly of ingredient costs (primarily fruit and other whole foods), packing materials, freight and handling, labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with preparing food products, and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold. Gross profit increased by approximately $16.4 million, or 29%, for the year ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year period. The increase was attributable to gross profit increases in both our Grown and Prepared segments.\nGrown products\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021:\nDuring our year ended October 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, our Grown products segment gross profit increased $2.3 million or 4%. While our overall gross profit increased, our gross profit percentage decreased. For the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the gross profit percentages for avocados were 7.1% and 8.0%, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in gross profit for fiscal 2022 was the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican peso during the year ended October 31, 2022, which resulted in a $1.0 million net loss related to the remeasurement of peso-dominated net assets at our Mexican subsidiaries. For the year ended October 31, 2021, we had a remeasurement gain of $0.9 million.\nSignificant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Grown products segment.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022 we generated gross profit of $3.5 million from tomato sales, down from $3.7 million in the prior year period. The majority of our tomato sales are made on a consignment basis, in which the gross profit we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party, which usually is a percent of the overall selling price; however, we also purchase some tomatoes on the spot market to meet specific customer requests and have certain fixed overhead costs associated with our tomato operations which impact the overall gross profit realized from tomato sales. The gross profit percentage for consignment sales are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle, the average selling prices, and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third-party growers/packers. The decrease in tomato gross profit was due primarily to an increase in sales of tomatoes from third-party growers/packers. As discussed above, even though a majority of our tomato sales are made on a consignment basis, we had lower gross profit from third-party growers/packers compared to prior year.\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020:\nDuring our year ended October 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year period, our Grown products segment gross profit percentage was consistent. For each of the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the gross profit percentage for avocados was 8.0%. Gross profit benefited for fiscal 2021 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican peso during the year ended October 31, 2021, which resulted in a $0.9 million net gain related to the remeasurement of peso-dominated net assets at our Mexican subsidiaries. For the year ended October 31, 2020, we had a remeasurement loss of $1.0 million.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2021 we generated gross profit of $3.7 million from tomato sales, down from $5.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in tomato gross profit was due primarily to the year-over-year decrease in sales described in more detail above. The majority of our tomato sales are made on a consignment basis, in which the gross profit we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party, which usually is a percent of the overall selling price; however, we also purchase some tomatoes on the spot market to meet specific customer requests and have certain fixed overhead costs associated with our tomato operations which impact the overall gross profit realized from tomato sales. The gross profit percentage for consignment sales is dependent on the volume of fruit we handle, the average selling prices, and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third-party growers/packers.\nPrepared products\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021:\nThe increase in our Prepared products gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2022 was the result of increased gross profit for fresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods, partially offset by decreases in gross profit from guacamole products.\nFresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods products gross profit percentages for the year ended October 31, 2022 was 4.8%, compared to a loss of 0.9% for the same prior year period. The increase in gross profit for these products for the year ended October 31, 2022 was mainly due to increased sales prices and a reduction in distribution expenses, an improvement in product yield and labor productivity, and a reduction in costs related to the consolidation of operations in our Green Cove Springs, Florida facility into our Georgia facility.\nGuacamole products gross profit percentage for the year ended October 31, 2022 was 5.7% compared to a gross profit of 17.6% for the prior year period. The decrease in guacamole products gross profit was due primarily to higher raw product fruit costs associated with the same supply constraints that drove whole avocado prices to historically high levels, which increased manufacturing costs. Any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Prepared segment.\nManagement has considered the impact of current operating results as well as expected future results and has concluded that there were no impairment indicators regarding intangible assets carried on the balance sheet as of October 31, 2022. Management will continue to evaluate the impact of operating results on these considerations in future quarters.\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020:\nThe decrease in our Prepared products gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2021 was the result of decreased gross profit for fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, prepared foods, and guacamole products.\nFresh-cut fruit and vegetables and prepared foods' gross profit (loss) percentage for the year ended October 31, 2021 was (0.9)%, compared to 5.3% in the same prior year period. The declines in gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2021, was due to increased commodity costs, lack of availability of key commodities, lower supply and higher turnover of labor that increased overtime costs and decreased efficiencies. In addition, gross profit (loss) was negatively impacted by the decreased sales that resulted from the closure of our Midwest co-packing partner.\nOur prepared avocado products gross profit percentage decreased to 16.9% of net sales, during the year ended October 31, 2021 compared to 27.8% during the prior year period. The decrease in our guacamole products' gross profit percentage was due primarily to an increase in fruit input costs, in addition to higher manufacturing costs relating to an overall decrease in guacamole pounds produced. Any significant fluctuation in the cost of fruit used in the production process or the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso may have a material impact on future gross profit for our Prepared segment.\nWe are experiencing operational challenges that impact our production facilities and our logistics network; the impact of higher prices for petroleum-based products, packaging materials and other commodities; and the availability of sufficient labor is increasing costs.\nIn response to the inflationary costs described above, we have implemented price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future.\nIn October 2021, we announced the closure of Prepared's food processing operations at our Green Cove Springs (near Jacksonville), Florida facility, as part of our Project Uno profit improvement program. As of November 15, 2021, Prepared's portion of our Green Cove facility had ceased operations. We wrote down $8.7 million of leasehold improvements, $0.1 million of equipment, and $0.6 million of inventory. We also paid $0.4 million in employee severance\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 65,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 56,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 57,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $65.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.0 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in management restructuring costs that include recruiting fees and severance ($2.8 million), an increase in consulting services related to restructuring efforts ($2.0 million), an increase in our short-term incentive accrual ($1.4 million) and an increase in salaries primarily related to the investment in key personnel.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $56.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2021 include costs of marketing and advertising, sales expenses (including broker commissions) and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended October 31, 2021, when compared to the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefit expense due to the eliminations of staff positions ($1.9 million), a decrease in broker commission ($0.9 million) and a decrease in stock based compensation due to prior year stock grants for certain management transition expenses ($0.5 million). Partially offsetting these decreases is an increase in professional service fees ($1.4 million), an increase in travel and entertainment ($0.5 million) and an increase in IT expenses ($0.4 million).\nLoss from Unconsolidated Entities\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (564)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (1,719)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,110)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from unconsolidated entities includes our allocation of earnings or losses from our investments in FreshRealm and Don Memo.

These discrete items were primarily related to rate differentials related to our carryback losses from prior years and the lack of deductibility of certain Mexican tax expenses. In addition, we recognized additional income tax provision expenses during fiscal 2022 related to the recording of additional valuation allowance and other permanent differences.\nIn June 2021, we paid $2.4 million related to the settlement of the 2011 Assessment (See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information). Of this amount, $1.5 million was included as a discrete item in income tax provision and $0.9 million related to value added taxes was included in expenses related to Mexican tax matters in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nIn July 2021, based on our evaluation of the most probable outcomes of the 2013 Assessment, we recorded an accrual for uncertain tax positions of $11 million in the accompanying financials, as a discrete item in tax provision expense. An additional $0.6 million of related professional fees was also recorded as expenses related to the Mexican tax matters. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOur effective tax rate without the above discrete items was approximately 21.7% for the year ended October 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate for year ended October 31, 2021 was approximately 146.6%. The distortive effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 differs from that of prior fiscal periods primarily due to the impacts of one-time tax events including the 2011 and 2013 Mexico Assessments, tax rate arbitrage on carryback claims under the CARES Act, and near break-even pre-tax operations relative to prior fiscal periods.

Fiscal year 2022 operating cash flows reflect our net loss of $6.6 million, net increase of noncash charges (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for losses on accounts receivable, losses from unconsolidated entities, net losses on Limoneira shares, deferred taxes, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, loss on the reserve for FreshRealm, impairment related to Prepared's Florida facility closure and gain on the sale of the Temecula packinghouse) of $29.1 million and a net increase from changes in the non-cash components of our working capital accounts of approximately $27.6 million.\nIncreases in operating cash flows caused by working capital changes include a decrease in accounts receivable of $19.9 million, a net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $10.4 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $8.1 million, and a decrease in inventory of $1.8 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $5.0 million, an increase in advances to suppliers of $4.7 million, and a decrease in payable to growers of $2.8 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.1 million.\nThe decrease in our accounts receivable is due to improvements in our working capital practices and lower sales in October 2022 compared to the same prior year period. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily related to an increase in payables related to an increase in freight and other costs. The increase in income taxes payable is due to a combination of discrete tax items and income tax refunds in fiscal 2022. The decrease in our inventory as of October 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to a combination of lower inventory of Mexican avocados and prepared avocado products. The increase in other assets is primarily related to the increase in IVA receivable in fiscal 2022. The increase in advances to suppliers is mainly due to advances to our tomato growers for fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in payable to growers is mostly due to lower sales prices for Mexican avocados in the month of October 2022 compared to October 2021.\nCash provided by investing activities was $8.0 million for fiscal year 2022. Cash used in investing activities was $9.6 million and $31.9 million for fiscal years 2021, and 2020. Fiscal year 2022 cash flows provided by investing activities includes the proceeds received on the sale of Limoneira stock of $18.5 million, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment of $10.5 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $57.8 million, $5.2 million and $0.9 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. Cash used during fiscal year 2022 primarily relates to the net payment on our credit facilities totaling $36.5 million, payment of a $20.3 million dividend, payments on long-term obligations of $1.1 million and the payment of minimum withholding taxes on net share settlement of equity awards of $0.1 million, partially offset by proceeds received from a failed leaseback of $0.2 million.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our Credit Facility. Restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $3.1 million and $2.9 million. Our working capital at October 31, 2022 was $23.7 million, compared to $38.0 million at October 31, 2021.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, the available Credit Facility, and other sources will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditures, working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months. We will continue to pursue grower recruitment opportunities and expand relationships with retail and/or foodservice customers to fuel growth in each of our business segments. We have a revolving credit facility with Bank of America as administrative agent and Farm Credit West as joint lead arranger. Under the terms of this agreement, we may draw on funds for both working capital and long-term productive asset purchases. For our line of credit the weighted-average interest rate was 4.9% and 2.2% at October 31, 2022 and 2021. Under this Credit Facility, we had $1.2 million and $37.7 million outstanding as of October 31, 2022 and 2021.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under \"Risks Related to Our Business\" included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the distribution of avocados, guacamole products, and other perishable food products throughout the United States. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocado products, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, and prepared foods including sandwiches, salads, parfaits and ready-to-eat snack items among other products and (iii) process and package guacamole and salsa. We distribute our products both domestically and internationally.\nOn April 13, 2022, we announced plans to reorganize our business into two reporting segments, Grown and Prepared. The management transition to operate as Grown and Prepared began at the start of the third quarter of 2022. The Grown segment consists of fresh avocados, tomatoes and papayas. The Prepared segment comprises all other products including fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, ready-to-eat sandwiches, wraps, salads and snacks, guacamole, and salsa sold at retail and food service as well as avocado pulp sold to foodservice. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.\nOur Grown products business grades, sizes, packs, cools, and ripens (if desired) avocados for delivery to our customers. During fiscal 2022, we operated four packinghouses and four operating and distributing facilities (aka value-added depots or VADs) that handle avocados that are sold across the United States and to select international markets. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We believe our diversified avocado sources help provide a level of relative supply stability that may, over time, serve to increase the availability and demand for avocados among consumers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have an impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Prepared business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail and other channels. Prepared products include guacamole products (including both frozen and fresh), salsa, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. Prepared products are marketed under the Calavo, Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs. We believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Our Prepared business maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Grown and Prepared segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nSale of Investment in Limoneira\nOn October 27, 2022, we sold 1,677,299 shares of Limoneira common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $18.5 million. We used the net proceeds thereof after payment of commissions and expenses to pay down borrowings on our credit facility with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders thereto. Contemporaneously with such sale, Bank of America, as administrative agent, released its lien on such shares in accordance with terms of the Credit Facility and the related loan documents.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created challenging and unprecedented conditions for our business, and the global economy, disrupting global supply chains, changing certain purchasing norms in retail and foodservice channels and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This has resulted in inflationary and cost pressures that adversely impacted, our production and distribution costs, including costs of raw materials, packaging, labor, and freight.\nWe continue to experience increased labor costs, commodity costs and logistical costs in the current economic climate and as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing higher costs attributed to operational challenges that impact our production facilities and our logistics network; the impact of higher prices for petroleum-based products, packaging materials and other commodities; and the availability of labor.\nIn response to the inflationary costs described above, we have implemented price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future. Customers may not accept price increases or we may face competitive pressure that leads to price reductions for certain products.\nIncreasing volume of foreign grown avocados\nThe market for avocados is impacted by an increasing volume of foreign grown avocados being imported into the United States. Recently, there have been significant plantings of avocados in Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia and other parts of the world, which have had, and will continue to have, the effect of increasing the volume of foreign grown avocados entering the United States market.\nDividend payment\nIn November 2022, we announced that we will begin declaring and paying dividends quarterly rather than annually as had been our practice. On December 14, 2022, we paid a dividend of $0.2875 per share, or an aggregate of $5.2 million, to shareholders of record on November 16, 2022.\nProject Uno\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company launched Project Uno, a strategic set of initiatives that seeks to identify areas of operating efficiencies and cost savings to expand profit margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. We have undertaken multiple productivity and transformation initiatives, including (1) closure of the Prepared Florida plant\nand transfer of its viable operations into Prepared Georgia, (2) implementing broader supply chain operational improvements, (3) integrating our commercial, logistics, IT, procurement and accounting functions across the three divisions, (4) product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow moving stock keeping units and (5) outsourcing certain functions in our North American business to third-party service providers and the associated implementation of new procurement technology solutions.\nAs Project Uno has progressed, we have embedded operating controls and initiatives outlined by Project Uno into our regular operating procedures. As such, we anticipate the financial impact of Project Uno will simply be embedded in our financial results of operations as opposed to separately disclosed.\nMexico tax audits\nIn January 2017, we received preliminary observations from the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria in Mexico (the SAT\u201d) related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nOn February 4, 2022, we had a follow-up meeting with the SAT in Mexico City to begin a dialog with the objective of reaching a settlement of the 2013 Assessment. The SAT agreed in principle to continue this dialog, but requested that we provide a financial guaranty to secure the related tax as a pre-requisite to these discussions.\nOn February 25, 2022, we filed an injunction to challenge the SAT's response issued to the Reconsideration. This would allow time to continue the discussions with SAT at the administrative level and would give SAT the legal basis to issue a new resolution. This injunction suit represents a further opportunity for a Court of Law to analyze this matter from a constitutional perspective.\nThe injunction suit was admitted for analysis by the District Court, however, SAT filed a complaint (queja) against the ruling allowing Calavo de Mexico ( CDM\u201d) to file an extension of the injunction suit. This complaint was filed by SAT to challenge the admission and analysis of the injunction suit; this complaint was decided by the Circuit Courts in October 2022 against the SAT complaint and the Court will start the analysis of injunction in the following months.\nOn March 4, 2022, the Annulment Suit was formally accepted by the Federal Tax Court, which simultaneously granted a provisional suspension of the collections proceedings by the SAT. The acceptance by the court of the Annulment Suit renders the 2013 Assessment as non-definitive, until such time as the suit is resolved.\nOn March 10, 2022, we met with the SAT and offered an Administrative Guaranty (Embargo en Via Administrativa) to secure the 2013 Assessment, which provides the SAT with certain administrative rights to CDM assets in the unlikely event we do not prevail in our actions through the Federal Tax Court (see below). Once the Administrative Guaranty is in place, the existing liens over the assets of CDM will be removed and the SAT collection process will be suspended.\nOn April 27, 2022, the SAT provided a Positive Compliance Opinion to CDM, and consequently the Tax Authority renewed the VAT Certification to CDM. These two resolutions signal a positive development on the Tax controversies in Mexico.\nOn October 10, 2022, the Tax Court ruled in favor of CDM granting the definitive suspension, accepting the Administrative Guaranty and forcing the SAT to remove all liens placed on CDM fixed assets and bank accounts. The Court also recognized that the $3.1 billion pesos assessment exceeds the economic capacity of CDM.\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million USD\nin the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October 31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable\nHistorically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, the tax authorities began objecting to refund requests and supporting documentation that had previously been deemed acceptable to process a refund. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nIn April 2022, the Tax Court issued the ruling for the months of July, August and September 2015 through which it was declared that the following resolutions were resolved:\n \u25cf It is recognized that CDM operates as a maquila under the authorization of the Ministry of Finance. \n \u25cf It is recognized that all bank deposits corresponding to the purchase of avocados on behalf of Calavo Growers Inc. (CGI), are subject to the maquila program and it is not accruable income for purposes of Income Tax nor activities subject to VAT. \n \u25cf It is recognized that VAT is recoverable, since CDM demonstrated the existence of operations carried under the maquila services. \n \u25cf Resolved that certain VAT amounts attributed to the purchase of certain packing materials are not recoverable as CDM was not the buyer on record and therefore did not pay for the materials, which approximated $6.9 million pesos (approximately $0.3 million USD). \nThe court is still reviewing the appeal filed by the Company on May 9, 2022, against the ruling resolving that certain VAT amounts are not recoverable.\nThe latest court resolution sustains the Company's position that it is entitled to substantially all of its VAT amounts, and the Company is considering its options for collecting the entire VAT receivable. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented, and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, as of October 31, 2022, CDM has filed Administrative Appeals for months for which IVA refunds have been denied by the SAT, and will continue filing such appeals for any months for which refunds are denied in the future. Therefore, it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, IVA tax receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on volume purchased and our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $0.1 million.\n2013 Mexican Tax Audit Assessment. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nAs a result, in July 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment totaling approximately $2.6 billion Mexican pesos (which includes annual adjustments for inflation, and equals approximately $131.3 million USD at October 31, 2022) related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and value added tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. This amount has been adjusted for inflation as of October 31, 2022 to the amount of $3 billion Mexican pesos (approximately $151.5 million USD). Additionally, the tax authorities have determined that we owe our employee's profit-sharing liability, totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos (approximately $6.0 million USD at October 31, 2022).\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October\n31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable. As of October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2021, CDM IVA receivables totaled $43.6 million (865.4 million Mexican pesos) and $37.5 million (762.1 million Mexican pesos). Historically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, however, the tax authorities began carrying out more detailed reviews of our refund requests and our supporting documentation. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the tax authorities informed us that their internal opinion, based on the information provided by the local SAT office, considers that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure and therefore CDM cannot claim the refundable IVA balance. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. CDM started an Administrative Appeal for the IVA related to the request of the months of July, August and September of 2015 (the 2015 Appeal\u201d) in order to assert its argument that CDM is properly documented and to therefore change the SAT's internal assessment. In August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan on the 2015 Appeal indicating that they believe CDM's legal interpretation of its declared tax structure is indeed accurate. While favorable on this central matter of CDM's declared tax structure, the ruling, however, still does not recognize the taxpayers right to a full refund for the IVA related to the months of July, August and September 2015. Therefore, in October 2018, CDM filed a substance-over-form Annulment Suit in the Federal Tax Court to recover its full refund for IVA over the subject period, which is currently pending resolution.\nIn spite of the favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan, as discussed above, the local SAT office has denied our refund claims and continues to believe that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure. As a result, they believe CDM cannot claim certain refundable IVA balances, specifically regarding our IVA refunds since January through October 2017. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, CDM has filed an Administrative Appeals for the IVA related to the preceding months. A response to these Administrative Appeals is currently pending resolution.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Company is currently considering its options for resolution of the VAT receivables. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years. This estimated time could be impacted and delayed by the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. Therefore, we believe that it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts. However, there is no assurance that we will collect the full amount reflected in our financial statements.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's allocated goodwill exceeds the unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.\nAs a result of the Company's operating segment realignment, the composition of its reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment was changed. RFG reporting unit goodwill is now included within the Prepared reporting unit. Therefore, goodwill of $24.7 million, which was previously recorded within the RFG reporting unit, is now within our Prepared segment and $4.0 million, previously recorded within the Fresh reporting unit, is now in our Grown segment. Prior to the change in its reporting unit, the Company tested goodwill for impairment at the previous reporting unit, which did not result in any impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company's estimated fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value in our quantitative assessment of the Company's impairment test. The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow methodology. To corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis, a market approach is utilized using observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded. The Company concluded based on quantitative assessment tests that no goodwill impairment existed in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units which includes forecasted cash flow. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe below tables include non-GAAP measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\u201d\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) interest income and expense, (2) income taxes (benefit) provision, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA with further adjustments for (1) non-cash net losses (income) recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted EBITDA is a primary metric by which management evaluates the operating performance of the business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to other factors, the Company's senior management is compensated. The adjustments to calculate EBITDA and adjusted\nEBITDA are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted net income and the related measure of adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables below.\nItems are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

As a result of our investment in packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities, and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado volume. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various perishable foods, such as tomatoes and papayas, complement our offerings of avocados. From time to time, we continue to explore the distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to our business.\nOur Prepared business produces, markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers sold through the retail and other channels. Prepared products include guacamole products (including both frozen and fresh), salsa, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr\u00e9e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products, as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kit components and salad kits. Prepared products are marketed under the Calavo, Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand and private label programs. We believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today's foodservice and retail customers. Our Prepared business maintains relationships with foodservice companies and food retailers. We continue to seek to expand our relationships with major foodservice companies and food retailers and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace.\nThe operating results of all of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, including but not limited to pests and disease, weather patterns, changes in demand by consumers, food safety advisories impacting the fresh perishable food categories in which we currently operate, the timing of the receipt, reduction, or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products, our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products on a timely basis, the availability, quality and price of raw materials, new product introductions by our competitors, the utilization of production capacity at our various plant locations, change in the mix of products that our Grown and Prepared segments sell, and general economic conditions. We believe, however, that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nSale of Investment in Limoneira\nOn October 27, 2022, we sold 1,677,299 shares of Limoneira common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $18.5 million. We used the net proceeds thereof after payment of commissions and expenses to pay down borrowings on our credit facility with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders thereto. Contemporaneously with such sale, Bank of America, as administrative agent, released its lien on such shares in accordance with terms of the Credit Facility and the related loan documents.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created challenging and unprecedented conditions for our business, and the global economy, disrupting global supply chains, changing certain purchasing norms in retail and foodservice channels and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This has resulted in inflationary and cost pressures that adversely impacted, our production and distribution costs, including costs of raw materials, packaging, labor, and freight.\nWe continue to experience increased labor costs, commodity costs and logistical costs in the current economic climate and as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing higher costs attributed to operational challenges that impact our production facilities and our logistics network; the impact of higher prices for petroleum-based products, packaging materials and other commodities; and the availability of labor.\nIn response to the inflationary costs described above, we have implemented price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future. Customers may not accept price increases or we may face competitive pressure that leads to price reductions for certain products.\nIncreasing volume of foreign grown avocados\nThe market for avocados is impacted by an increasing volume of foreign grown avocados being imported into the United States. Recently, there have been significant plantings of avocados in Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia and other parts of the world, which have had, and will continue to have, the effect of increasing the volume of foreign grown avocados entering the United States market.\nDividend payment\nIn November 2022, we announced that we will begin declaring and paying dividends quarterly rather than annually as had been our practice. On December 14, 2022, we paid a dividend of $0.2875 per share, or an aggregate of $5.2 million, to shareholders of record on November 16, 2022.\nProject Uno\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company launched Project Uno, a strategic set of initiatives that seeks to identify areas of operating efficiencies and cost savings to expand profit margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. We have undertaken multiple productivity and transformation initiatives, including (1) closure of the Prepared Florida plant\nand transfer of its viable operations into Prepared Georgia, (2) implementing broader supply chain operational improvements, (3) integrating our commercial, logistics, IT, procurement and accounting functions across the three divisions, (4) product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow moving stock keeping units and (5) outsourcing certain functions in our North American business to third-party service providers and the associated implementation of new procurement technology solutions.\nAs Project Uno has progressed, we have embedded operating controls and initiatives outlined by Project Uno into our regular operating procedures. As such, we anticipate the financial impact of Project Uno will simply be embedded in our financial results of operations as opposed to separately disclosed.\nMexico tax audits\nIn January 2017, we received preliminary observations from the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria in Mexico (the SAT\u201d) related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nOn February 4, 2022, we had a follow-up meeting with the SAT in Mexico City to begin a dialog with the objective of reaching a settlement of the 2013 Assessment. The SAT agreed in principle to continue this dialog, but requested that we provide a financial guaranty to secure the related tax as a pre-requisite to these discussions.\nOn February 25, 2022, we filed an injunction to challenge the SAT's response issued to the Reconsideration. This would allow time to continue the discussions with SAT at the administrative level and would give SAT the legal basis to issue a new resolution. This injunction suit represents a further opportunity for a Court of Law to analyze this matter from a constitutional perspective.\nThe injunction suit was admitted for analysis by the District Court, however, SAT filed a complaint (queja) against the ruling allowing Calavo de Mexico ( CDM\u201d) to file an extension of the injunction suit. This complaint was filed by SAT to challenge the admission and analysis of the injunction suit; this complaint was decided by the Circuit Courts in October 2022 against the SAT complaint and the Court will start the analysis of injunction in the following months.\nOn March 4, 2022, the Annulment Suit was formally accepted by the Federal Tax Court, which simultaneously granted a provisional suspension of the collections proceedings by the SAT. The acceptance by the court of the Annulment Suit renders the 2013 Assessment as non-definitive, until such time as the suit is resolved.\nOn March 10, 2022, we met with the SAT and offered an Administrative Guaranty (Embargo en Via Administrativa) to secure the 2013 Assessment, which provides the SAT with certain administrative rights to CDM assets in the unlikely event we do not prevail in our actions through the Federal Tax Court (see below). Once the Administrative Guaranty is in place, the existing liens over the assets of CDM will be removed and the SAT collection process will be suspended.\nOn April 27, 2022, the SAT provided a Positive Compliance Opinion to CDM, and consequently the Tax Authority renewed the VAT Certification to CDM. These two resolutions signal a positive development on the Tax controversies in Mexico.\nOn October 10, 2022, the Tax Court ruled in favor of CDM granting the definitive suspension, accepting the Administrative Guaranty and forcing the SAT to remove all liens placed on CDM fixed assets and bank accounts. The Court also recognized that the $3.1 billion pesos assessment exceeds the economic capacity of CDM.\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million USD\nin the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October 31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable\nHistorically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, the tax authorities began objecting to refund requests and supporting documentation that had previously been deemed acceptable to process a refund. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nIn April 2022, the Tax Court issued the ruling for the months of July, August and September 2015 through which it was declared that the following resolutions were resolved:\n \u25cf It is recognized that CDM operates as a maquila under the authorization of the Ministry of Finance. \n \u25cf It is recognized that all bank deposits corresponding to the purchase of avocados on behalf of Calavo Growers Inc. (CGI), are subject to the maquila program and it is not accruable income for purposes of Income Tax nor activities subject to VAT. \n \u25cf It is recognized that VAT is recoverable, since CDM demonstrated the existence of operations carried under the maquila services. \n \u25cf Resolved that certain VAT amounts attributed to the purchase of certain packing materials are not recoverable as CDM was not the buyer on record and therefore did not pay for the materials, which approximated $6.9 million pesos (approximately $0.3 million USD). \nThe court is still reviewing the appeal filed by the Company on May 9, 2022, against the ruling resolving that certain VAT amounts are not recoverable.\nThe latest court resolution sustains the Company's position that it is entitled to substantially all of its VAT amounts, and the Company is considering its options for collecting the entire VAT receivable. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented, and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, as of October 31, 2022, CDM has filed Administrative Appeals for months for which IVA refunds have been denied by the SAT, and will continue filing such appeals for any months for which refunds are denied in the future. Therefore, it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables, IVA tax receivables, inventories, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, promotional allowances, equity income/losses and impairment analysis from unconsolidated entities, loans to unconsolidated entities, income taxes, retirement benefits, and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Additionally, we frequently engage third party valuation experts to assist us with estimates described below. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this Annual Report.\nWe believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nPromotional allowances. We provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale, based on volume purchased and our historical experience. Our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales. The derived percentage is then applied to the current period's sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period. The offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities. When certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional, they are written off against this allowance. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified. We estimate that a one percent (100 basis point) change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately $0.1 million.\n2013 Mexican Tax Audit Assessment. In January 2017, we received preliminary observations from SAT related to an audit for fiscal year 2013 outlining certain proposed adjustments primarily related to intercompany funding, deductions for services from certain vendors/suppliers and IVA. We provided a written rebuttal to these preliminary observations during our second fiscal quarter of 2017.\nAs a result, in July 2018, the SAT's local office in Uruapan issued to CDM a final tax assessment totaling approximately $2.6 billion Mexican pesos (which includes annual adjustments for inflation, and equals approximately $131.3 million USD at October 31, 2022) related to Income Tax, Flat Rate Business Tax, and value added tax, related to this fiscal 2013 tax audit. This amount has been adjusted for inflation as of October 31, 2022 to the amount of $3 billion Mexican pesos (approximately $151.5 million USD). Additionally, the tax authorities have determined that we owe our employee's profit-sharing liability, totaling approximately $118 million Mexican pesos (approximately $6.0 million USD at October 31, 2022).\nWhile we continue to believe that the 2013 Assessment is completely without merit, and that we will prevail on the Annulment Suit in the Tax Court, and that we have court rulings in favor of CDM, we also believe it is in the best interest of CDM and the Company to settle the 2013 Assessment as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we believe that the above actions taken by CDM will encourage the SAT to agree to reach a settlement. In accordance with our cumulative probability analysis, based on factors such as recent settlements made by the SAT in other cases, the 2011 Assessment settlement reached by CDM with the MFM, and the value of CDM assets, we recorded a provision of $11 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as a discrete item in Income Tax Provision. The provision includes estimated penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments. We believe that this provision remains appropriate as of October 31, 2022 based on our cumulative probability analysis. We incurred $1.4 million of related professional fees for the year ended October\n31, 2022, which have been recorded in Expenses related to Mexican Tax matters. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nMexican IVA taxes receivable. As of October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2021, CDM IVA receivables totaled $43.6 million (865.4 million Mexican pesos) and $37.5 million (762.1 million Mexican pesos). Historically, CDM received IVA refund payments from the Mexican tax authorities on a timely basis. Beginning in fiscal 2014 and continuing into fiscal 2022, however, the tax authorities began carrying out more detailed reviews of our refund requests and our supporting documentation. Additionally, they are also questioning the refunds requested attributable to IVA paid to certain suppliers that allegedly did not fulfill their own tax obligations. We believe these factors and others have contributed to delays in the processing of IVA claims by the Mexican tax authorities. Currently, we are in the process of collecting such balances primarily through regular administrative processes, but these amounts may ultimately need to be recovered through Administrative Appeals and/or legal means.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the tax authorities informed us that their internal opinion, based on the information provided by the local SAT office, considers that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure and therefore CDM cannot claim the refundable IVA balance. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. CDM started an Administrative Appeal for the IVA related to the request of the months of July, August and September of 2015 (the 2015 Appeal\u201d) in order to assert its argument that CDM is properly documented and to therefore change the SAT's internal assessment. In August 2018, we received a favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan on the 2015 Appeal indicating that they believe CDM's legal interpretation of its declared tax structure is indeed accurate. While favorable on this central matter of CDM's declared tax structure, the ruling, however, still does not recognize the taxpayers right to a full refund for the IVA related to the months of July, August and September 2015. Therefore, in October 2018, CDM filed a substance-over-form Annulment Suit in the Federal Tax Court to recover its full refund for IVA over the subject period, which is currently pending resolution.\nIn spite of the favorable ruling from the SAT's Legal Administration in Michoacan, as discussed above, the local SAT office has denied our refund claims and continues to believe that CDM is not properly documented relative to its declared tax structure. As a result, they believe CDM cannot claim certain refundable IVA balances, specifically regarding our IVA refunds since January through October 2017. CDM has strong arguments and supporting documentation to sustain its declared tax structure for IVA and income tax purposes. With assistance from our internationally recognized tax advisory firm, CDM has filed an Administrative Appeals for the IVA related to the preceding months. A response to these Administrative Appeals is currently pending resolution.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Company is currently considering its options for resolution of the VAT receivables. In the unlikely event of an unfavorable resolution of the Administrative Appeals, we plan to file Annulment Suits with the Mexican Federal Tax Court. If these suits result in an unfavorable ruling, there is an option to appeal to the Collegiate Circuit Court. The estimated time for the resolution of these suits could be 2 - 3 years. This estimated time could be impacted and delayed by the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe that our operations in Mexico are properly documented and our internationally recognized tax advisors believe that there are legal grounds to prevail in collecting the corresponding IVA amounts. Therefore, we believe that it is probable that the Mexican tax authorities will ultimately authorize the refund of the corresponding IVA amounts. However, there is no assurance that we will collect the full amount reflected in our financial statements.\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets. Goodwill, defined as unidentified asset(s) acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition, is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's allocated goodwill exceeds the unit's fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.\nAs a result of the Company's operating segment realignment, the composition of its reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment was changed. RFG reporting unit goodwill is now included within the Prepared reporting unit. Therefore, goodwill of $24.7 million, which was previously recorded within the RFG reporting unit, is now within our Prepared segment and $4.0 million, previously recorded within the Fresh reporting unit, is now in our Grown segment. Prior to the change in its reporting unit, the Company tested goodwill for impairment at the previous reporting unit, which did not result in any impairment charge.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company's estimated fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value in our quantitative assessment of the Company's impairment test. The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using a combination of valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow methodology. To corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis, a market approach is utilized using observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded. The Company concluded based on quantitative assessment tests that no goodwill impairment existed in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the reporting units which includes forecasted cash flow. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as percentages of our total net sales, for the periods indicated:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended October 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses related to Mexican tax matters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and charges related to RFG Florida facility closure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of Temecula packinghouse\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.0)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recovery (loss) on reserve for FreshRealm note receivable and impairment of investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (3.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized and realized net loss (gain) on Limoneira shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1.1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1.3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe below tables include non-GAAP measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\u201d\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) interest income and expense, (2) income taxes (benefit) provision, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA with further adjustments for (1) non-cash net losses (income) recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted EBITDA is a primary metric by which management evaluates the operating performance of the business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to other factors, the Company's senior management is compensated. The adjustments to calculate EBITDA and adjusted\nEBITDA are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted net income and the related measure of adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables below.\nItems are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring,"}
