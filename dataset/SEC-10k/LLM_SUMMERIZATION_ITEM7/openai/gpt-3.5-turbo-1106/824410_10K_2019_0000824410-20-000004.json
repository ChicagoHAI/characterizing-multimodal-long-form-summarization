Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nNet income for Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled a record $116.4 million ($3.25 per diluted share) compared to $100.9 million ($2.82 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results from 2019 and 2018 included recovered interest income from previously acquired impaired loans of $1.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The results for 2018 also included the effect of merger expenses totaling $11.8 million (an after tax impact of $0.24 per share), which were associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. ( WashingtonFirst\u201d), compared to $1.3 million for 2019, which are associated with the pending acquisition of Revere Bank that is expected close in the beginning of the second quarter of 2020.\nThese results reflect the impact of following events:\n\uf0b7 Total loans at December 31, 2019 increased 2% compared to December 31, 2018. During this period, the Company experienced 7% growth in total commercial loans as investor real estate loans and owner occupied real estate loans grew by 11% and 7%, respectively. The impact of commercial loan growth was offset by the decline in the mortgage loan portfolio due to the impact of mortgage loan refinance activity driven by the current interest rate environment and the sale of the majority of new mortgage loan production and the decline in consumer loan balances.\n\uf0b7 Total deposits grew 9% compared to the end of 2018. Deposit growth reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 104% at the end of 2019 compared to 111% at the end of 2018. The year-over-year deposit growth included an 8% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, a 13% increase in core interest-bearing deposits and a 38% reduction in wholesale deposits.\n\uf0b7 The net interest margin was 3.51% in 2019, compared to 3.60% in 2018.\n\uf0b7 The provision for loan losses was $4.7 million for 2019 compared to $9.0 million for 2018, reflecting the overall improvement in the qualitative credit metrics of the loan portfolio during the previous twelve months in addition to lower loan growth than experienced in the prior year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest income increased 17% to $71.3 million for 2019, compared to $61.1 million for 2018. Excluding life insurance mortality proceeds of $0.6 million and $1.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, non-interest income increased 19%. This increase was driven by income from mortgage banking activities, which increased 108% from the prior year, to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the rise in mortgage lending activity during the year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $179.1 million for 2019 compared to $179.8 million for the prior year. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses compared to $1.3 million for the current year. Excluding merger expenses, non-interest expense rose 6%, driven primarily by increases in salaries and benefits. A portion of the increases in non-interest expense was offset by the significant decrease in FDIC insurance during the year.\n\uf0b7 The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 51.52% for 2019 compared to 50.87% for 2018.\n\uf0b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased 668,191 shares of common stock at an average price of $36.34 per share as part of its existing share repurchase program\n\uf0b7 The Company successfully issued $175 million in subordinated debt in November 2019. The debt will provide capital to support future growth in the real estate lending portfolio and fund anticipated future redemptions of existing higher priced funding sources.\nThe national economy, as well as the Mid-Atlantic region in which the Company operates, continued to exhibit a solid economic performance throughout 2019. Consumer confidence remains high as a result of certain positive economic trends such as reduced lending rates, low unemployment, stable housing prices and solid performance in the financial markets. These positive trends have been tempered by economic concerns over a lack of wage growth, the political environment, trade turmoil and the impact of regional conflict. These factors act to constrain economic activity from time to time on the part of both large and small businesses. Despite the mixed business environment, the Company has experienced consistent growth in focused areas while maintaining strong levels of liquidity, capital and credit quality.\nLiquidity continues to remain strong due to borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve and the size and composition of the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Bank remained above all well-capitalized\u201d regulatory requirement levels. Tangible book value per common share increased by 9% to $22.37 from $20.45 at December 31, 2018. The Company's credit quality remained strong as non-performing assets represented 0.50% of total assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.03% for 2019, compared to 0.01% for the prior year.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 increased 5% compared to December 31, 2018. Total loans at December 31, 2019, were $6.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018. During this period, the composition of the portfolio shifted as total commercial loans grew 7% while mortgage loans declined 8% due to the refinance activity and the strategic decision to sell the majority of new mortgage loan production. Consumer loans experienced a 10% decline related to recent mortgage refinancing activity. During this period, total funded commercial loan production was a record $884 million. Commercial loans originated during the current year had total unfunded commitments of $479 million as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer funding sources at year end 2019, which include deposits plus other short-term borrowings from core customers, increased 8% compared to year end 2018. The increase in customer funding sources was driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market savings accounts. The Company reduced FHLB borrowings by 39% during the year to assist in the management of the net interest margin. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company issued $175 million in subordinated debt. The proceeds from the debt provides capital for future growth in the real estate lending portfolio, in addition to providing funds to reduce higher priced funding sources.\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 6% to $1.13 billion as compared to $1.07 billion at December 31, 2018. The growth in stockholders' equity during 2019 was due to net income net of the dividends paid to stockholders. During 2019 the Company repurchased 668,000 shares, resulting in a $24.3 million reduction in stockholders' equity.\nNet interest income increased 2% to $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest margin was 3.51% compared to 3.60% for the prior year. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans as compared to $2.4 million in 2018. Excluding these recoveries, the net interest margin would have been 3.48% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amortization of the fair value adjustments for 2019 was estimated to be 5 basis points on an annual basis compared to a 13 basis point impact for the prior year. Compared to the prior year, average interest-earning assets grew 5% with an increase of 11 basis points in the yield while average interest-bearing liabilities grew 3% with an increase of 32 basis points in the rate paid.\nNon-interest income increased 17% in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by the increase in income from mortgage banking activities during 2019, as favorable residential lending rates during the year resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan originations. After excluding merger expenses from both years, non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 6% compared to the prior year due to the increase in compensation costs.\nNet income for 2019 included the effect of merger expenses totaling $1.3 million, which was offset by the $1.8 million in recovered interest income from previously acquired credit impaired loans. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses and $2.4 million of the interest recoveries, which resulted in an after-tax reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.19 per share for 2018. Pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the merger expenses in both years in addition to the provision for loan losses, increased 4% from 2018 to 2019 to a record $158.9 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value. A decline in the value of assets required to be recorded at fair value may warrant an impairment write-down or valuation allowance to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in greater financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when readily available. Management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results:\n\uf0b7 Allowance for loan losses;\n\uf0b7 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment;\n\uf0b7 Accounting for income taxes;\n\uf0b7 Fair value measurements;\n\uf0b7 Defined benefit pension plan.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Acquired performing loans have their fair values determined at the date of acquisition. A portion of the fair value is determined based on credit quality. Accordingly, those loans are not included in the total loan portfolio when determining the estimated allowance for probable loan losses. The Company monitors the acquired performing loans to ensure that the remaining portion of the acquisition fair value adjustment is equivalent or exceeds the estimated allowance under the Company's allowance methodology. The allowance is based on the basic principle that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of probable losses in the lending portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize probable losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the composition of loans in the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers as a result of changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, and independent consultants engaged by the Company periodically review the loan portfolio and the allowance. Such reviews may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses has two basic components: a general allowance (ASC 450 reserves) reflecting historical losses by loan category, as adjusted by several qualitative factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios, and specific allowances (ASC 310 reserves) for individually identified impaired loans. Each of these components, and the allowance methodology used to establish them, are described in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. The amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the Risk Committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board.\nGeneral allowances are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured over the prior eight quarters and weighted equally. The historical loss experience is supplemented by the inclusion of qualitative risk factors to address various risk characteristics of the Company's loan portfolio including:\n\uf0b7 trends in delinquencies and other non-performing loans;\n\uf0b7 changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio;\n\uf0b7 changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio;\n\uf0b7 concentrations of loans to specific industry segments;\n\uf0b7 changes in economic conditions on both a local, regional and national level;\n\uf0b7 changes in the Company's credit administration and loan portfolio management processes; and\n\uf0b7 quality of the Company's credit risk identification processes.\nThe general allowance comprised 90% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The general allowance is calculated in two parts based on an internal risk classification of loans within each portfolio segment. Allowances on loans considered to be criticized\u201d and classified\u201d under regulatory guidance are calculated separately from loans considered to be pass\u201d rated under the same guidance. This segregation allows the Company to monitor the allowance applicable to higher risk loans separate from the remainder of the portfolio in order to better manage risk and ensure the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe portion of the allowance representing specific allowances is established on individually impaired loans. As a practical expedient, for collateral dependent loans, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell the underlying collateral. For loans on which the Company has not elected to use a practical expedient to measure impairment, the Company will measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. In determining the cash flows to be included in the discount calculation the Company considers the following factors that combine to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses:\n\uf0b7 the borrower's overall financial condition;\n\uf0b7 resources and payment record;\n\uf0b7 demonstrated or documented support available from financial guarantors; and\n\uf0b7 the adequacy of collateral value and the ultimate realization of that value at liquidation.\nThe specific allowance accounted for 10% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated losses on impaired loans can differ substantially from actual losses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment assessment requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of recorded goodwill is required. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write-down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value. The Company assesses for impairment of goodwill as of October 1 of each year using September 30 data and again at any quarter-end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in future operating results, adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the Company to use a degree of subjectivity.\nUnder current accounting guidance, the Company has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment of these qualitative factors, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than the carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment process, previously required, is unnecessary. However, if it appears that the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on the qualitative assessment, the first step of the two-step process must be performed. The Company has elected this accounting guidance with respect to its Community Banking, Investment Management and Insurance segments. At December 31, 2019 there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles in any of the Company's reporting units.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Examples of such assets include core deposit intangibles, acquired customer lists and other identifiable intangibles. Other intangible assets have finite lives and are reviewed for impairment annually. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line or sum-of-the-years basis over varying periods that initially did not exceed 15 years.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available-for-sale, residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements. Loans where it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis.\nThe Company conducts a quarterly review for all investment securities that have potential impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. Valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, valuations are based on pricing models, quotes for similar investment securities, and, where necessary, an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows. In addition, the Company considers the financial condition of the issuer, the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nThe above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in Note 22-Fair Value\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nThe Company has a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. The plan was frozen for existing entrants after December 31, 2007 and all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of December 31, 2007 based on past service. Future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur.\nSeveral factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan, including (1) the size and characteristics of the plan population, (2) the discount rate, (3) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (4) other actuarial assumptions. Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and the terms of the plan. As a result of the plan freeze, the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, which is December 31 of each year. The discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy. Should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns, this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, in March 2017. This guidance is intended to eliminate the current diversity in practice with respect to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under current GAAP, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. The amendments in this update shorten the amortization period for such callable debt securities held at a premium requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer for its fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, in January 2017. The objective of this guidance is to simplify an entity's required test for impairment of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In Step 2 an entity measured a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill, an entity had to determine the fair value at the impairment date of its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized assets and liabilities, following a procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under this Update, an entity should perform its annual or quarterly goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the reporting unit's fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit and the entity must consider the income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is an SEC filer for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2016-13, Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL), in June 2016. This guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. Under the new guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This will result in earlier recognition of loss allowances in most instances. Credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities (regardless of whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary) will be measured in a manner similar to the present, except that such losses will be recorded as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the related securities. With respect to trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the guidance requires that an entity estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance resulting in the net amount expected to be collected to be reflected as the financial asset. Entities will also be required to provide more disclosures, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. This guidance is effective for public business entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2019.\nThe Company completed implementation of the guidance and will adopt it in the first quarter of 2020. As a part of the implementation, the Company reconciled historical loan data, determined segmentation of the loan portfolio for application of the CECL calculation, determined the key assumptions, selected calculation methods, and established an internal controls framework. The Company also used the services of an independent third party advisor to validate the conceptual soundness of the proposed methodology framework and of the CECL model. At the adoption date, exclusive of the reclassification of $2.8 million to the allowance for credit losses of amounts related to the previously acquired impaired loans, the estimated impact to retained earnings at transition date is expected to be approximately $2.0 million based on the expected performance of the economy at the transition date. Future amounts of provision expense will depend on the size and composition of the loan portfolio, future economic conditions and borrower's payment performance.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of the Company's operating revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this discussion and analysis, the interest earned on tax-advantaged loans and tax-exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes. The result is referred to as tax-equivalent interest income and tax-equivalent net interest income. The following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the impact of the acquisition of WashingtonFirst and a review of the information provided in the table that provides yields and rates on average balances.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet interest income for 2019 was $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million for 2018, a 2% increase. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2019 was $270.1 million compared to $265.2 million for 2018. The net interest income growth during the current year from the prior year reflects the effects of the 11 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which grew 5%, which was largely offset by the 32 basis point growth in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Overall, the net interest margin decreased to 3.51% for 2019 compared to 3.60% for 2018. An analysis of the net interest income performance is presented in the following tables. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans compared to $2.4 million for the prior year. Exclusive of these recoveries the net interest margin would have been 3.48% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the amortization of the fair value adjustments in 2019 associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst was estimated to be a 5 basis point positive impact on the net interest margin for 2019, compared to a 13 basis point impact for the prior year.\nTable 9: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income Excluding Purchase Accounting Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,445\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accretion of fair value adjustment on pools of homogeneous loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,144)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,730)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accretion of loan fair value adjustment on purchased credit impaired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,073)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,860)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Settlements of purchased credit impaired loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,799)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,360)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accretion of fair value adjustment on certificates of deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(533)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,056)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Accretion of fair value adjustment on subordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(146)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income Excluding Purchase Accounting Adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,301\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 vs. 2017\nNet interest income for 2018 was $260.4 million compared to $168.8 million for 2017, a 54% increase, due to growth in earning assets coupled with the overall increase in the associated yields on those assets. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 was $265.2 million compared to $176.2 million for 2017. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income performance that reflects the net interest margin that increased to 3.60% for 2018 compared to 3.55% for 2017. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2.4 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans. This amount compares to interest recoveries of $1.1 million for 2017. Exclusive of these recoveries the net interest margin would have been 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The amortization of the fair value adjustments in 2018 associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst was estimated to be 13 basis points on an annual basis. This favorable margin effect was partially offset by the impact that the 2018 reduction in the tax rate had on the tax-advantaged securities in the investment portfolio, which adversely affected the margin by 5 basis points. Average interest-earning assets grew 48% in 2018 with an increase of 39 basis points in the yield compared to 2017 while the rate on average interest-bearing liabilities, which grew 51% from 2017, increased 47 basis points. The increase in the margin reflects the result of the proportionate mix of the interest-earning assets and associated yields as compared to the mix of interest-bearing liabilities and their associated

tax-equivalent interest income increased 7% during 2019 compared to the prior year driven by the increase in average loans and the increase in their associated yields during the year. In 2019, the average balance of the loan portfolio increased 6% while the average yield increased 11 basis points. The increase in average loan balances was primarily the result of growth in all of the loan portfolio categories with the exception of consumer loans. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans. This amount compares to interest recoveries of $2.4 million for 2018. Exclusive of these recoveries, the yield on loans would have increased 13 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe average yield on total investment securities remained stable while the average balance of the portfolio decreased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018. The decline in the average balance of the portfolio during the year was the result of the application of funds from the cash flows of the investment portfolio to reduce high rate borrowings rather than purchasing replacement investments, as investment rates declined during the year.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Company's total tax-equivalent interest income increased 63% during 2018 compared to the prior year as average loans and investments and their associated yields increased during the year. In 2018, the average balance of the loan portfolio increased 52% and average investments increased 25% compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in loans was primarily the result of the WashingtonFirst acquisition coupled with the 9% post-acquisition growth of the total loan portfolio. The post-acquisition organic loan growth was the result of greater market presence and the improvement in the regional economy. The yield on average loans increased by 48 basis points compared to the prior year due to higher yields on the entire loan portfolio due to the effect of the rising interest rate environment during 2018 from the multiple rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2.4 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans. This amount compares to interest recoveries of $1.1 million for 2017. Exclusive of these recoveries, the yield on loans would have increased 46 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe average yield on total investment securities decreased 23 basis points while the average balance of the portfolio increased 25% in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in the yield on investments was driven by the effect that the reduction in the corporate tax rate had on the tax-advantaged securities in the investment portfolio, which caused a 70 basis point erosion in the yield on tax-exempt securities.\nInterest Expense\n2019 vs. 2018\nInterest expense increased by $18.9 million or 30% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in interest expense was driven by the combination of deposit growth and higher rates paid on deposits. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by a combination of the decline in the interest expense on average FHLB advances, which declined 34%, and the benefit realized from an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a reduction in wholesale deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew 3% due to the 13% growth in average interest-bearing deposits while total average borrowings decreased 28% during the year. Average deposit growth was primarily the result of the 14% growth in average money market deposits and 24% growth in average time deposits. The overall increase in the rate paid on deposits increased 39 basis points, and the rate paid on borrowings increased 36 basis points during 2019 compared to the prior year.\n2018 vs. 2017\nInterest expense increased by $37.6 million or 144% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in interest expense was driven by the combination of post-acquisition deposits and higher rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. The combined growth in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the acquisition of WashingtonFirst with the remaining growth driven by rate sensitive deposits and borrowings utilized to fund loan growth during the year. Average deposit growth was 48% during 2018 while average borrowed funds grew 49%. Average deposit growth was primarily the result of the 54% growth in average money market deposits and 98% growth in average time deposits. The overall rate paid on deposits increased 49 basis points and the rate paid on borrowings increased 45 basis points during 2018 compared to the prior year.\nInterest Rate Performance\n2019 vs. 2018\nThe Company's net interest margin decreased to 3.51% for 2019 compared to 3.60% for 2018 while the net interest spread decreased to 3.02% in 2019 compared to 3.23% in 2018. The decrease in the spread was the result of the increase in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the increase in the yields earned on interest-earning assets. The decrease in the margin reflects the impact of the 5% growth in average interest-earning assets as that average yield grew 11 basis but was more than offset by the 32 basis point increase in the rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities which grew 3% during the year. As a result of these changes during the year, interest expense grew 30% while interest income grew 7% which caused compression of the margin during the current year as compared to 2018.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Company's net interest margin increased to 3.60% for 2018 compared to 3.55% for 2017 while the net interest spread decreased to 3.23% in 2018 compared to 3.31% in 2017. The decrease in the spread was the result of the increase in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the increase in the yields earned on interest-earning assets. The increase in the margin reflects the result of the proportionate mix of the interest-earning assets and associated yields as compared to the mix of interest-bearing liabilities and their associated rates.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income amounts and trends are presented in the following table for the years indicated:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019/2018\n</td> <td>2019/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Securities gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.5)\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,083)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.1)\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Wealth management income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Insurance agency commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Income from bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,162)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Visa check fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Letter of credit fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(236)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Extension fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal non-interest income increased 17% to $71.3 million for 2019, compared to $61.0 million for 2018. The year ended December 31, 2019, included gains of $0.1 million on sales of investment securities compared to $0.2 million in 2018. Additionally, 2019 included life insurance mortality proceeds of $0.6 million as compared to $1.6 million for 2018. Excluding security gains and mortality proceeds from each year, non-interest income increased 19% in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increases in mortgage banking activities, wealth management income and fees from customer level commercial loan swaps during the year.\nService charges on deposits increased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increases in commercial analysis fees and net commercial returned item fees. Wealth management income is comprised of income from trust and estate services and investment management fees earned by West Financial Services, the Company's investment management subsidiary. Trust services fees increased 6% compared to the prior year, due to a combination of estate settlement fees and higher recurring fees. Investment management fees in West Financial Services increased 7% for 2019 compared to 2018, as assets under management grew 16% due to market activity and new client additions. Overall total assets under management grew to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Insurance agency commissions at December 31, 2018 grew 7% compared to the prior year as a result of increased income from commercial lines and physicians liability insurance. Income from bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) decreased 27% in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower mortality proceeds that were received in 2019 compared to 2018. The Company invests in bank owned life insurance products in order to manage the cost of employee benefit plans. At December 31, 2019 BOLI investments totaled $113.2 million as compared to $110.8 million at December 31, 2018. These policies are diversified by carrier in accordance with defined policies and practices. The average tax-equivalent yield on these insurance contract assets declined to 3.80% for 2019 compared to 5.32% for the prior year, as death proceeds declined during the current year versus the prior year. Other non-interest income increased 26% during the current year compared to the prior year as a result of fees from customer level commercial loan swaps and fees related to the commercial portfolio.\n2018 vs. 2017\nTotal non-interest income was $61.0 million for 2018, compared to $51.2 million for 2017. The year ended December 31, 2018, included gains of $0.2 million on sales of investment securities compared to $1.3 million in 2017. Excluding these gains, non-interest income increased 22% compared to the prior year period primarily due to increases in mortgage banking activities, wealth management income and BOLI insurance mortality proceeds. Mortgage lending operations acquired as part of the WashingtonFirst transaction contributed to significant growth in mortgage banking income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nService charges on deposits increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increases in commercial analysis fees, ATM and point of service fees and net commercial returned item fees. Trust services fees increased 7% compared to the prior year, due to a combination of higher recurring and estate settlement fees. Investment management fees in West Financial Services increased 16% for 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to a 7% increase in assets under management from the WashingtonFirst acquisition and new client additions and to a lesser extent, market activity. Overall total assets under management remained level at $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Insurance agency commissions at December 31, 2018 remained level compared to the prior year. Income from BOLI increased 80% in 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of $1.6 million in mortality proceeds that were received in the first half of 2018. BOLI investments totaled $110.8 million at December 31, 2018 and $95.7 million at December 31, 2017 and were well diversified by carrier in accordance with defined policies and practices. The average tax-equivalent yield on these insurance contract assets was 5.32% for 2018 compared to 4.21% for the prior year. The investment yield growth of these products from the prior year was the result of the acquisition of WashingtonFirst. Other non-interest income increased 13% during 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of the growth in credit related fees driven by the increased size of the commercial loan portfolio.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense amounts and trends are presented in the following table for the years indicated:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

million in 2019 compared to $179.8 million in 2018. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses compared to $1.3 million for the current year. Excluding merger expenses, non-interest expense rose 6% primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and benefit expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased 7% in 2019 due principally to higher salary expense and increased compensation derived from volume based commissions or the achievement of revenue targets. The average number of full-time equivalent employees decreased to 913 in 2019 compared to 922 for 2018. Benefit expense increased 16% during the current year due to the increase to the matching contribution for the employee 401(k) plan and in addition to increases in various employee benefit programs.\nOccupancy expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in rental expense. Equipment expenses also increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in software costs. Marketing expense for 2019 increased 14% compared to 2018 as a result of advertising campaigns initiated during the current year. Outside data services expense increased 15% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increased cost of contractual services with volume-based components. FDIC insurance expense decreased 56% in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of an assessment credit received during the year due to the industry deposit insurance fund reaching stipulated benchmark levels. Merger expenses associated with the pending Revere Bank acquisition totaled $1.3 million in 2019 as compared to merger expenses of $11.8 million in the prior year related to the WashingtonFirst acquisition. Amortization of intangibles decreased from the prior year as a result of the decreased amortization of the core deposit intangible that was recognized in the WashingtonFirst acquisition. Other non-interest expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by increased professional and consulting fees.\n2018 vs. 2017\nNon-interest expenses totaled $179.8 million in 2018 compared to $129.1 million in 2017. This increase in expenses was driven by merger expenses and the increased costs necessary to operate the larger post-acquisition entity.\nSalaries and employee benefits, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased in 2018 due principally to higher compensation expenses primarily as a result of the increased number of employees. The average number of full-time equivalent employees increased to 922 in 2018 compared to 729 for 2017. The majority of the increase occurred due to the increase in the number of branches and additional loan origination associates related to the acquisition of WahingtonFirst.\nOccupancy expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased rental and operations expense from the addition of WashingtonFirst branches. This cost was slightly tempered by savings realized from the consolidation of six branches in mid-2018. Equipment expenses also increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the effects of the larger post-acquisition company. Marketing expense for 2018 increased compared to 2017 as a result of increased focused advertising campaigns. Outside data services expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increased cost of contractual services with volume-based components. FDIC insurance expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increased size of the total asset assessment base. Merger expenses associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst totaled $11.8 million in 2018 as compared to $4.3 million in the prior year. Amortization of intangibles increased from the prior year as a result of the amortization of the core deposit intangible that was recognized in the acquisition. Other non-interest expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by increased professional and consulting fees, communication costs, volume based external fees and franchise taxes. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $1.3 million in prepayment penalties on the early pay-off of high rate FHLB advances. Excluding merger expenses from both years and the prepayment penalties from the prior year, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense was 36%\nOperating Expense Performance\nManagement views the GAAP efficiency ratio as an important financial measure of expense performance and cost management. The ratio expresses the level of non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue (net interest income plus total non-interest income). Lower ratios indicate improved productivity.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company also uses a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations. Management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the Company over time than does a GAAP ratio, and is highly useful in comparing period-to-period operating performance of the Company's core business operations. It is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non-interest expenses. However, this measure is supplemental, and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on GAAP measures. The reader is cautioned that the non-GAAP efficiency ratio used by the Company may not be comparable to GAAP or non-GAAP efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions.\nIn general, the efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non-interest income. Non-interest expenses used in the calculation of the non-GAAP efficiency ratio exclude merger expenses, goodwill impairment losses, litigation expenses, the amortization of intangibles, and other non-recurring expenses. Income for the non-GAAP ratio includes the favorable effect of tax-exempt income, and excludes securities gains and losses, which may vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses, and non-recurring gains. The measure is different from the GAAP efficiency ratio, which also is presented in this report. The GAAP measure is calculated using non-interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratios are reconciled and provided in the following table. The GAAP efficiency ratio improved for 2019 compared to the prior year as a direct result of the increase in net interest income. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio increased in 2019 compared to the prior year as a result of the 6% growth in non-GAAP non-interest expense exceeding the 5% growth in non-GAAP revenue.\nIn addition, the Company uses pre-tax, pre-provision income, excluding merger and litigation expenses, as a measure of the level of certain recurring income before taxes. Management believes this provides financial statement users with a useful metric of the run-rate of revenues and expenses that is readily comparable to other financial institutions. This measure is calculated by adding (subtracting) the provision (credit) for loan losses, the provision for income taxes, merger expenses and litigation expenses back to net income. This metric increased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase in non-interest income which grew 17% year over year.\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Efficiency Ratios\nTable 14: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax pre-provision pre-merger expense income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,355\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Plus Non-GAAP adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Litigation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,869)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Merger expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,371\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax pre-provision pre-merger income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,884\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio -

The resulting effective rates for each year were 24% for 2019, 24% for 2018 and 39% for 2017. The tax expense for 2017 included $5.5 million in additional income tax expense from the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted at the end of 2017. Exclusive of the impact of the additional tax expense, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 33%.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's total assets amounted to $8.6 billion compared to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2018. The year over year growth was mainly attributable to the growth in investment and loan portfolios and, to lesser extent, from the implementation of the requisite lease accounting standard that was implemented in 2019. Total loans at December 31, 2019, were $6.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018. Total deposits at December 31, 2019 were $6.4 billion compared to $5.9 billion at the end of 2018, a 9% increase during the period.\nLoans\nA comparison of loan portfolio for the years indicated is presented in the following table:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-to-Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,149,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,228,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,920)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,506)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial owner occupied real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,288,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial investor real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,169,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,958,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial AD&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>684,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>517,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,075)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,705,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,571,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $134 million or 2% at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. During this period, the Company experienced 7% growth in total commercial loans as investor real estate loans and owner occupied real estate loans grew by 11% and 7%, respectively. Commercial business and AD&C loan portfolios remained relatively stable compared to the prior year. Total funded commercial loan production during 2019 was a record $884 million. Commercial loans originated during the current year had total unfunded commitments of $479 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe impact of commercial loan growth was offset by the decline in the mortgage loan portfolio due to the impact of the sale of the majority of new mortgage loan production and the decline in consumer loan balances during 2019. As a result of the strategic decision to sell the majority of new mortgage loan production rather than retaining the loans in the portfolio, the resulting normal loan run-off resulted in a 6% decline in the residential mortgage portfolio. Residential construction loans decreased by $41 million or 22% at December 31, 2019 compared to the balance at December 31, 2018 due to a decline in lending volume as a result of competitive pricing in the market. The consumer loan portfolio decreased 10% at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, predominantly in the home equity loan portfolio. The attrition in the home equity portfolio was the by-product of the recent increase in mortgage loan refinancing activity as consumers refinanced their current mortgages and associated home equity loans with lower rate fixed rate products.\nAnalysis of Loans\nThe trends in the composition of the loan portfolio over the previous five years are presented in following table:\nTable 17:

The investment portfolio increased to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019, from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The investment portfolio's growth of 11% from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was the result of cash flows associated with the deposit growth experienced during 2019. In addition to the growth of the portfolio during 2019, the composition of the portfolio migrated from U.S. treasuries and government agencies and state and municipal securities to mortgage-backed and asset backed securities to provide for greater cash flow from investment portfolio. At December 31, 2019, mortgage and asset-backed securities comprised 50% of the investment portfolio compared to 34% at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, 98% of the investment portfolio was invested in Aa/AA or Aaa/AAA rated securities. The duration of the portfolio decreased to 3.5 years at December 31, 2019 compared to 3.9 years at December 31, 2018 as a result of the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2019. The composition and duration of the investment portfolio has resulted in a portfolio with low credit risk that is expected to provide the liquidity needed to meet lending and other funding demands. The portfolio is monitored on a continuing basis with consideration given to interest rate trends and the structure of the yield curve and with constant assessment of economic projections and analysis.\nMaturities and weighted average yields for investment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2019 are presented in the following table.

Deposit growth reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 104% at the end of 2019 compared to 111% at the end of 2018. The increase from year-end 2018 was driven by increases in non-interest bearing demand, interest-bearing demand and money market deposit categories. During 2019, money market accounts grew 15%, demand deposits grew 19%, core time deposits grew 8% and non-interest bearing deposits grew 8%. The increase in the money market deposit products can be attributed to focused deposit gathering efforts during 2019. During the year, money market accounts that established a linked demand deposit relationship were offered at promotional rates. This led to the double digit growth in both of these deposit products. Additionally, demand deposit growth was further supplemented through the initiation of a deposit sweep product offering instituted during 2019. Growth in certificates of deposit less than $100,000 occurred due to higher rates that were offered as part of the effort to gather deposits during the year. The growth in these categories of core deposits enabled the reduction of brokered deposit relationships and the resulting 2% decline in certificates of deposit greater than $100,000. Interest-bearing deposits represented 71% of total deposits with the remaining 29% in noninterest-bearing balances at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, interest-bearing deposits represented 70% of total deposits while 30% represented noninterest-bearing deposits.\nIn addition to the reduction of brokered deposits, total borrowings decreased 23% at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was the result of utilizing the growth in deposits to reduce the borrowing position of the Company as the rates paid on deposits were more favorable than the rates paid on certain borrowings. During the last quarter of 2019, the Company issued $175 million in subordinated debt at a 4.25% fixed-to-floating rate. The proceeds from the debt provides capital for future growth in the real estate lending portfolio, in addition to providing funds to reduce higher priced funding sources.\nCapital Management\nManagement monitors historical and projected earnings, dividends and asset growth, as well as risks associated with the various types of on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, in order to determine appropriate capital levels. Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was $1.13 billion compared $1.07 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase in stockholders' equity was due to net income in 2019, which was partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders during 2019. Additionally, during 2019 the Company repurchased approximately 668,000 shares resulting in a $24.3 million reduction in stockholders' equity. The ratio of average equity to average assets was 13.25% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 12.87% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBank holding companies and banks are required to maintain capital ratios in accordance with guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulators. These guidelines are commonly known as Risk-Based Capital guidelines. The actual regulatory ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy are summarized for the Company in the following table.\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ratios at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>14.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>11.21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.06%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td>11.06%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.90%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Leverage\n</td> <td>9.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory capital at December 31, 2019 is comprised of tier 1 capital of $794 million and total qualifying capital of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the most recent notification from the Bank's primary regulator categorized the Bank as a \"well-capitalized\" institution under the prompt corrective action rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Designation as a well-capitalized institution under these regulations is not a recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the Bank by federal bank regulators.\nThe minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Covered financial institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nTangible Common Equity\nTangible equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude the balances of goodwill and other intangible assets from stockholder's equity and total assets, respectively. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information to investors that may be useful in understanding our financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies.\nTangible common equity totaled $782.3 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $726.7 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets has increased to 9.46% compared to 9.21% at December 31, 2018. The growth in tangible common equity in 2019 is a direct result of the retention of earnings net of dividend paid during the year. As a result of stock repurchases during 2019, common equity was reduced by $24 million.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible book value per share are provided in the following table.\nTangible Common Equity Ratio - Non-GAAP\nTable 23: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,132,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,067,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>563,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,427\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(347,149)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(347,149)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,768)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,768)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,171)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,841)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,788)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(580)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(680)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>782,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,415\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,629,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,243,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,446,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,091,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,655,380\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(347,149)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(347,149)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,768)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85,768)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,171)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,841)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,788)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(580)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(680)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,274,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,886,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,360,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,004,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,571,071\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.04%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.07%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.66%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$20.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$20.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$18.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$18.17\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Risk\nThe fundamental lending business of the Company is based on understanding, measuring and controlling the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk entails both general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending, and risk specific to individual borrowers. The Company's credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to any single customer, industry or collateral type. Typically, each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience. Loans secured by personal property, such as auto loans, generally experience medium credit losses. Unsecured loan products, such as personal revolving credit, have the highest credit loss experience and for that reason, the Company has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending. Credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Generally, improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers, enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements. Improvements, if any, in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times. Inconsistent economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers, reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations.\nLoans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination as of the date of the acquisition are recorded at their initial fair value. Credit deterioration is determined based on the probability of collection of all contractually required principal and interest payments. These loans are not considered non-performing for reporting purposes but are managed and monitored in the same manner and using the same techniques and strategies as organically generated loans. In accordance with GAAP, the historical allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is not carried over to the Company's financial statements. The following credit related sections should be read in conjunction with the section Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal non-performing loans, which exclude acquired non-performing loans, increased 15% to $41.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $36.0 million at December 31, 2018. The growth in non-performing loans over the prior year occurred primarily as a result of increases in segments of the loan portfolio secured by real estate. During 2019, non-performing commercial loans increased $2.6 million while non-performing residential real estate loans increased $2.5 million. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.62% at December 31, 2019 from 0.55% at December 31, 2018. The diversification of the lending portfolio among different commercial, residential and consumer product lines along with different market conditions of the D.C. suburbs, Northern Virginia and Baltimore metropolitan area has mitigated some of the risks in the portfolio. The local economic conditions and levels of non-performing loans can be influenced by any volatility being experienced in various sectors of the economy on both a regional and national level. Management monitors the performance within various sectors of the portfolio.\nTo control and manage credit risk, management has a credit process in place to reasonably ensure that credit standards are maintained along with an in-house loan administration accompanied by oversight and review procedures. The primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrower's ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral. Oversight and review procedures include the monitoring of portfolio credit quality, early identification of potential problem credits and the proactive management of problem credits. As part of the oversight and review process, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses (the allowance\u201d).\nThe allowance represents an estimation of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio, which excluded the acquired portfolio, as any incurred credit losses have been embedded in the determination of the fair value of the acquired loans. The adequacy of the allowance is determined through careful and ongoing evaluation of the credit portfolio, and involves consideration of a number of factors, as outlined below, to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates, including estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends, which may be susceptible to significant change. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance, while recoveries are credited to the allowance. Management adjusts the level of the allowance through the provision for loan losses, which is recorded as a current period operating expense.\nThe methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes: (1) a general allowance that reflects historical losses supplemented by qualitative factors, as adjusted, by credit category, and (2) a specific allowance for impaired credits on an individual or portfolio basis. This methodology is further described in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by the Risk Committee of the board of directors.\nThe Company recognizes a collateral dependent lending relationship as non-performing when either the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or as a result of factors (such as bankruptcy, interruption of cash flows, etc.) considered at the monthly credit committee meeting. When a commercial loan is placed on non-accrual status, it is considered to be impaired and all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed. Classification as an impaired loan is based on a determination that the Company may not collect all principal and interest payments according to contractual terms. Impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as residential real estate and consumer loans. Typically, all payments received on non-accrual loans are first applied to the remaining principal balance of the loans. Any additional recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Integral to the assessment of the allowance process is an evaluation that is performed to determine whether a specific allowance on an impaired loan is warranted and, when losses are confirmed, a charge-off is taken to reduce the loan to its net realizable value. Further collateral deterioration can result in either further specific allowances being established or additional charge-offs. When additional deterioration becomes apparent, an action plan is developed for the particular loan and an appraisal will be obtained depending on the time elapsed since the prior appraisal, the loan balance and/or the result of the internal evaluation. A current appraisal on large loans is usually obtained if the appraisal on file is more than 12 months old and there has been a material change in market conditions, zoning, physical use or the adequacy of the collateral based on an internal evaluation. The Company's policy is to strictly adhere to regulatory appraisal standards. If an appraisal is ordered, no more than a 30 day turnaround is requested from the appraiser, who is selected by Credit Administration from an approved appraiser list. After receipt of the updated appraisal, the assigned credit officer will recommend to the Chief Credit Officer whether a specific allowance or a charge-off should be taken. The Chief Credit Officer has the authority to approve a specific allowance or charge-off between monthly credit committee meetings to ensure that there are no significant time lapses during this process.\nThe Company's methodology for evaluating whether a loan is impaired begins with risk-rating credits on an individual basis and includes consideration of the borrower's overall financial condition, payment record and available cash resources that may include the sufficiency of collateral value and, in a select few cases, verifiable support from financial guarantors. In measuring impairment, the Company looks primarily to the discounted cash flows of the project itself or to the value of the collateral as the primary sources of repayment of the loan. The Company may consider the existence of guarantees and the financial strength and wherewithal of the guarantors involved in any loan relationship. Guarantees may be considered as a source of repayment based on the guarantor's financial condition and respective payment capacity. Accordingly, absent a verifiable payment capacity, a guarantee alone would not be sufficient to avoid classifying the loan as impaired.\nManagement has established a credit process that dictates that structured procedures be performed to monitor these loans between the receipt of an original appraisal and the updated appraisal. These procedures include the following:\n\uf0b7 An internal evaluation is updated periodically to include borrower financial statements and/or cash flow projections.\n\uf0b7 The borrower may be contacted for a meeting to discuss an updated or revised action plan which may include a request for additional collateral.\n\uf0b7 Re-verification of the documentation supporting the Company's position with respect to the collateral securing the loan.\n\uf0b7 At the monthly credit committee meeting the loan status is examined and the loan may be downgraded and a specific allowance may be decided upon in advance of the receipt of the appraisal.\n\uf0b7 Upon receipt of the updated appraisal (or based on an updated internal financial evaluation) the loan balance is compared to the appraisal and a specific allowance is decided upon for the particular loan, typically for the amount of the difference between the appraisal and the loan balance, net of estimated cost to sell.\n\uf0b7 The Company will specifically reserve for or charge-off the excess of the loan amount over the amount of the appraisal net of closing costs. In certain cases the Company may establish a larger reserve due to knowledge of current market conditions or the existence of an offer for the collateral that will facilitate a more timely resolution of the loan.\nIf an updated appraisal is received subsequent to the preliminary determination of a specific allowance or partial charge-off, and it is less than the initial appraisal used in the initial assessment, an additional specific allowance or charge-off is taken on the related credit. Partially charged-off loans are not written back up based on updated appraisals and always remain on non-accrual with any and all subsequent payments applied to the remaining balance of the loan as principal reductions. No interest income is recognized on loans that have been partially charged-off.\nLoans considered to be troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) are loans that have their terms restructured (e.g., interest rates, loan maturity date, payment and amortization period, etc.) in circumstances that provide payment relief to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. All restructured loans are considered impaired loans and may either be in accruing status or non-accruing status. Non-accruing restructured loans may return to accruing status provided doubt has been removed concerning the collectability of principal and interest as evidenced by a sufficient period of payment performance in accordance with the restructured terms. Loans may be removed from the restructured category if the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty, a re-underwriting event took place and the revised loan terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement are considered to be consistent with terms that can be obtained in the credit market for loans with comparable risk.\nThe Company may extend the maturity of a performing or current loan that may have some inherent weakness associated with the loan. However, the Company generally follows a policy of not extending maturities on non-performing loans under existing terms. Maturity date extensions only occur under revised terms that clearly place the Company in a position to increase the likelihood of or assure full collection of the loan under the contractual terms and /or terms at the time of the extension that may eliminate or mitigate the inherent weakness in the loan. These terms may incorporate, but are not limited to additional assignment of collateral, significant balance curtailments/liquidations and assignments of additional project cash flows. Guarantees may be a consideration in the extension of loan maturities. As a general matter, the Company does not view extension of a loan to be a satisfactory approach to resolving non-performing credits. On an exception basis, certain performing loans that have displayed some inherent weakness in the underlying collateral values, an inability to comply with certain loan covenants which are not affecting the performance of the credit or other identified weakness may be extended.\nCollateral values or estimates of discounted cash flows (inclusive of any potential cash flow from guarantees) are evaluated to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses. The actual occurrence and severity of losses involving impaired credits can differ substantially from estimates.\nThe determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of probable losses in the loan portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. Historical net charge-offs represent a principal component in the application of the Company's allowance methodology. While management uses available information to recognize probable losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the credits comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as may result from changes in economic conditions. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, and independent consultants engaged by the Bank, periodically review the loan portfolio and the allowance. Such reviews may result in adjustments to the allowance based upon their analysis of the information available at the time of each examination.\nThe Company makes provisions for loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level, as established by use of the allowance methodology previously discussed. The provision for loan losses was $4.7 million in 2019, $9.0 million in 2018 and $3.0 million in 2017. The decrease in the provision for 2019 as compared to 2018 reflects the impact of lower organic growth in the loan portfolio year over year in addition to the impact of an improvement in the qualitative credit metrics of the loan portfolio and the stability of collateral values during the previous twelve months The provision for 2018 compared to compared to 2017 increased due to the effect of the organic loan growth in the portfolio year over year in addition to the impact of acquired loans being re-underwritten as they reached maturity under their original lending arrangements and ceased to be accounted for as acquired loans.\nThe Company typically sells a portion of its fixed-rate residential mortgage originations in the secondary mortgage market. Concurrent with such sales, the Company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The related sale agreements grant the purchasers recourse back to the Company, which could require the Company to repurchase loans or to share in any losses incurred by the purchasers. This recourse exposure typically extends for a period of nine to eighteen months after the sale of the loan although the time frame for repurchase requests can extend for an indefinite period. Such transactions could be due to a number of causes including borrower fraud or early payment default. The Company has seen a very limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers for such events and routinely monitors its exposure in this regard. The Company maintains a liability of $0.7 million for probable losses due to repurchases. The Company believes that this reserve is adequate.\nThe Company periodically engages in whole loan sale transactions of its residential mortgage loans as a part its interest rate risk management strategy. Neither the servicing assets associated with sales during 2018 or prior year periods, nor the income earned by the Company on its loan servicing rights during such periods, was significant. The Company did not engage in any whole loan sales during 2019.\nMortgage loan servicing rights are accounted for at amortized cost and are monitored for impairment on an ongoing basis. At both December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the amortized cost of the Company's mortgage loan servicing rights was $1.1 million. The Company did not incur any impairment losses during 2019.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe following table presents a five-year history for the allocation of the allowance for losses. The allowance is allocated in the following table to various loan categories based on the methodology used to estimate loan losses; however, the allocation does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or lease category.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,901\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>894\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total residential real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,795\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial investor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,440\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial owner occupied\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,984\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial AD&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,691\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,115\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,529\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,456\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,895\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, there were no changes in the Company's methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Variations can occur over time in the estimation of the adequacy of the allowance as a result of the credit performance of borrowers.\nAt December 31, 2019, total non-performing loans were $41.3 million, or 0.62% of total loans, compared to $36.0 million, or 0.55% of total loans, at December 31, 2018. The allowance represented 136% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 149% at December 31, 2018. While non-performing loans increased during the year, the related reserves for those loans remained relatively stable due to the adequacy of their collateral values. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.84% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 0.81% at December 31, 2018.\nContinued analysis of the actual loss history on problem credits in 2019 and 2018 provided an indication that the coverage of the inherent losses on problem credits was adequate. The Company continues to monitor the impact of economic conditions on its commercial customers, the status of the underlying collateral of non-accruals, inflow in criticized loans and early stage delinquencies. These credit metrics support management's outlook for credit quality performance and supports the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe balance of impaired loans was $24.8 million with specific allowances of $5.5 million against those loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $22.2 million with specific allowances of $4.9 million, at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's borrowers are concentrated in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and in Washington D.C. Commercial and residential mortgages, including home equity loans and lines, represented 88% of total loans at December 31, 2019 and 88% of total loans at December 31, 2018. Certain loan terms may create concentrations of credit risk and increase the Company's exposure to loss. These include terms that permit the deferral of principal payments or payments that are smaller than normal interest accruals (negative amortization); loans with high loan-to-value ratios; loans, such as option adjustable-rate mortgages, that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments that are in excess of increases that would result solely from increases in market interest rates; and interest-only loans. The Company does not make loans that provide for negative amortization or option adjustable-rate mortgages.\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance

had been current and in accordance with their original terms was $1.9 million. No interest income was accrued on these loans during the year. Please see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policy for placing loans on non-accrual status.\n(2) Performing loans considered potential problem loans, as defined and identified by management, amounted to $7.6 million at December 31, 2019. Although these are loans where known information about the borrowers' possible credit problems causes management to have concerns as to the borrowers' ability to comply with the loan repayment terms, most are current as to payment terms, well collateralized and are not believed to present significant risk of loss. Loans classified for regulatory purposes not included in either non-performing or potential problem loans consist only of \"other loans especially mentioned\" and do not, in management's opinion, represent or result from trends or uncertainties reasonably expected to materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources, or represent material credits where known information about the borrowers' possible credit problems causes management to have doubts as to the borrowers' ability to comply with the loan repayment terms.\n(3) Purchased credit impaired loans are not included in non-performing loans disclosure. As of December 31, 2019 these loans totaled $13.1 million.\nMarket Risk Management\nThe Company's net income is largely dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity.\nThe Company's interest rate risk management goals are (1) to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets, and (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest income as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets; by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched; by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits; and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis.\nThe Company's board of directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by management's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d). The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years. The Company measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the Company. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. As an example, certain money market deposit accounts are assumed to reprice at 40% of the interest rate change in each of the up rate shock scenarios even though this is not a contractual requirement. As a practical matter, management would likely lag the impact of any upward movement in market rates on these accounts as a mechanism to manage the Bank's net interest margin. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan, lease, and deposit products.\nThe Company prepares a current base case and eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and reports the analysis to the board of directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts are produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate.\nThe balance sheet is subject to quarterly testing for eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Projected interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although the Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment. It is management's goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. The Company augments its quarterly interest rate shock analysis with alternative external interest rate scenarios on a monthly basis. These alternative interest rate scenarios may include non-parallel rate ramps and non-parallel yield curve twists.\nMeasures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution's short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td>Estimated Changes in Net Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Interest Rates:\n</td> <td>+ 400 bp\n</td> <td>+ 300 bp\n</td> <td>+ 200 bp\n</td> <td>+ 100 bp\n</td> <td>- 100 bp\n</td> <td>- 200 bp\n</td> <td>-300 bp\n</td> <td>-400 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Limit\n</td> <td>23.50%\n</td> <td>17.50%\n</td> <td>15.00%\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>15.00%\n</td> <td>17.50%\n</td> <td>23.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>11.26%\n</td> <td>8.71%\n</td> <td>6.06%\n</td> <td>3.06%\n</td> <td>(3.47%)\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>2.74%\n</td> <td>2.29%\n</td> <td>2.38%\n</td> <td>1.15%\n</td> <td>(1.74%)\n</td> <td>(3.15%)\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, measures of net interest income at risk at December 31, 2019 had improved in every rising interest rate change scenario from December 31, 2018, however this measure declined in the decreasing interest rate scenario. All measures remained well within prescribed policy limits. The significant improvement in the risk position from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 in the rising rate scenarios is driven by the asset sensitivity that exists in the balance sheet. In the decreasing interest rate scenario, while the reduction in the FHLB borrowings during the year produced a positive impact, this was more than offset by effect from the shortened loan durations as interest rate decreased over the preceding twelve months.\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td>Estimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity (EVE)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Interest Rates:\n</td> <td>+ 400 bp\n</td> <td>+ 300 bp\n</td> <td>+ 200 bp\n</td> <td>+ 100 bp\n</td> <td>- 100 bp\n</td> <td>- 200 bp\n</td> <td>-300 bp\n</td> <td>-400 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Limit\n</td> <td>35.00%\n</td> <td>25.00%\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>25.00%\n</td> <td>35.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>(9.13%)\n</td> <td>(5.54%)\n</td> <td>(2.34%)\n</td> <td>(0.06%)\n</td> <td>(0.95%)\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>(10.23%)\n</td> <td>(7.18%)\n</td> <td>(3.61%)\n</td> <td>(1.70%)\n</td> <td>(0.77%)\n</td> <td>(2.80%)\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe measure of the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) at risk improved at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 in all rising rate interest rate change scenarios and eroded in the declining rate scenario. The primary driver of the improvements in the EVE risk position as rates rose was the result of the impact that lengthened durations and higher market interest rates had on core deposits, in addition to the recent issuance of the subordinated debt. These improvements in the EVE position were partially offset by the decline in the market values of loans and securities as the rise in rates lengthened their respective durations.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity is measured by a financial institution's ability to raise funds through loan repayments, maturing investments, deposit growth, borrowed funds, capital and the sale of highly marketable assets such as investment securities and residential mortgage loans. The Company's liquidity position, considering both internal and external sources available, exceeded anticipated short-term and long-term needs at December 31, 2019. Management considers core deposits, defined to include all deposits other than time deposits of $100 thousand or more, to be a relatively stable funding source. Core deposits equaled 67% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2019. In addition, loan payments, maturities, calls and pay downs of securities, deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements. In assessing liquidity, management considers operating requirements, the seasonality of deposit flows, investment, loan and deposit maturities and calls, expected funding of loans and deposit withdrawals, and the market values of available-for-sale investments, so that sufficient funds are available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise and to ensure that the Company is able to pursue new business opportunities.\nIn addition to factors discussed above that can affect liquidity, the Company's growth, mortgage banking activities and changes in the liquidity of the investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates are also taken into consideration. Under this approach, implemented by the Funds Management Subcommittee of ALCO under formal policy guidelines, the Company's liquidity position is measured weekly, looking forward at thirty day intervals from thirty (30) to three hundred sixty (360) days. The measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position, along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth. Resulting projections as of December 31, 2019, provides an indication of liquidity versus requirements that the Company utilizes to determine how it will fund loans and other earning assets.\nThe Company has external sources of funds that can be drawn upon when required. The main sources of external liquidity are available lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve. The line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta totaled $2.4 billion, all of which was available for borrowing based on pledged collateral, with $513.8 million borrowed against it as of December 31, 2019. The Company also had lines of credit available from the Federal Reserve of $443.3 million at December 31, 2019 collateralized by portfolio loans. In addition, the Company had unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks of $730.0 million at December 31, 2019. Outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit amounted to $75.0 million. Based upon its liquidity analysis, including external sources of liquidity available, management believes the liquidity position was appropriate at December 31, 2019.\nThe parent company ( Bancorp\u201d) is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, Bancorp is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common shareholders and interest and principal on outstanding debt. Bancorp's primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to Bancorp in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. Based on this requirement, as of December 31, 2019, the Bank could have declared a dividend of $167 million to Bancorp. At December 31, 2019, Bancorp had liquid assets of $90 million.\nArrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments (including lines of credit on revolving credit structures) and letters of credit. Approvals for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nNet income for Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled a record $116.4 million ($3.25 per diluted share) compared to $100.9 million ($2.82 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results from 2019 and 2018 included recovered interest income from previously acquired impaired loans of $1.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The results for 2018 also included the effect of merger expenses totaling $11.8 million (an after tax impact of $0.24 per share), which were associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. ( WashingtonFirst\u201d), compared to $1.3 million for 2019, which are associated with the pending acquisition of Revere Bank that is expected close in the beginning of the second quarter of 2020.\nThese results reflect the impact of following events:\n\uf0b7 Total loans at December 31, 2019 increased 2% compared to December 31, 2018. During this period, the Company experienced 7% growth in total commercial loans as investor real estate loans and owner occupied real estate loans grew by 11% and 7%, respectively. The impact of commercial loan growth was offset by the decline in the mortgage loan portfolio due to the impact of mortgage loan refinance activity driven by the current interest rate environment and the sale of the majority of new mortgage loan production and the decline in consumer loan balances.\n\uf0b7 Total deposits grew 9% compared to the end of 2018. Deposit growth reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 104% at the end of 2019 compared to 111% at the end of 2018. The year-over-year deposit growth included an 8% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, a 13% increase in core interest-bearing deposits and a 38% reduction in wholesale deposits.\n\uf0b7 The net interest margin was 3.51% in 2019, compared to 3.60% in 2018.\n\uf0b7 The provision for loan losses was $4.7 million for 2019 compared to $9.0 million for 2018, reflecting the overall improvement in the qualitative credit metrics of the loan portfolio during the previous twelve months in addition to lower loan growth than experienced in the prior year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest income increased 17% to $71.3 million for 2019, compared to $61.1 million for 2018. Excluding life insurance mortality proceeds of $0.6 million and $1.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, non-interest income increased 19%. This increase was driven by income from mortgage banking activities, which increased 108% from the prior year, to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the rise in mortgage lending activity during the year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $179.1 million for 2019 compared to $179.8 million for the prior year. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses compared to $1.3 million for the current year. Excluding merger expenses, non-interest expense rose 6%, driven primarily by increases in salaries and benefits. A portion of the increases in non-interest expense was offset by the significant decrease in FDIC insurance during the year.\n\uf0b7 The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 51.52% for 2019 compared to 50.87% for 2018.\n\uf0b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased 668,191 shares of common stock at an average price of $36.34 per share as part of its existing share repurchase program\n\uf0b7 The Company successfully issued $175 million in subordinated debt in November 2019. The debt will provide capital to support future growth in the real estate lending portfolio and fund anticipated future redemptions of existing higher priced funding sources.\nThe national economy, as well as the Mid-Atlantic region in which the Company operates, continued to exhibit a solid economic performance throughout 2019. Consumer confidence remains high as a result of certain positive economic trends such as reduced lending rates, low unemployment, stable housing prices and solid performance in the financial markets. These positive trends have been tempered by economic concerns over a lack of wage growth, the political environment, trade turmoil and the impact of regional conflict. These factors act to constrain economic activity from time to time on the part of both large and small businesses. Despite the mixed business environment, the Company has experienced consistent growth in focused areas while maintaining strong levels of liquidity, capital and credit quality.\nLiquidity continues to remain strong due to borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve and the size and composition of the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Bank remained above all well-capitalized\u201d regulatory requirement levels. Tangible book value per common share increased by 9% to $22.37 from $20.45 at December 31, 2018. The Company's credit quality remained strong as non-performing assets represented 0.50% of total assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.03% for 2019, compared to 0.01% for the prior year.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 increased 5% compared to December 31, 2018. Total loans at December 31, 2019, were $6.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018. During this period, the composition of the portfolio shifted as total commercial loans grew 7% while mortgage loans declined 8% due to the refinance activity and the strategic decision to sell the majority of new mortgage loan production. Consumer loans experienced a 10% decline related to recent mortgage refinancing activity. During this period, total funded commercial loan production was a record $884 million. Commercial loans originated during the current year had total unfunded commitments of $479 million as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer funding sources at year end 2019, which include deposits plus other short-term borrowings from core customers, increased 8% compared to year end 2018. The increase in customer funding sources was driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market savings accounts. The Company reduced FHLB borrowings by 39% during the year to assist in the management of the net interest margin. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company issued $175 million in subordinated debt. The proceeds from the debt provides capital for future growth in the real estate lending portfolio, in addition to providing funds to reduce higher priced funding sources.\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 6% to $1.13 billion as compared to $1.07 billion at December 31, 2018. The growth in stockholders' equity during 2019 was due to net income net of the dividends paid to stockholders. During 2019 the Company repurchased 668,000 shares, resulting in a $24.3 million reduction in stockholders' equity.\nNet interest income increased 2% to $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest margin was 3.51% compared to 3.60% for the prior year. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans as compared to $2.4 million in 2018. Excluding these recoveries, the net interest margin would have been 3.48% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amortization of the fair value adjustments for 2019 was estimated to be 5 basis points on an annual basis compared to a 13 basis point impact for the prior year. Compared to the prior year, average interest-earning assets grew 5% with an increase of 11 basis points in the yield while average interest-bearing liabilities grew 3% with an increase of 32 basis points in the rate paid.\nNon-interest income increased 17% in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by the increase in income from mortgage banking activities during 2019, as favorable residential lending rates during the year resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan originations. After excluding merger expenses from both years, non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 6% compared to the prior year due to the increase in compensation costs.\nNet income for 2019 included the effect of merger expenses totaling $1.3 million, which was offset by the $1.8 million in recovered interest income from previously acquired credit impaired loans. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses and $2.4 million of the interest recoveries, which resulted in an after-tax reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.19 per share for 2018. Pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the merger expenses in both years in addition to the provision for loan losses, increased 4% from 2018 to 2019 to a record $158.9 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value. A decline in the value of assets required to be recorded at fair value may warrant an impairment write-down or valuation allowance to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in greater financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when readily available. Management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results:\n\uf0b7 Allowance for loan losses;\n\uf0b7 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment;\n\uf0b7 Accounting for income taxes;\n\uf0b7 Fair value measurements;\n\uf0b7 Defined benefit pension plan.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Acquired performing loans have their fair values determined at the date of acquisition. A portion of the fair value is determined based on credit quality. Accordingly, those loans are not included in the total loan portfolio when determining the estimated allowance for probable loan losses. The Company monitors the acquired performing loans to ensure that the remaining portion of the acquisition fair value adjustment is equivalent or exceeds the estimated allowance under the Company's allowance methodology. The allowance is based on the basic principle that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of probable losses in the lending portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize probable losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the composition of loans in the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers as a result of changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, and independent consultants engaged by the Company periodically review the loan portfolio and the allowance. Such reviews may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses has two basic components: a general allowance (ASC 450 reserves) reflecting historical losses by loan category, as adjusted by several qualitative factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios, and specific allowances (ASC 310 reserves) for individually identified impaired loans. Each of these components, and the allowance methodology used to establish them, are described in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. The amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the Risk Committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board.\nGeneral allowances are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured over the prior eight quarters and weighted equally. The historical loss experience is supplemented by the inclusion of qualitative risk factors to address various risk characteristics of the Company's loan portfolio including:\n\uf0b7 trends in delinquencies and other non-performing loans;\n\uf0b7 changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio;\n\uf0b7 changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio;\n\uf0b7 concentrations of loans to specific industry segments;\n\uf0b7 changes in economic conditions on both a local, regional and national level;\n\uf0b7 changes in the Company's credit administration and loan portfolio management processes; and\n\uf0b7 quality of the Company's credit risk identification processes.\nThe general allowance comprised 90% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The general allowance is calculated in two parts based on an internal risk classification of loans within each portfolio segment. Allowances on loans considered to be criticized\u201d and classified\u201d under regulatory guidance are calculated separately from loans considered to be pass\u201d rated under the same guidance. This segregation allows the Company to monitor the allowance applicable to higher risk loans separate from the remainder of the portfolio in order to better manage risk and ensure the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe portion of the allowance representing specific allowances is established on individually impaired loans. As a practical expedient, for collateral dependent loans, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell the underlying collateral. For loans on which the Company has not elected to use a practical expedient to measure impairment, the Company will measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. In determining the cash flows to be included in the discount calculation the Company considers the following factors that combine to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses:\n\uf0b7 the borrower's overall financial condition;\n\uf0b7 resources and payment record;\n\uf0b7 demonstrated or documented support available from financial guarantors; and\n\uf0b7 the adequacy of collateral value and the ultimate realization of that value at liquidation.\nThe specific allowance accounted for 10% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated losses on impaired loans can differ substantially from actual losses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment assessment requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of recorded goodwill is required. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write-down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value. The Company assesses for impairment of goodwill as of October 1 of each year using September 30 data and again at any quarter-end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in future operating results, adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the Company to use a degree of subjectivity.\nUnder current accounting guidance, the Company has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment of these qualitative factors, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than the carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment process, previously required, is unnecessary. However, if it appears that the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on the qualitative assessment, the first step of the two-step process must be performed. The Company has elected this accounting guidance with respect to its Community Banking, Investment Management and Insurance segments. At December 31, 2019 there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles in any of the Company's reporting units.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Examples of such assets include core deposit intangibles, acquired customer lists and other identifiable intangibles. Other intangible assets have finite lives and are reviewed for impairment annually. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line or sum-of-the-years basis over varying periods that initially did not exceed 15 years.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available-for-sale, residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements. Loans where it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis.\nThe Company conducts a quarterly review for all investment securities that have potential impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. Valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, valuations are based on pricing models, quotes for similar investment securities, and, where necessary, an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows. In addition, the Company considers the financial condition of the issuer, the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nThe above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in Note 22-Fair Value\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nThe Company has a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. The plan was frozen for existing entrants after December 31, 2007 and all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of December 31, 2007 based on past service. Future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur.\nSeveral factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan, including (1) the size and characteristics of the plan population, (2) the discount rate, (3) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (4) other actuarial assumptions. Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and the terms of the plan. As a result of the plan freeze, the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, which is December 31 of each year. The discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy. Should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns, this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, in March 2017. This guidance is intended to eliminate the current diversity in practice with respect to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under current GAAP, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. The amendments in this update shorten the amortization period for such callable debt securities held at a premium requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer for its fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, in January 2017. The objective of this guidance is to simplify an entity's required test for impairment of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In Step 2 an entity measured a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill, an entity had to determine the fair value at the impairment date of its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized assets and liabilities, following a procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under this Update, an entity should perform its annual or quarterly goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the reporting unit's fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit and the entity must consider the income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is an SEC filer for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2016-13, Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL), in June 2016. This guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. Under the new guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This will result in earlier recognition of loss allowances in most instances. Credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities (regardless of whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary) will be measured in a manner similar to the present, except that such losses will be recorded as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the related securities. With respect to trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the guidance requires that an entity estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance resulting in the net amount expected to be collected to be reflected as the financial asset. Entities will also be required to provide more disclosures, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. This guidance is effective for public business entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2019.\nThe Company completed implementation of the guidance and will adopt it in the first quarter of 2020. As a part of the implementation, the Company reconciled historical loan data, determined segmentation of the loan portfolio for application of the CECL calculation, determined the key assumptions, selected calculation methods, and established an internal controls framework. The Company also used the services of an independent third party advisor to validate the conceptual soundness of the proposed methodology framework and of the CECL model. At the adoption date, exclusive of the reclassification of $2.8 million to the allowance for credit losses of amounts related to the previously acquired impaired loans, the estimated impact to retained earnings at transition date is expected to be approximately $2.0 million based on the expected performance of the economy at the transition date. Future amounts of provision expense will depend on the size and composition of the loan portfolio, future economic conditions and borrower's payment performance.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of the Company's operating revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this discussion and analysis, the interest earned on tax-advantaged loans and tax-exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes. The result is referred to as tax-equivalent interest income and tax-equivalent net interest income. The following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the impact of the acquisition of WashingtonFirst and a review of the information provided in the table that provides yields and rates on average balances.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet interest income for 2019 was $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million for 2018, a 2% increase. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2019 was $270.1 million compared to $265.2 million for 2018. The net interest income growth during the current year from the prior year reflects the effects of the 11 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which grew 5%, which was largely offset by the 32 basis point growth in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Overall, the net interest margin decreased to 3.51% for 2019 compared to 3.60% for 2018. An analysis of the net interest income performance is presented in the following tables. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans compared to $2.4 million for the prior year. Exclusive of these recoveries the net interest margin would have been 3.48% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the amortization of the fair value adjustments in 2019 associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst was estimated to be a 5 basis point positive impact on the net interest margin for 2019, compared to a 13 basis point impact for the prior year.\n\n2018 vs. 2017\nNet interest income for 2018 was $260.4 million compared to $168.8 million for 2017, a 54% increase, due to growth in earning assets coupled with the overall increase in the associated yields on those assets. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nNet income for Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled a record $116.4 million ($3.25 per diluted share) compared to $100.9 million ($2.82 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results from 2019 and 2018 included recovered interest income from previously acquired impaired loans of $1.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The results for 2018 also included the effect of merger expenses totaling $11.8 million (an after tax impact of $0.24 per share), which were associated with the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. ( WashingtonFirst\u201d), compared to $1.3 million for 2019, which are associated with the pending acquisition of Revere Bank that is expected close in the beginning of the second quarter of 2020.\nThese results reflect the impact of following events:\n\uf0b7 Total loans at December 31, 2019 increased 2% compared to December 31, 2018. During this period, the Company experienced 7% growth in total commercial loans as investor real estate loans and owner occupied real estate loans grew by 11% and 7%, respectively. The impact of commercial loan growth was offset by the decline in the mortgage loan portfolio due to the impact of mortgage loan refinance activity driven by the current interest rate environment and the sale of the majority of new mortgage loan production and the decline in consumer loan balances.\n\uf0b7 Total deposits grew 9% compared to the end of 2018. Deposit growth reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 104% at the end of 2019 compared to 111% at the end of 2018. The year-over-year deposit growth included an 8% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, a 13% increase in core interest-bearing deposits and a 38% reduction in wholesale deposits.\n\uf0b7 The net interest margin was 3.51% in 2019, compared to 3.60% in 2018.\n\uf0b7 The provision for loan losses was $4.7 million for 2019 compared to $9.0 million for 2018, reflecting the overall improvement in the qualitative credit metrics of the loan portfolio during the previous twelve months in addition to lower loan growth than experienced in the prior year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest income increased 17% to $71.3 million for 2019, compared to $61.1 million for 2018. Excluding life insurance mortality proceeds of $0.6 million and $1.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, non-interest income increased 19%. This increase was driven by income from mortgage banking activities, which increased 108% from the prior year, to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the rise in mortgage lending activity during the year.\n\uf0b7 Non-interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $179.1 million for 2019 compared to $179.8 million for the prior year. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses compared to $1.3 million for the current year. Excluding merger expenses, non-interest expense rose 6%, driven primarily by increases in salaries and benefits. A portion of the increases in non-interest expense was offset by the significant decrease in FDIC insurance during the year.\n\uf0b7 The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 51.52% for 2019 compared to 50.87% for 2018.\n\uf0b7 During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased 668,191 shares of common stock at an average price of $36.34 per share as part of its existing share repurchase program\n\uf0b7 The Company successfully issued $175 million in subordinated debt in November 2019. The debt will provide capital to support future growth in the real estate lending portfolio and fund anticipated future redemptions of existing higher priced funding sources.\nThe national economy, as well as the Mid-Atlantic region in which the Company operates, continued to exhibit a solid economic performance throughout 2019. Consumer confidence remains high as a result of certain positive economic trends such as reduced lending rates, low unemployment, stable housing prices and solid performance in the financial markets. These positive trends have been tempered by economic concerns over a lack of wage growth, the political environment, trade turmoil and the impact of regional conflict. These factors act to constrain economic activity from time to time on the part of both large and small businesses. Despite the mixed business environment, the Company has experienced consistent growth in focused areas while maintaining strong levels of liquidity, capital and credit quality.\nLiquidity continues to remain strong due to borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve and the size and composition of the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Bank remained above all well-capitalized\u201d regulatory requirement levels. Tangible book value per common share increased by 9% to $22.37 from $20.45 at December 31, 2018. The Company's credit quality remained strong as non-performing assets represented 0.50% of total assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.03% for 2019, compared to 0.01% for the prior year.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 increased 5% compared to December 31, 2018. Total loans at December 31, 2019, were $6.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018. During this period, the composition of the portfolio shifted as total commercial loans grew 7% while mortgage loans declined 8% due to the refinance activity and the strategic decision to sell the majority of new mortgage loan production. Consumer loans experienced a 10% decline related to recent mortgage refinancing activity. During this period, total funded commercial loan production was a record $884 million. Commercial loans originated during the current year had total unfunded commitments of $479 million as of December 31, 2019.\nCustomer funding sources at year end 2019, which include deposits plus other short-term borrowings from core customers, increased 8% compared to year end 2018. The increase in customer funding sources was driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market savings accounts. The Company reduced FHLB borrowings by 39% during the year to assist in the management of the net interest margin. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company issued $175 million in subordinated debt. The proceeds from the debt provides capital for future growth in the real estate lending portfolio, in addition to providing funds to reduce higher priced funding sources.\nStockholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 6% to $1.13 billion as compared to $1.07 billion at December 31, 2018. The growth in stockholders' equity during 2019 was due to net income net of the dividends paid to stockholders. During 2019 the Company repurchased 668,000 shares, resulting in a $24.3 million reduction in stockholders' equity.\nNet interest income increased 2% to $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest margin was 3.51% compared to 3.60% for the prior year. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $1.8 million in recovered interest income on acquired credit impaired loans as compared to $2.4 million in 2018. Excluding these recoveries, the net interest margin would have been 3.48% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amortization of the fair value adjustments for 2019 was estimated to be 5 basis points on an annual basis compared to a 13 basis point impact for the prior year. Compared to the prior year, average interest-earning assets grew 5% with an increase of 11 basis points in the yield while average interest-bearing liabilities grew 3% with an increase of 32 basis points in the rate paid.\nNon-interest income increased 17% in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by the increase in income from mortgage banking activities during 2019, as favorable residential lending rates during the year resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan originations. After excluding merger expenses from both years, non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 6% compared to the prior year due to the increase in compensation costs.\nNet income for 2019 included the effect of merger expenses totaling $1.3 million, which was offset by the $1.8 million in recovered interest income from previously acquired credit impaired loans. The prior year included $11.8 million in merger expenses and $2.4 million of the interest recoveries, which resulted in an after-tax reduction to earnings per share of approximately $0.19 per share for 2018. Pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the merger expenses in both years in addition to the provision for loan losses, increased 4% from 2018 to 2019 to a record $158.9 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value. A decline in the value of assets required to be recorded at fair value may warrant an impairment write-down or valuation allowance to be established. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in greater financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when readily available. Management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results:\n\uf0b7 Allowance for loan losses;\n\uf0b7 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment;\n\uf0b7 Accounting for income taxes;\n\uf0b7 Fair value measurements;\n\uf0b7 Defined benefit pension plan.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Acquired performing loans have their fair values determined at the date of acquisition. A portion of the fair value is determined based on credit quality. Accordingly, those loans are not included in the total loan portfolio when determining the estimated allowance for probable loan losses. The Company monitors the acquired performing loans to ensure that the remaining portion of the acquisition fair value adjustment is equivalent or exceeds the estimated allowance under the Company's allowance methodology. The allowance is based on the basic principle that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of probable losses in the lending portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize probable losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the composition of loans in the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers as a result of changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, and independent consultants engaged by the Company periodically review the loan portfolio and the allowance. Such reviews may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses has two basic components: a general allowance (ASC 450 reserves) reflecting historical losses by loan category, as adjusted by several qualitative factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios, and specific allowances (ASC 310 reserves) for individually identified impaired loans. Each of these components, and the allowance methodology used to establish them, are described in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. The amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the Risk Committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board.\nGeneral allowances are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured over the prior eight quarters and weighted equally. The historical loss experience is supplemented by the inclusion of qualitative risk factors to address various risk characteristics of the Company's loan portfolio including:\n\uf0b7 trends in delinquencies and other non-performing loans;\n\uf0b7 changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio;\n\uf0b7 changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio;\n\uf0b7 concentrations of loans to specific industry segments;\n\uf0b7 changes in economic conditions on both a local, regional and national level;\n\uf0b7 changes in the Company's credit administration and loan portfolio management processes; and\n\uf0b7 quality of the Company's credit risk identification processes.\nThe general allowance comprised 90% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The general allowance is calculated in two parts based on an internal risk classification of loans within each portfolio segment. Allowances on loans considered to be criticized\u201d and classified\u201d under regulatory guidance are calculated separately from loans considered to be pass\u201d rated under the same guidance. This segregation allows the Company to monitor the allowance applicable to higher risk loans separate from the remainder of the portfolio in order to better manage risk and ensure the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe portion of the allowance representing specific allowances is established on individually impaired loans. As a practical expedient, for collateral dependent loans, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell the underlying collateral. For loans on which the Company has not elected to use a practical expedient to measure impairment, the Company will measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. In determining the cash flows to be included in the discount calculation the Company considers the following factors that combine to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses:\n\uf0b7 the borrower's overall financial condition;\n\uf0b7 resources and payment record;\n\uf0b7 demonstrated or documented support available from financial guarantors; and\n\uf0b7 the adequacy of collateral value and the ultimate realization of that value at liquidation.\nThe specific allowance accounted for 10% of the total allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated losses on impaired loans can differ substantially from actual losses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment assessment requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of recorded goodwill is required. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write-down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value. The Company assesses for impairment of goodwill as of October 1 of each year using September 30 data and again at any quarter-end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in future operating results, adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the Company to use a degree of subjectivity.\nUnder current accounting guidance, the Company has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment of these qualitative factors, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than the carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment process, previously required, is unnecessary. However, if it appears that the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on the qualitative assessment, the first step of the two-step process must be performed. The Company has elected this accounting guidance with respect to its Community Banking, Investment Management and Insurance segments. At December 31, 2019 there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles in any of the Company's reporting units.\nOther intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Examples of such assets include core deposit intangibles, acquired customer lists and other identifiable intangibles. Other intangible assets have finite lives and are reviewed for impairment annually. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line or sum-of-the-years basis over varying periods that initially did not exceed 15 years.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available-for-sale, residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements. Loans where it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis.\nThe Company conducts a quarterly review for all investment securities that have potential impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. Valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, valuations are based on pricing models, quotes for similar investment securities, and, where necessary, an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows. In addition, the Company considers the financial condition of the issuer, the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nThe above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in Note 22-Fair Value\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nThe Company has a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. The plan was frozen for existing entrants after December 31, 2007 and all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of December 31, 2007 based on past service. Future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur.\nSeveral factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan, including (1) the size and characteristics of the plan population, (2) the discount rate, (3) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and (4) other actuarial assumptions. Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and the terms of the plan. As a result of the plan freeze, the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date, which is December 31 of each year. The discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy. Should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns, this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, in March 2017. This guidance is intended to eliminate the current diversity in practice with respect to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under current GAAP, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of yield over the contractual life. As a result, upon the exercise of a call on a callable debt security held at a premium, the unamortized premium is recorded as a loss in earnings. The amendments in this update shorten the amortization period for such callable debt securities held at a premium requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer for its fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, in January 2017. The objective of this guidance is to simplify an entity's required test for impairment of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In Step 2 an entity measured a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill, an entity had to determine the fair value at the impairment date of its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized assets and liabilities, following a procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under this Update, an entity should perform its annual or quarterly goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the reporting unit's fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit and the entity must consider the income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This guidance is effective for a public business entity that is an SEC filer for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FASB issued Update No. 2016-13, Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL), in June 2016. This guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. Under the new guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This will result in earlier recognition of loss allowances in most instances. Credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities (regardless of whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary) will be measured in a manner similar to the present, except that such losses will be recorded as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the related securities. With respect to trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the guidance requires that an entity estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance resulting in the net amount expected to be collected to be reflected as the financial asset. Entities will also be required to provide more disclosures, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. This guidance is effective for public business entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2019.\nThe Company completed implementation of the guidance and will adopt it in the first quarter of 2020. As a part of the implementation, the Company reconciled historical loan data, determined segmentation of the loan portfolio for application of the CECL calculation, determined the key assumptions, selected calculation methods, and established an internal controls framework. The Company also used the services of an independent third party advisor to validate the conceptual soundness of the proposed methodology framework and of the CECL model. At the adoption date, exclusive of the reclassification of $2.8 million to the allowance for credit losses of amounts related to the previously acquired impaired loans, the estimated impact to retained earnings at transition date is expected to be approximately $2.0 million based on the expected performance of the economy at the transition date. Future amounts of provision expense will depend on the size and composition of the loan portfolio, future economic conditions and borrower's payment performance.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest source of the Company's operating revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this discussion and analysis, the interest earned on tax-advantaged loans and tax-exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes. The result is referred to as tax-equivalent interest income and tax-equivalent net interest income. The following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the impact of the acquisition of WashingtonFirst and a review of the information provided in the table that provides yields and rates on average balances.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet interest income for 2019 was $265.3 million compared to $260.4 million for 2018, a 2% increase. On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2019 was $270.1 million compared to $265.2 million for 2018. The net interest income growth during the current year from the prior year reflects the effects of the 11 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which grew 5%, which was largely offset by the 32 basis point growth in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Overall, the net interest margin decreased to 3.51% for 2019 compared to 3.60% for 2018. An analysis of the net interest income performance is presented in the following tables.
