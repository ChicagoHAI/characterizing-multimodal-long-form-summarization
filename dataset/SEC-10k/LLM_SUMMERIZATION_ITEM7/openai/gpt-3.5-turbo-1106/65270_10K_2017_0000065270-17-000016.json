Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing, design and testing facilities in China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our primary manufacturing locations are located in Shanghai, China; Cairo, Egypt; Mriehel, Malta; and Monterrey, Mexico. We design, manufacture and market devices employing electrical, radio remote control, electronic, wireless and sensing technologies. Our business is managed on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Interface, Power Products and Other. For more information regarding the business and products of these segments, see Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOur components are found in the primary end-markets of the aerospace, appliance, automotive, construction, consumer and industrial equipment, communications (including information processing and storage, networking equipment, wireless and terrestrial voice/data systems), medical device, rail and other transportation industries.\nPlan to Repurchase Common Stock\nIn September 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock through September 1, 2017. The Company purchased 280,168 shares of outstanding common stock for $9.8 million in fiscal 2017 and 1,997,298 shares for $62.3 million in fiscal 2016. In total, the Company has purchased 2,277,466 shares of outstanding common stock for $72.1 million under the plan. The program may be suspended or terminated at any time.\nHetronic Germany-GmbH Matters\nFor several years, Hetronic Germany-GmbH and Hydronic-Steuersysteme-GmbH (the Fuchs companies\u201d) served as our distributors for Germany, Austria and other central and eastern European countries pursuant to their respective intellectual property licenses and distribution and assembly agreements. We became aware that the Fuchs companies and their managing director, Albert Fuchs, had materially violated those agreements. As a result, we terminated all of our agreements with the Fuchs companies. On June 20, 2014, we filed a lawsuit against the Fuchs companies in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging material breaches of the distribution and assembly agreements and seeking damages, as well as various forms of injunctive relief. The defendants have filed counterclaims alleging breach of contract, interference with business relations and business slander, and an affiliated company has filed a suit in front of the European Union Intellectual Property Office seeking to invalidate the company's NOVA trademark in the EU. On April 2, 2015, we amended our complaint against the Fuchs companies to add additional unfair competition and Lanham Act claims and to add additional affiliated parties. As of April 29, 2017, the matter remains in the discovery stage.\nWe incurred legal fees of $11.0 million, $9.9 million and $3.1 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, related to the lawsuits. These amounts are included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Interface segment.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2017, as Compared to

The Power Products segment's net sales increased $2.8 million, or 5.2%, to $56.3 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $53.5 million for fiscal 2016. Translation of foreign operations' net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased net sales by $5.5 million, or 0.7%, compared to the average currency rates in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Chinese yuan and the euro.\nCost of Products Sold. Consolidated cost of products sold increased $2.0 million, or 0.3%, to $598.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $596.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 73.3% for fiscal 2017, compared to 73.7% for fiscal 2016. The Automotive, Interface and Power Products segments were all favorably impacted by commodity pricing of raw materials and a favorable currency impact on material purchases and labor costs. The Automotive segment was favorably impacted by both\ncommodity pricing adjustments of $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues resolved in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2017 cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by $2.2 million due to exit costs for our Connectivity and Active Energy Solutions reporting units. Both businesses were shuttered due to market conditions. The Power Products segment experienced favorable change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales, primarily due to implemented overhead cost reductions in the U.S. and China. In fiscal 2016, the Interface segment experienced additional costs of $1.0 million, as well as inefficiencies, related to the move of the radio remote control operation from the Philippines to Egypt.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit increased $5.4 million, or 2.5%, to $218.3 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, as compared to $212.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.

The Automotive segment was favorably impacted by both commodity pricing adjustments of $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues resolved in fiscal 2017. The Automotive, Interface and Power Products segments were all favorably impacted by commodity pricing of raw materials and a favorable currency impact on material purchases and labor costs. The Power Products segment experienced favorable gross margins as a percentage of sales primarily due to implemented overhead cost reductions in the U.S. and China. The fiscal 2017 gross margins were negatively impacted by exit costs related to the closure of our Connectivity and Active Energy Solutions reporting units. In fiscal 2016, the Interface segment experienced additional costs of $1.0 million, as well as inefficiencies, related to the move of the radio remote control operation from the Philippines to Egypt.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $4.4 million, or 4.4%, to $105.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $100.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, from 12.5% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. In fiscal 2017, expenses increased for stock award amortization expenses by $5.0 million, legal and other professional fees by $1.6 million and fees related to acquisition activity, primarily for a potential acquisition we elected not to undertake, by $1.5 million, partially offset by selling and fringe related expenses of $2.3 million and lower travel expenses of $1.5 million.\nInterest Income, Net. Interest income, net decreased $0.3 million, to $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to increased average debt levels during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net increased $4.2 million to $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Fiscal 2017 includes $4.5 million for an international government grant for maintaining certain employment levels during the period. All other amounts for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 relate to currency rate fluctuations. The functional currencies of these operations are the British pound, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc. Some foreign operations have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, primarily sales in U.S. dollars and euros, creating exchange rate sensitivities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased $3.3 million, or 12.5%, to $23.0 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $26.3 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 19.9% in fiscal 2017, compared to 23.8% in fiscal 2016. The results for fiscal 2017 include a tax benefit of $4.0 million for foreign investment tax credits, partially offset by a tax expense of $1.7 million on a dividend between foreign entities\nNet Income Attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc. Net income attributable to Methode Electronics, Inc. increased $8.3 million, or 9.8%, to $92.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $84.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of commodity pricing adjustments and resolved customer commercial issues, favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and the favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs in our foreign operations, an international government grant, lower travel expenses and lower tax expenses. Net income was unfavorably impacted by higher stock award amortization expense, exit costs, increased legal, acquisitions related expenses and professional fees.\nOperating Segments\nAutomotive Segment Results\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>632.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>449.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>182.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of sales:\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>71.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margins\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Net sales increased in North America by $28.5 million, or 8.4%, to $369.4 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $340.9 million for fiscal 2016. Sales volumes increased for our GM Center Console program (with the launch of new platforms in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016), user interface assemblies, and for transmission lead-frame assemblies. Sales volumes decreased $2.3 million for the Ford Center Console program. North American sales were negatively impacted by pricing concessions on certain products. Net sales decreased in Europe by $7.8 million, or 4.9%, to $151.9 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $159.7 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower sales volumes of ignition switch products and decreased sales of customer funded tooling and design and development services. Europe experienced higher sales volumes of certain Integrated Center Panels and steering wheel switch products. Net sales in Asia decreased $2.8 million, or 2.5%, to $110.9 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $113.7 million in fiscal 2016. The Asian sales were negatively impacted by $3.7 million due to the strengthening of the U.S dollar as compared to the Chinese yuan. Sales volumes increased for linear position sensor products and transmission lead-frame assemblies, partially offset by lower sales volumes of steering-angle sensor products. Translation of foreign operations' total Automotive net sales for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017 decreased by $5.5 million, or 0.9%, in fiscal 2017, compared to the average currency rates in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the Chinese yuan.\nCost of Products Sold. Automotive segment cost of products sold increased $5.8 million, or 1.3%, to $449.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, from $443.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The Automotive segment cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 71.1% in fiscal 2017, compared to 72.2% in fiscal 2016. The results for fiscal 2017 include $1.0 million of commodity pricing adjustments and the reversal of accruals of $1.0 million related to resolved customer commercial issues. In addition, the decrease is due to favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and the favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs, primarily in Mexico and China. Fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by $1.3 million due to a refund of import duties from prior periods.\nGross Profit. Automotive segment gross profit increased $12.1 million, or 7.1%, to $182.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, as compared to $170.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.

The increase in expenses in fiscal 2017 is primarily due to higher stock award amortization expense, partially offset with lower bonus, commission and travel expenses.\nIncome from Operations. Automotive segment income from operations increased $11.5 million, or 8.4%, to $148.3 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $136.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Income from operations increased in fiscal 2017 due to increased sales volumes, commodity pricing adjustments and a one-time reversal of accruals related to resolved customer commercial issues, favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and the favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs in our foreign operations and lower bonus and travel expenses. Income from operations was negatively impacted in fiscal 2017 due to higher stock award amortization expenses.\nInterface Segment Results\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>100.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income/(loss) from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(133.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of sales:\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>79.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margins\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income/(loss) from operations\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Net sales decreased in North America by $12.8 million, or 11.5%, to $98.1 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $110.9 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower sales volumes of data solutions and appliance products. In addition, North American sales are down due to pricing concessions for certain data solutions products. Net sales in Europe decreased $0.5 million, or 1.9%, to $25.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $26.3 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower sales volumes of our data solutions products. Net sales in Asia decreased $0.1 million, or 2.8%, to $3.5 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $3.6 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to slightly lower sales volumes of legacy products.\nCost of Products Sold. Interface segment cost of products sold decreased $7.1 million, or 6.6%, to $100.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $107.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Interface segment cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales increased to 79.1% for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to 76.6% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to lower sales volumes, specifically data solutions products. Cost of products sold for fiscal 2017 includes exit costs of $1.1 million for our Connectivity reporting unit. The business was shuttered at the end of fiscal 2017 due to market conditions. The fiscal 2017 cost of goods sold was favorably impacted due to favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and a favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs, primarily in Mexico. Fiscal 2016 was unfavorably impacted due to additional costs and inefficiencies experienced related to the move of the radio remote control operation from the Philippines to Egypt. The\nCompany experienced moving costs, severance and redundant staffing of $1.0 million in addition to the manufacturing inefficiencies.\nGross Profit. Interface segment gross profit decreased $6.3 million, or 19.1%, to $26.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $32.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased to 20.9% for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, from 23.4% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volumes, specifically data solutions products. Gross profit was also negatively impacted by $1.1 million of exit costs. Gross profit was favorably impacted due to commodity pricing of raw materials and a favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs in our foreign operations, primarily in Mexico. Fiscal 2016 was unfavorably impacted due to moving costs, severance and redundant staffing related to the move from the Philippines to Egypt.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 8.9%, to $27.5 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to $30.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 21.6% for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, from 21.4% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower compensation, travel and advertising expenses, partially offset by increased legal fees and stock award amortization expenses.\nIncome/(loss) from Operations. Interface segment income/(loss) from operations decreased $3.6 million, or 133.3%, to a loss of $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2017, compared to income of $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, primarily due to lower sales volumes, exit costs, higher legal fees and higher stock award amortization expense, partially offset with favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and the currency impact of labor related expenses, lower compensation related expenses, lower travel expenses and lower advertising expenses.\nPower Products Segment Results\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of sales:\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>73.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margins\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Consolidated net sales decreased $72.0 million, or 8.2%, to $809.1 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, from $881.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The Automotive segment net sales decreased $14.1\nmillion, or 2.2%, to $614.3 million for fiscal 2016, from $628.4 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes of the Ford Center Console program which substantially completed production at the end of fiscal 2015, unfavorable currency rate fluctuations and higher pricing concessions on certain products, partially offset by increased sales volumes for the GM Center Console program. The Interface segment net sales decreased $20.9 million, or 12.9%, to $140.8 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $161.7 million for fiscal 2015, due to lower sales volumes of appliance and data solutions products, partially offset by increased sales volumes of radio remote control products. The Power Products segment net sales decreased $32.2 million, or 37.6%, to $53.5 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $85.7 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes for PowerRail, cabling and busbar products. The Power Products net sales for fiscal 2016 include a gain on the sale of a building of $1.0 million and $1.5 million of customer contractual adjustments for minimum purchases. The Other segment had minimal sales for fiscal 2016 as the Company sold its Trace Laboratories operating units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the remaining operating units in this segment, medical devices, inverters and battery systems, had minimal net sales for fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015. Translation of foreign operations net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 decreased net sales by $10.5 million, or 1.3%, compared to the average currency rates for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, compared to the euro and Chinese yuan.\nCost of Products Sold. Consolidated cost of products sold decreased $66.1 million, or 10.0%, to $596.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $662.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. Consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 73.7% for fiscal 2016, compared to 75.2% for fiscal 2015. The Automotive segment experienced a decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales substantially due to favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and favorable currency impact on both the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs in our foreign operations. The Automotive segment cost of goods sold for fiscal 2016 includes a one-time reversal of accruals of $2.1 million related to customer commercial issues. The Interface segment experienced an increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales primarily due to costs and inefficiencies experienced during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the move of the radio remote control operation from the Philippines to Egypt. The Company experienced moving costs and severance and redundant staffing costs of $1.0 million in fiscal 2016 in addition to the manufacturing inefficiencies. The increase in the Interface segment was also due to lower sales volumes for appliance and data solutions products. The Power Products segment experienced an increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales primarily due to decreased sales volumes.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit decreased $5.9 million, or 2.7%, to $212.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as compared to $218.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.3% for fiscal 2016, compared to 24.8% for fiscal 2015. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, favorable commodity pricing and the favorable currency impact on the purchase of certain raw materials and labor costs in our foreign operations in the Automotive segment was partially offset by higher pricing concessions on certain products in the Automotive segment and decreased sales volumes for the Interface and Power Products segments and additional costs and inefficiencies experienced during fiscal 2016 related to the move of the radio remote control operation from the Philippines to Egypt. Gross profit for fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of a building, the one-time reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues and customer contractual adjustments for minimum purchases.\nImpairment of Goodwill.

Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% for fiscal 2016 from 10.7% for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, expenses increased for legal and other professional fees by $8.9 million, wages, benefits and stock award compensation expense by $4.4 million, selling and other general expenses of $2.5 million, partially offset by decreased long-term incentive bonus expense of $9.0 million.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased $0.9 million, or 60.0%, to $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The increase relates to the Company shortening the estimated useful lives of some specific patents due to business conditions at the end of fiscal 2015.\nGain on the Sale of Business. During fiscal 2015, we sold our 100% ownership interest in our Trace Laboratories businesses for $11.7 million. The net assets of the businesses had a book value of $4.0 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $7.7 million, related to the sale of the net assets.\nInterest Income, Net.

Interface segment income from operations decreased $4.3 million, or 61.4%, to $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $7.0 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes, increased legal expenses, move and inefficiency expenses related to the move of the radio remote control operation, intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset with no impairment charges.\nPower Products Segment Results\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of sales:\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margins\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Power Products segment net sales decreased $32.2 million, or 37.6%, to $53.5 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $85.7 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. Net sales decreased in North America by $24.5 million, or 47.8%, to $26.8 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $51.3 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes of PowerRail products. Included in the North American net sales for fiscal 2016 is a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a building. Net sales in Europe decreased $3.7 million, or 33.0%, to $7.5 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $11.2 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes of a bypass switch. Included in the European net sales for fiscal 2016 is a $1.5 million customer contractual adjustment for minimum purchases. Net sales in Asia decreased $4.0 million, or 17.2%, to $19.2 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $23.2 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to decreased sales volumes of busbar and cabling products.\nCost of Products Sold. Power Products segment cost of products sold decreased $17.4 million, or 30.1%, to $40.5 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $57.9 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The Power Products segment cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales increased to 75.7% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, from 67.6% for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to decreased sales volumes.\nGross Profit. Power Products segment gross profit decreased $14.8 million, or 53.2%, to $13.0 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $27.8 million for fiscal 2015. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24.3% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 from 32.4% for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The decrease in gross margins as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to decreased sales volumes. Gross profit was favorably impacted by the gain on a sale of a building and customer contractual adjustments for minimum purchases.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 21.7%, to $3.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $4.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower commission and bonus expense in North America. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.7% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 from 5.4% for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes.\nIncome From Operations. Power Products segment income from operations decreased $13.8 million, or 59.5%, to $9.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $23.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015, due to decreased sales volumes, partially offset with a gain on the sale of a building, customer contractual adjustments for minimum purchases, lower commission and bonus expense.\nOther Segment Results\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of sales:\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>1,433.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margins\n</td> <td>(1,333.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>1,600.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(2,933.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*N/M equals non meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. The Other segment net sales decreased $4.9 million, or 94.2%, to minimal sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Trace Laboratories business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The remaining operating units in this segment, medical devices, inverters and battery systems, had minimal net sales for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nCost of Products Sold. Other segment cost of products sold decreased $2.7 million, or 38.6%, to $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $7.0 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Trace Laboratories, partially offset with development costs in our medical devices, inverters and battery systems operating units.\nGross Profit. The Other segment gross profit decreased $2.2 million, to a loss of $4.0 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to a loss of $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Trace Laboratories, partially offset with development costs in our medical devices, inverters and battery systems operating units.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, or 4.3%, to $4.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $4.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased headcount and professional fees in our medical devices, inverters and battery systems operating units, partially offset by the sale of Trace Laboratories businesses.\nLoss From Operations The Other segment loss from operations increased $2.4 million to $8.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, compared to $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015. The increased loss was primarily due to the sale of Trace Laboratories business, increased development expenses, professional fees and headcount.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe our current world-wide cash balances, together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations and our committed credit facility, will be sufficient to support current operations. A significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S. Of the $294.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of April 29, 2017, $292.1 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. Our foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and therefore not available to fund our domestic operations. We currently have minimal federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. to reduce the cash tax obligation upon any future repatriation of funds.\nOn November 18, 2016, the Company replaced its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a new Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as L/C Issuer, and the Lenders named therein (the Credit Agreement\u201d). In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 25, 2011 by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions was terminated.\nThe Credit Agreement has a maturity date of November 18, 2021. The credit facility is in the maximum principal amount of $150.0 million, with an option to increase the principal amount by up to an additional $100.0 million, subject to customary conditions and approval of the lender(s) providing new commitment(s). The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions.\nThe credit facility provides for variable rates of interest based on the type of borrowing and the Company's debt to EBITDA financial ratio. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, financial covenants, restrictive covenants and events of default.\nAt April 29, 2017, the interest rate on the credit facility was 1.25% plus LIBOR. At April 29, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants of the agreement. During fiscal 2017, we had no borrowings and made payments of $31.1 million, which included interest of $1.1 million under this credit facility. As of April 29, 2017, there were outstanding balances against the credit facility of $27.0 million. There was $123.0 million available to borrow under the credit facility as of April 29, 2017, which does not include the option to increase the principal amount. We believe the fair value approximates the carrying amount as of April 29, 2017.\nOperating cash flow is summarized below (in millions):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>April 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash items\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $34.5 million to $145.2 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $110.7 million for fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher net income, the changes in deferred income taxes and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net changes in assets and liabilities resulted in the decreased cash use of $32.0 million, to cash provided of $19.3 million in fiscal 2017, compared to cash use of $12.7 million in fiscal 2016. The decreased cash use in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily driven by lower inventory balances and the timing of payments to suppliers.\nOperating Activities - Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $12.2 million to $110.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $122.9 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower net income, decreased cash use from deferred income taxes and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net changes in assets and liabilities resulted in the increased cash use of $3.8 million, to $12.7 million in fiscal 2016, compared to cash use of $8.9 million in fiscal 2015. The increased cash use in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily driven by the payment of bonuses and the timing of receivable collections, partially offset with a decrease in inventory levels.\nInvesting Activities - Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $0.1 million, to $21.7 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $21.6 million in fiscal 2016. Purchases of property, plant and equipment decreased by $0.8 million, to $22.4 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $23.2 million in fiscal 2016. Purchases for both periods primarily relate to equipment purchases for new product launches and the replacement of some older equipment. We sold buildings for $0.7 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.\nInvesting Activities - Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $10.3 million, to $21.6 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $11.3 million in fiscal 2015. Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by $0.7 million, to $23.2 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $22.5 million in fiscal 2015. Purchases for both periods primarily relate to equipment purchases for new product launches. In fiscal 2016, we sold a building for $1.6 million. In addition, fiscal 2016 included a $1.1 million escrow payment related to the sale of our investment in Lumidigm. In fiscal 2015, we sold our interest in our Trace Laboratories businesses for $11.7 million. We received $11.2 million related to the sale, with the remaining $0.5 million held in escrow. The escrow amount was paid in fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Activities - Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $18.3 million to $47.0 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $28.7 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, the Company had net repayments against the credit facility of $30.0 million and in fiscal 2016, the Company had net borrowings of $52.0 million. We paid dividends of $13.7 million and $13.5 million, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. In September 2015, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding stock through September 1, 2017. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased shares worth $9.8 and $62.3 million, respectively, under the plan. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 includes $1.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. There were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.7 million in fiscal 2017 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 includes $4.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of excess tax benefit on equity shares issued and stock options exercised during those periods.\nFinancing Activities - Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash used by financing activities decreased $19.8 million to $28.7 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $48.5 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, the Company had net proceeds against the credit facility of $52.0 million and in fiscal 2015, the Company had net repayment of borrowings of $43.0 million. We paid dividends of $13.5 million and $13.8 million, in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. During fiscal 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock through September 1, 2017. In fiscal 2016, the Company purchased $62.3 million, which includes $0.3 million in commissions, pursuant to the plan. Fiscal 2016 includes $7.7 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $2.2 million of excess tax benefit on those shares as well as on stock options exercised during the fiscal year. There were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.6 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $4.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments, as of April 29, 2017 (in millions):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than the operating leases and purchase obligations noted in the preceding table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on product sales when (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) the price is fixed or determinable, (iii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and (iv) collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured. Revenue from our product sales not requiring installation, net of trade discounts and estimated sales allowances, is recognized when title passes, which is generally upon shipment. We do not have any additional obligations or customer acceptance provisions after shipment of such products. We handle returns by replacing, repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned. The Company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction between the Company and the Company's customers. These taxes may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. The Company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts, information about the creditworthiness of customers, and other relevant information. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each reporting period, and changes are recorded in the period they become known. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nOur revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers within the automotive industry. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment of the automotive industry, in general, could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results, and additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required.\nAllowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowances are based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales, using assumptions about future product life cycles, product demand and market conditions. If actual product life cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us, inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board,\n(\"FASB\"), Accounting Standards Codification, (\"ASC\"), Topic 350 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test.\nWe evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, we evaluate goodwill using a two-step impairment test. Otherwise, we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the two-step impairment test.\nOur qualitative screen includes an assessment of certain factors including, but not limited to, the results of prior year value calculations, the movement of our share price and market capitalization, the reporting unit and overall financial performance, and macroeconomic and industry conditions. After considering qualitative factors and other evidence obtained, we determine if it is more likely than not whether the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount. Although we believe the factors considered in the impairment analysis are reasonable, significant changes in any one of the assumptions used could produce a different result. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we were to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we would perform a two-step impairment test (a quantitative analysis). We may also elect to proceed directly to the two-step impairment analysis without considering such qualitative factors.\nIn the first step of the two-step impairment test, fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology (specifically, the income and market approach). The determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long-range forecasts and requires assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels, and other market participant assumptions. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions, and the profitability assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures. Long-range forecasting involves uncertainty which increases with each successive period. Key assumptions, such as revenue growth rates and profitability, especially in the outer years, involve a greater degree of uncertainty.\nWe perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles as of the first day of the fourth quarter and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\nIncome Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The process involves determining actual current tax expense, along with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.\nThe tax laws of Malta provide for investment tax credits of 30% of certain qualified expenditures. Unused credits were $17.9 million as of April 29, 2017, of which $16.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $1.9 million expires in 2020.\nContingencies. We are subject to various investigations, claims and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. For those matters that we can estimate a range of loss, we have established reserves at levels within that range to provide for the most likely scenario based upon available information. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that the Company is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate, changes in the future could impact these determinations.", "summary": "The report presents the financial performance and operations of a global manufacturing company with segments in Automotive, Interface, Power Products, and Other.
