Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Results attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to consolidated results and are not separately presented or discussed below.\nThe following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, along with Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the Safe Harbor\u201d Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 at the beginning of this report, for information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward-looking statements.\nOur operating results for 2020 discussed below were impacted by the economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on crude oil demand and prices and may not be indicative of future results. Given the economic uncertainty from the pandemic and ongoing volatility in commodity prices, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic or other factors will have on the Company's performance in 2021 and beyond.\nOverview\nWe are an independent crude oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. We derive the majority of our operating income and cash flows from the sale of crude oil and natural gas and expect this to continue in the future. Our operations are primarily focused on exploration and development activities in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana and the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLR\u201d and our corporate internet website is www.clr.com.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nCrude oil prices decreased to historically low levels in April 2020 due primarily to reduced global and domestic demand for crude oil caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in consumer behavior and restrictions implemented by governments to mitigate the pandemic. In response to the significant reduction in crude oil prices, we began voluntarily curtailing our production in April 2020 and ultimately curtailed approximately 55% of our operated crude oil production and associated natural gas in the 2020 second quarter. Additionally, in light of the challenges facing our business and industry, we implemented cost saving initiatives and significantly reduced our operated rig and completion crew counts in order to preserve our assets and better align our capital spending with expected available cash flows, resulting in a $1.5 billion, or 56%, decrease in our non-acquisition capital spending in 2020 compared to 2019. These actions, coupled with historically low crude oil prices, resulted in a material reduction in our production, revenues, and cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019.\nCrude oil prices began to stabilize in mid-2020 and generally improved in the second half of 2020 in response to the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of economic activity, and the resulting increase in crude oil demand. In July 2020 we began to gradually restore our curtailed production and subsequently brought our remaining curtailed production back online in September 2020. As a result of our resumed production, coupled with strategic well completion activities in late 2020, our total average production improved to 339,307 Boe per day for the 2020 fourth quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020, yet still remaining 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDespite the gradual improvement in crude oil prices in the second half of 2020, we continued our commitment to operating in a disciplined, capital efficient manner. Improved revenues from higher commodity prices coupled with our tempered spending resulted in the generation of cash flows in excess of operating and capital needs in the second half of 2020 that allowed for a $210 million net reduction in our total debt at December 31, 2020 compared to June 30, 2020. Additionally, despite production curtailments during the year, we continued to drive our per-unit production expenses lower to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019.\nWe remain committed to the responsible stewardship of our assets and continue to focus on maximizing cash flows, further reducing debt, delivering low-cost capital efficient operations, and generating shareholder value. The depth and quality of our asset base, the commodity optionality provided by our significant amount of acreage held by production, and our financial strength allow us to be adaptable in a variety of price environments. We remain flexible as we monitor and adapt to market conditions. See the subsequent section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion of our financial condition.\nFinancial and Operating Metrics\nThe following table contains financial and operating highlights for the periods presented.

or 37%, decrease in STACK oil production due to the previously described production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities undertaken in response to the adverse commodity price environment during the year. These decreases were partially offset by a 906 MBbls, or 8%, increase in crude oil production in SCOOP due to new well completions over the past year in our oil-weighted Project SpringBoard, which exceeded the impact of production curtailments in the play.\nOur production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities in 2020 also impacted our natural gas production, leading to a 28,202 MMcf, or 29%, decrease in STACK natural gas production and a 1,501 MMcf, or 1%, decrease in Bakken natural gas production in 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were partially offset by a 24,974 MMcf, or 22%, increase in SCOOP natural gas production in conjunction with the previously described increase in SCOOP crude oil production in 2020.\nWe have a deep inventory of both oil and gas assets that allow us to be responsive to changes in oil and gas commodity price fundamentals. In the second quarter of 2020 we strategically shifted our rigs to gas-weighted areas in Oklahoma to capitalize on improvements in market prices for natural gas. These actions contributed to an increase in our natural gas production as a percentage of total production from 42% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 and an increase in our South region production as a percentage of total production from 40% in 2019 to 45% in 2020.\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of sales of crude oil and natural gas, gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments, and revenues associated with crude oil and natural gas service operations.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales and related net sales prices presented below are non-GAAP measures. See the subsequent section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for discussion and calculation of these measures.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales. Net crude oil and natural gas sales for 2020 totaled $2.36 billion, a 45% decrease compared to net sales of $4.29 billion for 2019 due to significant decreases in net sales prices and sales volumes as discussed below.\nTotal sales volumes for 2020 decreased 14,232 MBoe, or 11%, compared to 2019, reflecting reduced sales from the previously described production curtailments in the current year. For 2020, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 18% compared to 2019, while our natural gas sales volumes decreased 2%.\nOur crude oil net sales prices averaged $34.71 per barrel for 2020, a decrease of 33% compared to $51.82 per barrel for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and wider price differentials. The differential between NYMEX West Texas Intermediate calendar month crude oil prices and our realized crude oil net sales prices averaged $5.80 per barrel in 2020 compared to $5.15 per barrel in 2019. The increased differential reflects changes in supply and demand fundamentals and economic effects from COVID-19 that impacted location differentials and price realizations in the first and second quarters of 2020 compared to the prior year. Our crude oil net sales price differential to NYMEX averaged $5.20 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur natural gas net sales prices averaged $1.04 per Mcf for 2020, a 41% decrease compared to $1.77 per Mcf for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and lower price realizations. The discount between our net sales prices and NYMEX Henry Hub calendar month natural gas prices weakened to $1.10 per Mcf for 2020 compared to $0.86 per Mcf for 2019. We sell the majority of our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur. The field markets are impacted by residue gas and natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") prices at secondary, downstream markets. NGL prices decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 levels in conjunction with decreased crude oil prices and other factors, resulting in reduced price realizations for our natural gas sales stream relative to benchmark prices. As a result of the decrease in prices, under certain of our arrangements on operated properties the contractual pricing adjustments applied by midstream customers exceeded the sales consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the customers. Additionally, in some instances on non-operated properties the costs incurred by the outside operator exceeded the consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the outside operator. The net amounts paid or payable under these arrangements on operated and non-operated properties totaled $42.9 million for 2020, and are reflected as a reduction of natural gas revenues and net sales prices. Nearly all of such amounts were associated with our North region natural gas production.\nDerivatives. Changes in market prices during 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives, which resulted in negative revenue adjustments of $14.7 million for the year, representing $28.2 million of cash losses partially offset by $13.5 million of unsettled non-cash gains. For 2019, we recognized positive revenue adjustments of $49.1 million resulting from changes in market prices that had a favorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives.\nCrude oil and natural gas service operations. Our crude oil and natural gas service operations consist primarily of revenues associated with water gathering, recycling, and disposal activities, which are impacted by our production volumes and the timing and extent of our drilling and completion projects. Revenues associated with such activities decreased $22.8 million, or 33%, from $68.5 million for 2019 to $45.7 million for 2020 due to reduced water handling activities resulting from our curtailment of production and reduced completion activities during the year. The decreased activities also resulted in a reduction in service-related expenses compared to the prior period.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nProduction expenses. Production expenses decreased $85.3 million, or 19%, to $359.3 million for 2020 compared to $444.6 million for 2019. This decrease resulted from reduced service costs being incurred in conjunction with production curtailments and cost control efforts, operating efficiency gains, and a higher portion of our production coming from wells in Oklahoma which typically have lower operating costs compared to wells in the Bakken, all of which led to a reduction in our production expenses to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019. Despite our production curtailments, we achieved sequential reductions in our per-Boe production expenses each quarter during 2020 and, as a result of our efficient operations and low-cost production growth in Oklahoma late in the year, our production expenses decreased to a notably low $2.80 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter.\nProduction taxes. Production taxes decreased $165.3 million, or 46%, to $192.7 million for 2020 compared to $358.0 million for 2019 due to a 43% decrease in crude oil and natural gas sales. Our production taxes as a percentage of net crude oil and natural gas sales averaged 8.2% for 2020, consistent with 8.3% for 2019.\nExploration expenses. Exploration expenses, which consist primarily of exploratory geological and geophysical costs and dry hole costs that are expensed as incurred, increased $3.0 million, or 21%, to $17.7 million for 2020 compared to $14.7 million for 2019 due to changes in the timing and extent of our exploration-related activities. The 2020 period includes $6.3 million of dry hole costs recognized in the first quarter associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well with no comparable dry hole costs incurred in 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d). Total DD&A decreased $136.4 million, or 7%, to $1.88 billion for 2020 compared to $2.02 billion for 2019 due to an 11% decrease in total sales volumes, the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in our DD&A rate per Boe as further discussed below. The following table shows the components of our DD&A on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$/Boe </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.03 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated proved reserves are a key component in our computation of DD&A expense. Proved reserves are determined using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months as required by SEC rules. Holding all other factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward due to commodity price declines or other reasons, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases. Conversely, if proved reserves are revised upward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense decreases.\nDownward revisions of proved reserves at year-end 2020 prompted by the significant decrease in average commodity prices and other factors resulted in an increase in our DD&A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties compared to 2019. As a result of these downward revisions, our DD&A increased to $19.01 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $16.45 per Boe for the 2019 fourth quarter, which contributed to the overall increase in our DD&A rate for the full year of 2020.\nNYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021 averaged $51.04 per barrel and $2.53 per MMBtu, respectively, which are notably higher than average prices in 2020. If commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period, upward price-related revisions of proved reserves may occur in the future, which may be significant and could result in a decrease in our DD&A rate relative to the 2020 fourth quarter. We are unable to predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on our future DD&A rate.\nProperty impairments. Property impairments increased $191.7 million to $277.9 million for 2020 compared to $86.2 million for 2019, primarily reflecting higher proved property impairments as described below.\nImpairments of proved oil and gas properties totaled $182.6 million for 2020, of which $181.0 million was recognized in the 2020 first quarter and $1.6 million was recognized in the 2020 third quarter, resulting from the significant decrease in commodity prices that indicated the carrying values for certain fields were not recoverable. The impairments were recognized on legacy properties in the Red River Units ($168.1 million) and various non-core properties in the North and South regions ($14.5 million). Additionally, in response to decreased crude oil prices, we recognized a $24.5 million impairment in the 2020 first quarter to reduce the value of our crude oil inventory to estimated net realizable value at the time of impairment. There were no significant proved property impairments recognized in 2019.\nImpairments of unproved properties decreased $11.7 million, or 14%, to $70.8 million in 2020 compared to $82.5 million in 2019 due to a reduction in the balance of unamortized leasehold costs over the past year.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses. G&A expenses totaled $196.6 million for 2020, consistent with $195.3 million for 2019 due to offsetting changes in equity compensation expenses and other G&A charges as described below.\nTotal G&A expenses include non-cash charges for equity compensation of $64.6 million and $52.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, the increase of which was due to additional grants of restricted stock awards coupled with higher forfeitures of unvested stock in 2019 that resulted in lower equity compensation expense for that period.\nG&A expenses other than equity compensation totaled $132.0 million for 2020, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 8%, compared to $143.3 million for 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee benefits and other efforts to reduce spending in response to significantly reduced commodity prices and economic turmoil from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower overhead recoveries from joint interest owners driven by reduced drilling, completion, and production activities.\nThe following table shows the components of G&A expenses on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$/Boe </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in equity compensation expenses on a per-Boe basis in 2020 was driven by an 11% decrease in total sales volumes with no similar reduction in equity compensation expenses, as such expenses continue to be recognized irrespective of sales volumes.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $11.2 million, or 4%, to $258.2 million for 2020 compared to $269.4 million for 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from changes in the mix of outstanding debt between periods driven by the redemption or repurchase of senior notes over the past year using available cash and lower-rate credit facility borrowings. Our weighted average interest rate amounted to 4.3% for 2020 compared to 4.5% for 2019.\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt. In 2020 we redeemed or repurchased a portion of our outstanding 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2024 Notes and recognized net gains totaling $35.7 million upon the redemptions and repurchases. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 7. Long-Term Debt for additional discussion.\nIncome Taxes. For 2020 and 2019 we provided for income taxes at a combined federal and state tax rate of 24.5% of pre-tax income generated by our operations in the United States. We recorded an income tax benefit of $169.2 million and an income tax provision of $212.7 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 21.8% and 21.5%, respectively, after taking into account the application of statutory tax rates, permanent taxable differences, tax effects from equity compensation, valuation allowances, tax effects from the 2019 sale of our Canadian operations, and other items. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 10. Income Taxes for a summary of the sources and tax effects of items comprising our income tax provision and resulting effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows generated from operating activities, financing provided by our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, asset dispositions and joint development arrangements have provided a source of cash flow for use in reducing debt and enhancing liquidity. In light of the challenges facing our business and industry, we remain committed to operating in a responsible manner to preserve financial flexibility, liquidity, and the strength of our balance sheet. We intend to continue reducing our long-term debt using available cash flows from operations and/or proceeds from potential sales of assets or through joint development arrangements; however, no assurance can be given that such transactions will occur.\nAt January 31, 2021, we had approximately $1.13 billion of borrowing availability under our credit facility after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. Our credit facility, which is unsecured and has no borrowing base subject to redetermination, does not mature until April 2023. Further, we have no senior note maturities in the next 12 months, with our earliest scheduled maturity being our $230.8 million of 2022 Notes due in September 2022.\nBased on our planned capital spending, our forecasted cash flows and projected levels of indebtedness, we expect to maintain compliance with the covenants under our credit facility and senior note indentures. Further, based on current market indications, we expect to meet in the ordinary course of business other contractual cash commitments to third parties pursuant to the various agreements subsequently described under the heading Contractual Obligations, recognizing we may be required to meet such commitments even if our business plan assumptions were to change. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and have the ability to reduce spending or dispose of assets to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility if needed to fund our operations.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.42 billion and $3.12 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting a significant decrease in our operating cash flows due to the previously described decrease in market prices and our voluntary curtailment of production in the second and third quarters which adversely impacted our 2020 operating results. As a result of our resumed production and improved commodity prices late in the year, our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $487.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an improvement of $196.3 million, or 67%, compared to $291.2 million of operating cash flows generated in the third quarter of 2020.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $1.51 billion and $2.77 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting the significant decrease in our drilling and completion activities in 2020 prompted by the decrease in crude oil prices and economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2020 totaled $97.1 million, primarily consisting of $1.48 billion of net proceeds received from our November 2020 issuance of 5.75% senior notes due 2031, $105.0 million of net credit facility borrowings, and net proceeds of $26.0 million from new term loans executed during the year. These increases were partially offset by $1.34 billion of senior note repurchases and redemptions during the year using available cash and proceeds from our issuance of 2031 Notes, $25.2 million of premiums and costs paid upon the redemptions and repurchases, $126.9 million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and $18.5 million of cash dividends paid on common stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 totaled $587.1 million primarily resulting from a $441.8 million net reduction in total outstanding debt due in part to our partial redemption of 2022 Notes in September 2019. Additionally, $18.4 million of cash was used to fund our inaugural dividend payment in November 2019 and $190.2 million of cash was used to repurchase shares of our common stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by $109.1 million of contributions received from noncontrolling interests, primarily from Franco-Nevada for the funding of its share of mineral acquisition costs incurred by The Mineral Resources Company II.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nAlthough we cannot provide any assurance, we believe funds from operating cash flows and availability under our credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements inclusive of, but not limited to, normal operating needs, debt service obligations, planned capital expenditures, and commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nOur 2021 capital budget is reflective of the current commodity price environment and, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be funded from operating cash flows. Any cash flow deficiencies are expected to be funded by borrowings under our credit facility. If cash flows are materially impacted by declines in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our credit facility if needed to fund our operations and business plans. We may choose to access banking or capital markets for additional financing or capital to fund our operations or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, although uncertainties existing in the financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors may increase the expense and difficulty of completing a bank or capital markets financing. Additionally, the terms available to the Company in connection with such a financing transaction may be less favorable than those enjoyed by the Company prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, although the degree, if any, by which such terms may change cannot be predicted at this time. Further, we may sell assets or enter into strategic joint development opportunities in order to obtain funding if such transactions can be executed on satisfactory terms. However, no assurance can be given that such transactions will occur.\nIn March 2020, our corporate credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (\"S&P\") in response to weakened oil and gas industry conditions and resulting revisions made to rating agency commodity price assumptions. Such downgrade negatively impacted our cost of capital and increased our borrowing costs under our credit facility. Also in March 2020, our corporate credit ratings were reaffirmed by both Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. Such ratings are subject to ongoing review and adjustment.\nCredit facility\nWe have an unsecured credit facility, maturing in April 2023, with aggregate lender commitments totaling $1.5 billion. The commitments are from a syndicate of 14 banks and financial institutions. We believe each member of the current syndicate has the capability to fund its commitment. As of January 31, 2021, we had $360 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.13 billion of borrowing availability on our credit facility.\nThe commitments under our credit facility are not dependent on a borrowing base calculation subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating, such as the downgrade by S&P that occurred in March 2020 in response to weakened oil and gas industry conditions, do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. The downgrade of our credit rating did, however, trigger a 0.25% increase in our credit facility's interest rate and prompted a 0.05% increase in the rate of commitment fees paid on unused borrowing availability.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, or merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also contains a requirement that we maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 7. Long-Term Debt for a discussion of how this ratio is calculated pursuant to our revolving credit agreement.\nWe were in compliance with our credit facility covenants at December 31, 2020 and expect to maintain compliance. At December 31, 2020, our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.42 to 1.00. We do not believe the credit facility covenants are reasonably likely to limit our ability to undertake additional debt financing to a material extent if needed to support our business.\nAt December 31, 2020, our total debt would have needed to independently increase by approximately $8.4 billion above the existing level at that date (with no corresponding increase in cash or reduction in refinanced debt) to reach the maximum covenant ratio of 0.65 to 1.00. Alternatively, our total shareholders' equity would have needed to independently decrease by approximately $4.5 billion (excluding the after-tax impact of any non-cash impairment charges) below the existing level at December 31, 2020 to reach the maximum covenant ratio. These independent point-in-time sensitivities do not take into account other factors that could arise to mitigate the impact of changes in debt and equity on our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio, such as disposing of assets or exploring alternative sources of capitalization.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nSenior notes\nIn January 2021, we redeemed an additional $400 million principal amount of our outstanding 2022 Notes using proceeds from lower-rate credit facility borrowings. Our outstanding senior note obligations now total $5.0 billion at January 31, 2021. We have no senior note maturities in the next 12 months, with our earliest scheduled maturity being our $230.8 million of remaining 2022 Notes due in September 2022. Our senior notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund requirements. For further information on the face values, maturity dates, semi-annual interest payment dates, optional redemption periods and covenant restrictions related to our senior notes, refer to Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 7. Long-Term Debt.\nWe were in compliance with our senior note covenants at December 31, 2020 and expect to maintain compliance. We do not believe the senior note covenants will materially limit our ability to undertake additional debt financing. Downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to the credit ratings assigned to our senior unsecured debt, such as the downgrade by S&P that occurred in March 2020, do not trigger additional senior note covenants.\nMineral acquisition relationship\nIn October 2018, Continental entered into a strategic relationship with Franco-Nevada Corporation to acquire oil and gas mineral interests within an area of mutual interest through a minerals subsidiary named The Mineral Resources Company II, LLC (\"TMRC II\"). Under the relationship, the parties have committed to spend up to a remaining aggregate total of $153 million to acquire mineral interests. Continental agreed to fund 20% of future mineral acquisitions and will be entitled to receive between 25% and 50% of total revenues generated by TMRC II based upon performance relative to predetermined production targets, while Franco-Nevada will fund 80% of future acquisitions and will be entitled to receive between 50% and 75% of TMRC II's revenues. Based upon production targets achieved to date, Continental is currently earning 50% of TMRC II's revenues and such allocation is expected to continue through at least year-end 2021.\nCapital expenditures\nOur original capital budget for 2020 was $2.65 billion, excluding acquisitions, which was reduced to $1.2 billion in March 2020 in response to the significant decrease in crude oil prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. We significantly reduced our drilling and completion activities in order to preserve our assets and better align our spending with expected available cash flows. As a result of these actions, our non-acquisition capital spending was reduced by 56% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested $1.16 billion in our capital program excluding $204.0 million of unbudgeted acquisitions and excluding $133.9 million of capital costs associated with reduced accruals for capital expenditures as compared to December 31, 2019. Our 2020 capital expenditures were allocated as follows by quarter:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions </td> <td>1Q 2020 </td> <td>2Q 2020 </td> <td>3Q 2020 </td> <td>4Q 2020 </td> <td>Total 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>544.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>971.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land costs (1) </td> <td>39.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>58.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital facilities, workovers and other corporate assets </td> <td>63.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>124.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seismic </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>650.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,159.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of producing properties </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>37.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>60.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of non-producing properties </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>132.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>143.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total acquisitions (2) </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>169.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>204.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,363.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Full year 2020 amount includes $24 million of mineral acquisitions made by TMRC II, of which $19 million was recouped from Franco-Nevada.\n(2) The 2020 fourth quarter amount includes our October 2020 acquisition of undeveloped leasehold and producing properties in the SCOOP play for $162.8 million and excludes the $21.5 million escrow deposit paid on December 31, 2020 associated with a pending property acquisition as discussed in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.\n2021 Capital Budget\nIn 2021, we will remain committed to operating in a disciplined, capital-efficient manner in light of continued volatility in commodity prices. Our 2021 capital budget is expected to be allocated as reflected in the table below. Acquisition expenditures are not budgeted, with the exception of planned levels of spending for mineral acquisitions made in conjunction with our relationship with Franco-Nevada.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions </td> <td>2021 Budget </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land costs </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral acquisitions attributable to Continental (1) </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital facilities, workovers, water infrastructure, and other corporate assets </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seismic </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 capital budget attributable to Continental </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral acquisitions attributable to Franco-Nevada (1) </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total 2021 capital budget (2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents planned spending for mineral acquisitions by TMRC II under our relationship with Franco-Nevada Corporation. Continental holds a controlling financial interest in TMRC II and therefore consolidates the financial results and capital expenditures of the entity. With a carry structure in place, Continental will fund 20% of 2021 planned spending, or $13 million, and Franco-Nevada will fund the remaining 80%, or $52 million.\n(2) Excludes the Company's pending acquisition of properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming for $215 million discussed in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOur drilling and completion activities and the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of, among other things, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling and completion results, operational process improvements, the availability of drilling and completion rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation, gathering and processing capacity, changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may scale back our spending should commodity prices decrease from current levels. Conversely, an increase in commodity prices from current levels could result in increased capital expenditures. We expect to continue participating as a buyer of properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at competitive terms.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year (2021) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 2 and 3\n(2022-2023) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 4 and 5\n(2024-2025) </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility borrowings (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes (1)(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>5,391,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,280,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>911,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,200,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable (3) </td> <td> </td> <td>24,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,633 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments and commitment fees (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>2,316,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,219,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (5) </td> <td> </td> <td>179,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases and other (6) </td> <td> </td> <td>33,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,758 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling rig commitments (7) </td> <td> </td> <td>14,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation and processing commitments (8) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,450,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>513,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346,007 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,570,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,471,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,630,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,940,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)On January 5, 2021, we redeemed $400 million principal amount of our outstanding 2022 Notes using proceeds from borrowings on our credit facility.

Principal and interest are payable monthly through the loans' maturity dates in May 2030.\n(4)Interest payments include scheduled cash interest payments on the senior notes and notes payable, as well as estimated interest payments and commitment fees on unused borrowing availability under our credit facility assuming the $1.33 billion of availability as of December 31, 2020 continues through the April 2023 maturity date of the facility.\n(5)Amounts represent estimated discounted costs for future dismantlement and abandonment of our crude oil and natural gas properties. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional discussion of our asset retirement obligations.\n(6)Amounts primarily represent commitments for electric infrastructure, surface use agreements, office buildings and equipment, communication towers, field equipment, and purchase obligations mainly related to software services. A portion of these costs will be borne by other interest owners. Due to variations in well ownership, our net share of these costs cannot be determined with certainty. These amounts include minimum payment obligations on enforceable commitments with durations in excess of one year with a discounted present value totaling $6.4 million that qualify as leases and were recognized on our balance sheet at December 31, 2020 in accordance with ASC Topic 842.\n(7)Amounts represent operating day-rate commitments under drilling rig contracts with various terms extending to May 2021. A portion of these costs will be borne by other interest owners, the amount of which cannot be determined with certainty. These amounts include minimum payment obligations with a discounted present value totaling $2.0 million that qualify as leases and were recognized on our balance sheet at December 31, 2020 in accordance with ASC Topic 842.\n(8)We have entered into transportation and processing commitments to guarantee capacity on crude oil and natural gas pipelines and natural gas processing facilities. These commitments require us to pay per-unit transportation or processing charges regardless of the amount of capacity used. We are not committed under these contracts to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil or natural gas in the future. A portion of these costs will be borne by other interest owners, the amount of which cannot be determined with certainty. These commitments do not qualify as leases under ASC Topic 842 and are not recognized on our balance sheet.\nOn December 31, 2020, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire undeveloped leasehold and producing properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming for $215 million of cash. Closing of the acquisition is scheduled to occur on or around March 4, 2021. This pending acquisition remains subject to the completion of customary due diligence procedures and closing conditions and is not reflected in the table above.\nDelivery Commitments\nWe have various natural gas volume delivery commitments that are related to our North and South areas. We expect to primarily fulfill our contractual obligations with production from our proved reserves. However, we may purchase third-party volumes to satisfy our commitments. The volumes disclosed herein represent gross production associated with properties operated by us and do not reflect our net proportionate share of such amounts. As of December 31, 2020, we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of natural gas production.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ending </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural Gas </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Bcf </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Instruments\nSee Note 5.

Through December 31, 2020, we had repurchased and retired a cumulative total of approximately 13.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $317.1 million since the inception of the program. The timing and amount of the Company's share repurchases are subject to market conditions and management discretion. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. To preserve cash in the current environment, we do not expect to engage in significant share repurchase activity in the near term.\nSenior note repurchases\nAs discussed in Note 7. Long-Term Debt and Note 21. Subsequent Event in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2020 and early 2021 we repurchased a portion of our outstanding senior notes. From time to time we may seek to execute additional repurchases of our senior notes for cash in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and prospects for future access to capital, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contain information that is pertinent to our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosure and estimation of contingent assets and liabilities. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8. Revenues for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.\nIn management's opinion, the most significant reporting areas impacted by management's judgments and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimations, revenue recognition, the choice of accounting method for crude oil and natural gas activities and derivatives, impairment of assets, income taxes and contingent liabilities. These areas are discussed below. Management's judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Estimation and Standardized Measure of Future Cash Flows\nOur external independent reserve engineers, Ryder Scott, and internal technical staff prepare the estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Estimates of reserves and their values, future production rates, and future costs and expenses are inherently uncertain for various reasons, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Reserve estimates are updated by us at least semi-annually and take into account recent production levels and other technical information about each of our properties.\nCrude oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Periodic revisions or removals of estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, crude oil and natural gas prices, changes in costs, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, changes in business strategies, or other economic factors. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas ultimately recovered. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net downward revisions and removals of our proved reserves totaled approximately 505 MMBoe, 149 MMBoe, and 269 MMBoe, respectively. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions or removals.\nEstimates of proved reserves are key components of the Company's most significant financial estimates including the computation of depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties. Holding all other factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Conversely, if proved reserves are revised upward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would\ndecrease. Future revisions of reserves may be material and could significantly alter future depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense and may result in material impairments of assets.\nAt December 31, 2020, our proved reserves totaled 1,104 MMBoe as determined using 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices of $39.57 per barrel for crude oil and $1.99 per MMBtu for natural gas. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than those used in our year-end estimates. NYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021 averaged $51.04 per barrel and $2.53 per MMBtu, respectively.\nHolding all other factors constant, if crude oil prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were increased to $50 per barrel our proved reserves at December 31, 2020 could increase by approximately 52 MMBoe, or 5%, representing a 7% increase in proved developed producing reserves averaged with a 2% increase in PUD reserves. If the increase in proved reserves under this oil price sensitivity existed throughout 2020, our DD&A expense for 2020 would have decreased by an estimated 7%.\nHolding all other factors constant, if natural gas prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were increased to $2.50 per MMBtu our proved reserves at December 31, 2020 could increase by approximately 21 MMBoe, or 2%, representing a 3% increase in proved developed producing reserves averaged with a 1% increase in PUD reserves. If the increase in proved reserves under this gas price sensitivity existed throughout 2020, our DD&A expense for 2020 would have decreased by an estimated 3%.\nOur DD&A calculations for oil and gas properties are performed on a field basis and revisions to proved reserves will not necessarily be applied ratably across all fields and may not be applied to some fields at all. Further, reserve revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. As a result, the impact on DD&A expense from revisions in reserves cannot be predicted with certainty and may result in changes in expense that are greater or less than the underlying changes in reserves.\nSee Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves-Proved Reserve, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities for additional proved reserve sensitivities under certain increasing and decreasing commodity price scenarios for crude oil and natural gas.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of crude oil and natural gas. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8. Revenues for discussion of our accounting policies governing the recognition and presentation of revenues.\nOperated crude oil and natural gas revenues are recognized during the month in which control transfers to the customer and it is probable the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to receive. For non-operated properties, the Company's proportionate share of production is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators. Non-operated revenues are recognized by the Company during the month in which production occurs and it is probable the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to receive.\nAt the end of each month, to record revenues we estimate the amount of production delivered and sold to customers and the prices at which they were sold. Variances between estimated revenues and actual amounts received for all prior months are recorded in the month payment is received and are reflected in our financial statements as crude oil and natural gas sales. These variances have historically not been material.\nFor the sale of crude oil and natural gas, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis (revenues presented separately from associated expenses), or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the products before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators. Judgment may be required in determining the point in time when control of products transfers to customers.\nSuccessful Efforts Method of Accounting\nOur business is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the crude oil and natural gas industry. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available-the successful efforts method and the full cost method. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of the accounting policies applicable to the successful efforts method of accounting.\nDerivative Activities\nFrom time to time we may utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of future crude oil and natural gas production and for other purposes. We have elected not to designate any of our price risk management activities as cash flow hedges. As a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the changes in fair value in current earnings.\nIn determining the amounts to be recorded for outstanding derivative contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivatives. We use an independent third party to provide our derivative valuations. The third party's valuation models for derivative contracts are industry-standard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The fair value calculations for collars requires the use of an option-pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the derivative agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the derivatives are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates.\nWe validate our derivative valuations through management review and by comparison to our counterparties' valuations for reasonableness. Differences between our fair value calculations and counterparty valuations have historically not been material.\nImpairment of Assets\nAll of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk-adjusted proved reserves. Risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves may be taken into consideration when determining estimated future net cash flows and fair value when such reserves exist and are economically recoverable.\nProved crude oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field-by-field basis. If the carrying amount of a field exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of the field is reduced to its estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model. For producing properties, the impairment evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, future costs to produce those products, estimates of future crude oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test a field for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions or removals of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Estimates of anticipated sales prices and recoverable reserves are highly judgmental and are subject to material revision in future periods.\nImpairment provisions for proved properties totaled $207.1 million for 2020. Commodity price assumptions used for the year-end December 31, 2020 impairment calculations were based on publicly available average annual forward commodity strip prices through year-end 2025 and were then escalated at 3% per year thereafter. Holding all other factors constant, as forward commodity prices decrease, our probability for recognizing producing property impairments may increase, or the magnitude of impairments to be recognized may increase. Conversely, as forward commodity prices increase, our probability for recognizing producing property impairments may decrease, or the magnitude of impairments to be recognized may decrease or be eliminated. As of December 31, 2020, the publicly available forward commodity strip prices for the year 2025 used in our fourth quarter impairment calculations averaged $44.82 per barrel for crude oil and $2.52 per Mcf for natural gas. If forward commodity prices materially decrease from current levels for an extended period, additional impairments of producing properties may be recognized in the future. Because of the uncertainty inherent in the numerous factors utilized in determining the fair value of producing properties, we cannot predict the timing and amount of future impairment charges, if any.\nImpairment losses for unproved properties are generally recognized by amortizing the portion of the properties' costs which management estimates will not be transferred to proved properties over the lives of the leases based on drilling plans, experience of successful drilling, and the average holding period. The impairment assessments are affected by economic factors such as the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, anticipated drilling programs, remaining lease terms, and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. The estimated timing and rate of successful drilling is highly judgmental and is subject to material revision in future periods as better information becomes available.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We apply judgment to determine the weight of both positive and negative evidence in order to conclude whether a valuation allowance is necessary for our deferred tax assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required for our deferred tax asset balances, we consider, among other factors, current financial position, results of operations, projected future taxable income, reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities against deferred tax assets, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of the tax benefit, and tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is involved in this determination as we are required to make assumptions about future commodity prices, projected production, development activities, profitability of future business strategies and forecasted economics in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, changes in the effective tax rate resulting from changes in tax law and our level of earnings may limit utilization of deferred tax assets and may affect the valuation of deferred tax balances in the future. Changes in judgment regarding future realization of deferred tax assets may result in a reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.\nWe believe our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis in determining the need for additional valuation allowances with respect to our deferred tax assets. In 2020, we determined it was more likely than not that a portion of our Oklahoma net operating loss carryforward would not be utilized before expiration, and a valuation allowance of $14.5 million was established during the year for the deferred tax asset associated with such net operating loss carryforward.\nContingent Liabilities\nA provision for legal, environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when a loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Determining when liabilities and expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts of accruals is subject to an estimation process that requires subjective judgment of management. In certain cases, management's judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers, the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law, the experience of the Company and other companies dealing with similar matters, and management's decision on how it intends to respond to a particular matter; for example, a decision to contest it vigorously or a decision to seek a negotiated settlement. Actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. We closely monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate of when or if to record liabilities and losses for matters based on available information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrently, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resources.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 9. Allowance for Credit Losses for a discussion of the new credit loss accounting standard adopted on January 1, 2020.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a discussion of significant laws and regulations that have been enacted or are currently being considered by regulatory bodies that may affect us in the areas in which we operate. In particular, in January 2021 President Biden issued executive orders that, among other things, suspend new permitting and leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on federal lands and establish new greenhouse gas emission standards for the oil and gas sector. President Biden may continue to issue additional executive orders in pursuit of his regulatory agenda and, with control of Congress shifting in January 2021, there is the potential for the revision of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new legislation that could adversely affect the oil and gas industry.\nInflation\nAs a result of the low commodity price environment in recent years, the number of providers of services, equipment, and materials have decreased in the regions where we operate. If commodity prices show signs of diminished volatility and sustained recovery, industry drilling and completion activities are likely to increase and we may face shortages of service providers, equipment, and materials. Such shortages could result in increased competition which may lead to increases in costs.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales and net sales prices\nRevenues and transportation expenses associated with production from our operated properties are reported separately as discussed in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8. Revenues. For non-operated properties, we receive a net payment from the operator for our share of sales proceeds which is net of costs incurred by the operator, if any. Such non-operated revenues are recognized at the net amount of proceeds received. As a result, the separate presentation of revenues and transportation expenses from our operated properties differs from the net presentation from non-operated properties. This impacts the comparability of certain operating metrics, such as per-unit sales prices, when such metrics are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP using gross presentation for some revenues and net presentation for others.\nIn order to provide metrics prepared in a manner consistent with how management assesses the Company's operating results and to achieve comparability between operated and non-operated revenues, we have presented crude oil and natural gas sales net of transportation expenses in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which we refer to as \"net crude oil and natural gas sales,\" a non-GAAP measure. Average sales prices calculated using net crude oil and natural gas sales are referred to as \"net sales prices,\" a non-GAAP measure, and are calculated by taking revenues less transportation expenses divided by sales volumes, whether for crude oil or natural gas, as applicable. Management believes presenting our revenues and sales prices net of transportation expenses is useful because it normalizes the presentation differences between operated and non-operated revenues and allows for a useful comparison of net realized prices to NYMEX benchmark prices on a Company-wide basis.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of total Company crude oil and natural gas sales (GAAP) to net crude oil and natural gas sales and related net sales prices (non-GAAP) for 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>Crude oil </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural gas </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Crude oil </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural gas </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Crude oil </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural gas </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas sales (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,199,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>355,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,555,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,929,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>584,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,514,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,792,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,678,722 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Transportation expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>(158,989) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,703) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(196,692) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191,998) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,651) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(225,649) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162,312) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,275) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191,587) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net crude oil and natural gas sales (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,040,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,358,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,737,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,288,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,630,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>856,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,487,135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales volumes (MBbl/MMcf/MBoe) </td> <td> </td> <td>58,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>306,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124,113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales price (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.01 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables present reconciliations of crude oil and natural gas sales (GAAP) to net crude oil and natural gas sales and related net sales prices (non-GAAP) for North Dakota Bakken and SCOOP for 2020, 2019, and 2018 as presented in Part I, Item 1.

directly comparable financial measure computed using U.S. GAAP. PV-10 generally differs from Standardized Measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. At December 31, 2020, our PV-10 totaled approximately $4.89 billion. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows was approximately $4.65 billion at December 31, 2020, representing a $239 million difference from PV-10 due to the effect of deducting estimated future income taxes in arriving at Standardized Measure. We believe the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities and is a useful measure of evaluating the relative monetary significance of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Investors may utilize PV-10 as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies. PV-10 should not be considered as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, the Standardized Measure as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a crude oil and natural gas company's financial condition and operations, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its performance in 2020.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Results attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to consolidated results and are not separately presented or discussed below.\nThe following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, along with Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the Safe Harbor\u201d Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 at the beginning of this report, for information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward-looking statements.\nOur operating results for 2020 discussed below were impacted by the economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on crude oil demand and prices and may not be indicative of future results. Given the economic uncertainty from the pandemic and ongoing volatility in commodity prices, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic or other factors will have on the Company's performance in 2021 and beyond.\nOverview\nWe are an independent crude oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. We derive the majority of our operating income and cash flows from the sale of crude oil and natural gas and expect this to continue in the future. Our operations are primarily focused on exploration and development activities in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana and the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLR\u201d and our corporate internet website is www.clr.com.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nCrude oil prices decreased to historically low levels in April 2020 due primarily to reduced global and domestic demand for crude oil caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in consumer behavior and restrictions implemented by governments to mitigate the pandemic. In response to the significant reduction in crude oil prices, we began voluntarily curtailing our production in April 2020 and ultimately curtailed approximately 55% of our operated crude oil production and associated natural gas in the 2020 second quarter. Additionally, in light of the challenges facing our business and industry, we implemented cost saving initiatives and significantly reduced our operated rig and completion crew counts in order to preserve our assets and better align our capital spending with expected available cash flows, resulting in a $1.5 billion, or 56%, decrease in our non-acquisition capital spending in 2020 compared to 2019. These actions, coupled with historically low crude oil prices, resulted in a material reduction in our production, revenues, and cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019.\nCrude oil prices began to stabilize in mid-2020 and generally improved in the second half of 2020 in response to the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of economic activity, and the resulting increase in crude oil demand. In July 2020 we began to gradually restore our curtailed production and subsequently brought our remaining curtailed production back online in September 2020. As a result of our resumed production, coupled with strategic well completion activities in late 2020, our total average production improved to 339,307 Boe per day for the 2020 fourth quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020, yet still remaining 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDespite the gradual improvement in crude oil prices in the second half of 2020, we continued our commitment to operating in a disciplined, capital efficient manner. Improved revenues from higher commodity prices coupled with our tempered spending resulted in the generation of cash flows in excess of operating and capital needs in the second half of 2020 that allowed for a $210 million net reduction in our total debt at December 31, 2020 compared to June 30, 2020. Additionally, despite production curtailments during the year, we continued to drive our per-unit production expenses lower to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019.\nWe remain committed to the responsible stewardship of our assets and continue to focus on maximizing cash flows, further reducing debt, delivering low-cost capital efficient operations, and generating shareholder value. The depth and quality of our asset base, the commodity optionality provided by our significant amount of acreage held by production, and our financial strength allow us to be adaptable in a variety of price environments. We remain flexible as we monitor and adapt to market conditions. See the subsequent section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion of our financial condition.\nFinancial and Operating Metrics\nThe following table contains financial and operating highlights for the periods presented. Average net sales prices exclude any effect of derivative transactions. Per-unit expenses have been calculated using sales volumes.\n\n(1) See the subsequent section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion and calculation of net sales prices, which are non-GAAP measures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial and operating information for the periods presented.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nBelow is a discussion of changes in our results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019. A discussion of changes in our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.\nProduction\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our average daily Boe production by major operating area for the periods presented.\n\nThe following tables reflect our production by product and region for the periods presented.\n\n\nThe 19% decrease in crude oil production in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a 12,763 MBbls, or 24%, decrease in Bakken oil production along with a 1,315 MBbls, or 37%, decrease in STACK oil production due to the previously described production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities undertaken in response to the adverse commodity price environment during the year. These decreases were partially offset by a 906 MBbls, or 8%, increase in crude oil production in SCOOP due to new well completions over the past year in our oil-weighted Project SpringBoard, which exceeded the impact of production curtailments in the play.\nOur production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities in 2020 also impacted our natural gas production, leading to a 28,202 MMcf, or 29%, decrease in STACK natural gas production and a 1,501 MMcf, or 1%, decrease in Bakken natural gas production in 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were partially offset by a 24,974 MMcf, or 22%, increase in SCOOP natural gas production in conjunction with the previously described increase in SCOOP crude oil production in 2020.\nWe have a deep inventory of both oil and gas assets that allow us to be responsive to changes in oil and gas commodity price fundamentals. In the second quarter of 2020 we strategically shifted our rigs to gas-weighted areas in Oklahoma to capitalize on improvements in market prices for natural gas. These actions contributed to an increase in our natural gas production as a percentage of total production from 42% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 and an increase in our South region production as a percentage of total production from 40% in 2019 to 45% in 2020.\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of sales of crude oil and natural gas, gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments, and revenues associated with crude oil and natural gas service operations.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales and related net sales prices presented below are non-GAAP measures. See the subsequent section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for discussion and calculation of these measures.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales. Net crude oil and natural gas sales for 2020 totaled $2.36 billion, a 45% decrease compared to net sales of $4.29 billion for 2019 due to significant decreases in net sales prices and sales volumes as discussed below.\nTotal sales volumes for 2020 decreased 14,232 MBoe, or 11%, compared to 2019, reflecting reduced sales from the previously described production curtailments in the current year. For 2020, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 18% compared to 2019, while our natural gas sales volumes decreased 2%.\nOur crude oil net sales prices averaged $34.71 per barrel for 2020, a decrease of 33% compared to $51.82 per barrel for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and wider price differentials. The differential between NYMEX West Texas Intermediate calendar month crude oil prices and our realized crude oil net sales prices averaged $5.80 per barrel in 2020 compared to $5.15 per barrel in 2019. The increased differential reflects changes in supply and demand fundamentals and economic effects from COVID-19 that impacted location differentials and price realizations in the first and second quarters of 2020 compared to the prior year. Our crude oil net sales price differential to NYMEX averaged $5.20 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur natural gas net sales prices averaged $1.04 per Mcf for 2020, a 41% decrease compared to $1.77 per Mcf for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and lower price realizations. The discount between our net sales prices and NYMEX Henry Hub calendar month natural gas prices weakened to $1.10 per Mcf for 2020 compared to $0.86 per Mcf for 2019. We sell the majority of our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur. The field markets are impacted by residue gas and natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") prices at secondary, downstream markets. NGL prices decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 levels in conjunction with decreased crude oil prices and other factors, resulting in reduced price realizations for our natural gas sales stream relative to benchmark prices. As a result of the decrease in prices, under certain of our arrangements on operated properties the contractual pricing adjustments applied by midstream customers exceeded the sales consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the customers. Additionally, in some instances on non-operated properties the costs incurred by the outside operator exceeded the consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the outside operator. The net amounts paid or payable under these arrangements on operated and non-operated properties totaled $42.9 million for 2020, and are reflected as a reduction of natural gas revenues and net sales prices. Nearly all of such amounts were associated with our North region natural gas production.\nDerivatives. Changes in market prices during 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives, which resulted in negative revenue adjustments of $14.7 million for the year, representing $28.2 million of cash losses partially offset by $13.5 million of unsettled non-cash gains. For 2019, we recognized positive revenue adjustments of $49.1 million resulting from changes in market prices that had a favorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives.\nCrude oil and natural gas service operations. Our crude oil and natural gas service operations consist primarily of revenues associated with water gathering, recycling, and disposal activities, which are impacted by our production volumes and the timing and extent of our drilling and completion projects. Revenues associated with such activities decreased $22.8 million, or 33%, from $68.5 million for 2019 to $45.7 million for 2020 due to reduced water handling activities resulting from our curtailment of production and reduced completion activities during the year. The decreased activities also resulted in a reduction in service-related expenses compared to the prior period.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nProduction expenses. Production expenses decreased $85.3 million, or 19%, to $359.3 million for 2020 compared to $444.6 million for 2019. This decrease resulted from reduced service costs being incurred in conjunction with production curtailments and cost control efforts, operating efficiency gains, and a higher portion of our production coming from wells in Oklahoma which typically have lower operating costs compared to wells in the Bakken, all of which led to a reduction in our production expenses to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019. Despite our production curtailments, we achieved sequential reductions in our per-Boe production expenses each quarter during 2020 and, as a result of our efficient operations and low-cost production growth in Oklahoma late in the year, our production expenses decreased to a notably low $2.80 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter.\nProduction taxes. Production taxes decreased $165.3 million, or 46%, to $192.7 million for 2020 compared to $358.0 million for 2019 due to a 43% decrease in crude oil and natural gas sales. Our production taxes as a percentage of net crude oil and natural gas sales averaged 8.2% for 2020, consistent with 8.3% for 2019.\nExploration expenses. Exploration expenses, which consist primarily of exploratory geological and geophysical costs and dry hole costs that are expensed as incurred, increased $3.0 million, or 21%, to $17.7 million for 2020 compared to $14.7 million for 2019 due to changes in the timing and extent of our exploration-related activities. The 2020 period includes $6.3 million of dry hole costs recognized in the first quarter associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well with no comparable dry hole costs incurred in 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d). Total DD&A decreased $136.4 million, or 7%, to $1.88 billion for 2020 compared to $2.02 billion for 2019 due to an 11% decrease in total sales volumes, the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in our DD&A rate per Boe as further discussed below. The following table shows the components of our DD&A on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\n\nEstimated proved reserves are a key component in our computation of DD&A expense. Proved reserves are determined using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months as required by SEC rules. Holding all other factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward due to commodity price declines or other reasons, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases. Conversely, if proved reserves are revised upward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense decreases.\nDownward revisions of proved reserves at year-end 2020 prompted by the significant decrease in average commodity prices and other factors resulted in an increase in our DD&A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties compared to 2019. As a result of these downward revisions, our DD&A increased to $19.01 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $16.45 per Boe for the 2019 fourth quarter, which contributed to the overall increase in our DD&A rate for the full year of 2020.\nNYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021 averaged $51.04 per barrel and $2.53 per MMBtu, respectively, which are notably higher than average prices in 2020. If commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period, upward price-related revisions of proved reserves may occur in the future, which may be significant and could result in a decrease in our DD&A rate relative to the 2020 fourth quarter. We are unable to predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on our future DD&A rate.\nProperty impairments. Property impairments increased $191.7 million to $277.9 million for 2020 compared to $86.2 million for 2019, primarily reflecting higher proved property impairments as described below.\nImpairments of proved oil and gas properties totaled $182.6 million for 2020, of which $181.0 million was recognized in the 2020 first quarter and $1.6 million was recognized in the 2020 third quarter, resulting from the significant decrease in commodity prices that indicated the carrying values for certain fields were not recoverable. The impairments were recognized on legacy properties in the Red River Units ($168.1 million) and various non-core properties in the North and South regions ($14.5 million). Additionally, in response to decreased crude oil prices, we recognized a $24.5 million impairment in the 2020 first quarter to reduce the value of our crude oil inventory to estimated net realizable value at the time of impairment. There were no significant proved property impairments recognized in 2019.\nImpairments of unproved properties decreased $11.7 million, or 14%, to $70.8 million in 2020 compared to $82.5 million in 2019 due to a reduction in the balance of unamortized leasehold costs over the past year.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses. G&A expenses totaled $196.6 million for 2020, consistent with $195.3 million for 2019 due to offsetting changes in equity compensation expenses and other G&A charges as described below.\nTotal G&A expenses include non-cash charges for equity compensation of $64.6 million and $52.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, the increase of which was due to additional grants of restricted stock awards coupled with higher forfeitures of unvested stock in 2019 that resulted in lower equity compensation expense for that period.\nG&A expenses other than equity compensation totaled $132.0 million for 2020, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 8%, compared to $143.3 million for 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee benefits and other efforts to reduce spending in response to significantly reduced commodity prices and economic turmoil from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower overhead recoveries from joint interest owners driven by reduced drilling, completion, and production activities.\nThe following table shows the components of G&A expenses on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Results attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to consolidated results and are not separately presented or discussed below.\nThe following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, along with Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the Safe Harbor\u201d Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 at the beginning of this report, for information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward-looking statements.\nOur operating results for 2020 discussed below were impacted by the economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on crude oil demand and prices and may not be indicative of future results. Given the economic uncertainty from the pandemic and ongoing volatility in commodity prices, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic or other factors will have on the Company's performance in 2021 and beyond.\nOverview\nWe are an independent crude oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. We derive the majority of our operating income and cash flows from the sale of crude oil and natural gas and expect this to continue in the future. Our operations are primarily focused on exploration and development activities in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana and the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLR\u201d and our corporate internet website is www.clr.com.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nCrude oil prices decreased to historically low levels in April 2020 due primarily to reduced global and domestic demand for crude oil caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in consumer behavior and restrictions implemented by governments to mitigate the pandemic. In response to the significant reduction in crude oil prices, we began voluntarily curtailing our production in April 2020 and ultimately curtailed approximately 55% of our operated crude oil production and associated natural gas in the 2020 second quarter. Additionally, in light of the challenges facing our business and industry, we implemented cost saving initiatives and significantly reduced our operated rig and completion crew counts in order to preserve our assets and better align our capital spending with expected available cash flows, resulting in a $1.5 billion, or 56%, decrease in our non-acquisition capital spending in 2020 compared to 2019. These actions, coupled with historically low crude oil prices, resulted in a material reduction in our production, revenues, and cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019.\nCrude oil prices began to stabilize in mid-2020 and generally improved in the second half of 2020 in response to the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of economic activity, and the resulting increase in crude oil demand. In July 2020 we began to gradually restore our curtailed production and subsequently brought our remaining curtailed production back online in September 2020. As a result of our resumed production, coupled with strategic well completion activities in late 2020, our total average production improved to 339,307 Boe per day for the 2020 fourth quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020, yet still remaining 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDespite the gradual improvement in crude oil prices in the second half of 2020, we continued our commitment to operating in a disciplined, capital efficient manner. Improved revenues from higher commodity prices coupled with our tempered spending resulted in the generation of cash flows in excess of operating and capital needs in the second half of 2020 that allowed for a $210 million net reduction in our total debt at December 31, 2020 compared to June 30, 2020. Additionally, despite production curtailments during the year, we continued to drive our per-unit production expenses lower to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019.\nWe remain committed to the responsible stewardship of our assets and continue to focus on maximizing cash flows, further reducing debt, delivering low-cost capital efficient operations, and generating shareholder value. The depth and quality of our asset base, the commodity optionality provided by our significant amount of acreage held by production, and our financial strength allow us to be adaptable in a variety of price environments. We remain flexible as we monitor and adapt to market conditions. See the subsequent section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion of our financial condition.\nFinancial and Operating Metrics\nThe following table contains financial and operating highlights for the periods presented.

or 37%, decrease in STACK oil production due to the previously described production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities undertaken in response to the adverse commodity price environment during the year. These decreases were partially offset by a 906 MBbls, or 8%, increase in crude oil production in SCOOP due to new well completions over the past year in our oil-weighted Project SpringBoard, which exceeded the impact of production curtailments in the play.\nOur production curtailments and limited drilling and completion activities in 2020 also impacted our natural gas production, leading to a 28,202 MMcf, or 29%, decrease in STACK natural gas production and a 1,501 MMcf, or 1%, decrease in Bakken natural gas production in 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were partially offset by a 24,974 MMcf, or 22%, increase in SCOOP natural gas production in conjunction with the previously described increase in SCOOP crude oil production in 2020.\nWe have a deep inventory of both oil and gas assets that allow us to be responsive to changes in oil and gas commodity price fundamentals. In the second quarter of 2020 we strategically shifted our rigs to gas-weighted areas in Oklahoma to capitalize on improvements in market prices for natural gas. These actions contributed to an increase in our natural gas production as a percentage of total production from 42% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 and an increase in our South region production as a percentage of total production from 40% in 2019 to 45% in 2020.\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of sales of crude oil and natural gas, gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments, and revenues associated with crude oil and natural gas service operations.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales and related net sales prices presented below are non-GAAP measures. See the subsequent section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for discussion and calculation of these measures.\nNet crude oil and natural gas sales. Net crude oil and natural gas sales for 2020 totaled $2.36 billion, a 45% decrease compared to net sales of $4.29 billion for 2019 due to significant decreases in net sales prices and sales volumes as discussed below.\nTotal sales volumes for 2020 decreased 14,232 MBoe, or 11%, compared to 2019, reflecting reduced sales from the previously described production curtailments in the current year. For 2020, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 18% compared to 2019, while our natural gas sales volumes decreased 2%.\nOur crude oil net sales prices averaged $34.71 per barrel for 2020, a decrease of 33% compared to $51.82 per barrel for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and wider price differentials. The differential between NYMEX West Texas Intermediate calendar month crude oil prices and our realized crude oil net sales prices averaged $5.80 per barrel in 2020 compared to $5.15 per barrel in 2019. The increased differential reflects changes in supply and demand fundamentals and economic effects from COVID-19 that impacted location differentials and price realizations in the first and second quarters of 2020 compared to the prior year. Our crude oil net sales price differential to NYMEX averaged $5.20 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur natural gas net sales prices averaged $1.04 per Mcf for 2020, a 41% decrease compared to $1.77 per Mcf for 2019 due to significantly reduced market prices and lower price realizations. The discount between our net sales prices and NYMEX Henry Hub calendar month natural gas prices weakened to $1.10 per Mcf for 2020 compared to $0.86 per Mcf for 2019. We sell the majority of our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur. The field markets are impacted by residue gas and natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") prices at secondary, downstream markets. NGL prices decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 levels in conjunction with decreased crude oil prices and other factors, resulting in reduced price realizations for our natural gas sales stream relative to benchmark prices. As a result of the decrease in prices, under certain of our arrangements on operated properties the contractual pricing adjustments applied by midstream customers exceeded the sales consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the customers. Additionally, in some instances on non-operated properties the costs incurred by the outside operator exceeded the consideration we were entitled to receive, resulting in a net payment owed by us to the outside operator. The net amounts paid or payable under these arrangements on operated and non-operated properties totaled $42.9 million for 2020, and are reflected as a reduction of natural gas revenues and net sales prices. Nearly all of such amounts were associated with our North region natural gas production.\nDerivatives. Changes in market prices during 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives, which resulted in negative revenue adjustments of $14.7 million for the year, representing $28.2 million of cash losses partially offset by $13.5 million of unsettled non-cash gains. For 2019, we recognized positive revenue adjustments of $49.1 million resulting from changes in market prices that had a favorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives.\nCrude oil and natural gas service operations. Our crude oil and natural gas service operations consist primarily of revenues associated with water gathering, recycling, and disposal activities, which are impacted by our production volumes and the timing and extent of our drilling and completion projects. Revenues associated with such activities decreased $22.8 million, or 33%, from $68.5 million for 2019 to $45.7 million for 2020 due to reduced water handling activities resulting from our curtailment of production and reduced completion activities during the year. The decreased activities also resulted in a reduction in service-related expenses compared to the prior period.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nProduction expenses. Production expenses decreased $85.3 million, or 19%, to $359.3 million for 2020 compared to $444.6 million for 2019. This decrease resulted from reduced service costs being incurred in conjunction with production curtailments and cost control efforts, operating efficiency gains, and a higher portion of our production coming from wells in Oklahoma which typically have lower operating costs compared to wells in the Bakken, all of which led to a reduction in our production expenses to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019. Despite our production curtailments, we achieved sequential reductions in our per-Boe production expenses each quarter during 2020 and, as a result of our efficient operations and low-cost production growth in Oklahoma late in the year, our production expenses decreased to a notably low $2.80 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter.\nProduction taxes. Production taxes decreased $165.3 million, or 46%, to $192.7 million for 2020 compared to $358.0 million for 2019 due to a 43% decrease in crude oil and natural gas sales. Our production taxes as a percentage of net crude oil and natural gas sales averaged 8.2% for 2020, consistent with 8.3% for 2019.\nExploration expenses. Exploration expenses, which consist primarily of exploratory geological and geophysical costs and dry hole costs that are expensed as incurred, increased $3.0 million, or 21%, to $17.7 million for 2020 compared to $14.7 million for 2019 due to changes in the timing and extent of our exploration-related activities. The 2020 period includes $6.3 million of dry hole costs recognized in the first quarter associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well with no comparable dry hole costs incurred in 2019.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d). Total DD&A decreased $136.4 million, or 7%, to $1.88 billion for 2020 compared to $2.02 billion for 2019 due to an 11% decrease in total sales volumes, the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in our DD&A rate per Boe as further discussed below. The following table shows the components of our DD&A on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$/Boe </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and natural gas properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.03 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated proved reserves are a key component in our computation of DD&A expense. Proved reserves are determined using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months as required by SEC rules. Holding all other factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward due to commodity price declines or other reasons, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases. Conversely, if proved reserves are revised upward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense decreases.\nDownward revisions of proved reserves at year-end 2020 prompted by the significant decrease in average commodity prices and other factors resulted in an increase in our DD&A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties compared to 2019. As a result of these downward revisions, our DD&A increased to $19.01 per Boe for the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $16.45 per Boe for the 2019 fourth quarter, which contributed to the overall increase in our DD&A rate for the full year of 2020.\nNYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021 averaged $51.04 per barrel and $2.53 per MMBtu, respectively, which are notably higher than average prices in 2020. If commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period, upward price-related revisions of proved reserves may occur in the future, which may be significant and could result in a decrease in our DD&A rate relative to the 2020 fourth quarter. We are unable to predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on our future DD&A rate.\nProperty impairments. Property impairments increased $191.7 million to $277.9 million for 2020 compared to $86.2 million for 2019, primarily reflecting higher proved property impairments as described below.\nImpairments of proved oil and gas properties totaled $182.6 million for 2020, of which $181.0 million was recognized in the 2020 first quarter and $1.6 million was recognized in the 2020 third quarter, resulting from the significant decrease in commodity prices that indicated the carrying values for certain fields were not recoverable. The impairments were recognized on legacy properties in the Red River Units ($168.1 million) and various non-core properties in the North and South regions ($14.5 million). Additionally, in response to decreased crude oil prices, we recognized a $24.5 million impairment in the 2020 first quarter to reduce the value of our crude oil inventory to estimated net realizable value at the time of impairment. There were no significant proved property impairments recognized in 2019.\nImpairments of unproved properties decreased $11.7 million, or 14%, to $70.8 million in 2020 compared to $82.5 million in 2019 due to a reduction in the balance of unamortized leasehold costs over the past year.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses. G&A expenses totaled $196.6 million for 2020, consistent with $195.3 million for 2019 due to offsetting changes in equity compensation expenses and other G&A charges as described below.\nTotal G&A expenses include non-cash charges for equity compensation of $64.6 million and $52.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, the increase of which was due to additional grants of restricted stock awards coupled with higher forfeitures of unvested stock in 2019 that resulted in lower equity compensation expense for that period.\nG&A expenses other than equity compensation totaled $132.0 million for 2020, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 8%, compared to $143.3 million for 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee benefits and other efforts to reduce spending in response to significantly reduced commodity prices and economic turmoil from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower overhead recoveries from joint interest owners driven by reduced drilling, completion, and production activities.\nThe following table shows the components of G&A expenses on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$/Boe </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.15 </td>"}
