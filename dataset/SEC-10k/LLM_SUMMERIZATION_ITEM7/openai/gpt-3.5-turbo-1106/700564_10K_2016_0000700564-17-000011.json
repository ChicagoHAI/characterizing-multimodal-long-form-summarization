is a financial holding company comprised of six wholly owned banking subsidiaries which provide a full range of retail and commercial financial services in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. The Corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and/or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin, which is net interest income (fully taxable-equivalent, or \"FTE\") as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets, such as loans, investments and properties. Offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans, non-interest expenses and income taxes.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Corporation's earnings and selected performance ratios:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>7.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average tangible equity (1)\n</td> <td>10.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (2)\n</td> <td>3.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio (1)\n</td> <td>67.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets to total assets\n</td> <td>0.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized net charge-offs to average loans\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Ratio represents a financial measure derived by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").

See additional information regarding these critical accounting policies in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nAllowance for Credit Losses - The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management's estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Corporation's allowance for loan losses includes: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20.\nManagement's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio is based on a methodology that includes the following critical judgments:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of potential problem loans in a timely manner. For commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk rating categories is a significant component of the allowance for credit loss methodology for these loans, which bases the probability of default on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. The Corporation's loan review officers provide an independent assessment of risk rating accuracy. Ratings may be changed based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by loan officers or credit administration staff, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation does not assign internal risk ratings for residential mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, lease receivables, and construction loans to individuals secured by residential real estate, as these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk through the monitoring of delinquency status.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proper collateral valuation of impaired loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35. Substantially all of the Corporation's impaired loans to borrowers with total outstanding loan balances greater than or equal to $1.0 million are measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan's collateral. Collateral could be in the form of real estate, in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans, or business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, in the case of commercial loans. Commercial loans may also be secured by real property.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through appraisals performed by state certified third-party appraisers, discounted to arrive at expected net sale proceeds. For collateral-dependent loans, estimated real estate fair values are also net of estimated selling costs. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including: the age of the most recent appraisal; the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal; the condition of the property; the Corporation's experience and knowledge of the real estate market; the purpose of the loan; market factors; payment status; the strength of any guarantors; and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions, among others. The Corporation generally obtains updated state certified third-party appraisals for impaired loans secured predominately by real estate every 12 months.\nWhen updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35 that are secured by real estate, fair values are estimated based on the original appraisal values, as long as the original appraisal indicated a strong loan-to-value position and, in the opinion of the Corporation's internal credit administration staff, there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value since the original appraisal was performed. Original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value, as adjusted appropriately for the age of the appraisal, results in a current loan-to-value ratio that is lower than the Corporation's loan-to-value requirements for new loans, generally less than 70%.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20. For loan loss allocation purposes, loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics. These pools are established by general loan type, or \"portfolio segments,\" as presented in the table under the heading, \"Loans, net of unearned income,\" within \"Note 4 -Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial loans, class segments include loans secured by collateral and unsecured loans. Construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate. Consumer loan class segments are based on collateral types and include direct consumer installment loans and indirect automobile loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers are further segmented into separate pools based on internally assigned risk ratings. Residential mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, and lease receivables are further segmented into separate pools based on delinquency status.\nA loss rate is calculated for each pool through a migration analysis based on historical losses as loans migrate through the various risk rating or delinquency categories. Estimated loss rates are based on a probability of default and a loss given default. The loss rate is adjusted to consider qualitative factors, such as economic conditions and trends.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overall assessment of the risk profile of the loan portfolio. The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio. The Corporation considers risk factors such as: local and national economic conditions; trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans; the diversity of borrower industry types; and the composition of the portfolio by loan type. An unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date, but are not specifically identifiable, and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For additional details related to the allowance for credit losses, see \"Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nGoodwill - Goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions is not amortized to expense, but is tested at least annually for impairment. A quantitative annual impairment test is not required if, based on a qualitative analysis, the Corporation determines that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired. The Corporation\ncompletes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31st of each year. The Corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities, as necessary, to defined reporting units. A fair value is then determined for each reporting unit. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of the recorded goodwill through an impairment charge to non-interest expense is necessary. If the fair values are less than the book values, an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill.\nReporting unit valuation is inherently subjective, with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments. Among these are future growth rates for the reporting units, selection of comparable market transactions, discount rates and earnings capitalization rates. Changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions, industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges.\nFor additional details related to the annual goodwill impairment test, see \"Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIncome Taxes - The provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses and credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nThe Corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. If any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered, a valuation allowance must be recognized. The assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions, changes in which could have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.\nOn a periodic basis, the Corporation evaluates its income tax positions based on tax laws, regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. Recognition and measurement of tax positions is based upon management's evaluations of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Corporation's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions and the overall tax environment.\nFor additional details see \"Note 12 - Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nFair Value Measurements - FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value based on the following three categories (from highest to lowest priority):\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or quoted prices for identical instruments in non-active markets. Also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices, such as interest rates or other market-corroborated means.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Inputs that are largely unobservable, as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels.\nThe determination of fair value for assets categorized as Level 3 items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs. In addition, determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management's judgment. The Corporation's Level 3 assets include available for sale debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities, certain single-issuer trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and auction rate securities. The Corporation also categorizes impaired loans, net of allowance allocations, other real estate owned (\"OREO\") and mortgage servicing rights as Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nThe Corporation engages third-party valuation experts to assist in valuing interest rate swap derivatives and most available-for-sale investment securities, both measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and mortgage servicing rights, which are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The pricing data and market quotes the Corporation obtains from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness.\nFor additional details see \"Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for the disclosures required by FASB ASC Topic 820.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a description of new accounting standards issued, but not yet adopted by the Corporation, see \"New Accounting Standards,\" in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of the Corporation's net income. The Corporation manages the risk associated with changes in interest rates through the techniques described within Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nThe following table provides a comparative average balance sheet and net interest income analysis for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014. Interest income and yields are presented on an FTE basis, using a 35% federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances.

This increase was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in FTE interest income as a result of a 9 basis point, or 2.2%, decline in the average yield on the loan portfolio. The increase in average loans was driven largely by growth in the commercial mortgage, commercial loan, construction, residential mortgage and leasing portfolios. The commercial mortgage growth was realized in all\ngeographic markets, but largely in Pennsylvania. The decrease in average yields on loans was attributable to repayments of higher-yielding loans, refinancing activity at lower rates, and new loan production at rates lower than the overall portfolio yield.\nAverage investment securities increased $121.8 million, or 5.2%, in comparison to 2015. The average yield on investment securities decreased 5 basis points, or 2.0%, to 2.45% in 2016 from 2.50% in 2015. Other interest earning assets decreased $39.9 million, or 8.9%.\nInterest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 1.8%, to $82.3 million in 2016 from $83.8 million in 2015, despite an increase in total average interest-bearing liabilities of $519.8 million, or 4.6%, compared to 2015. The impact of the increase in average balances of interest-bearing liabilities was more than offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the average cost of these interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease resulted from a shift in funding mix that was more concentrated in lower-cost deposits and short-term borrowings, as well as the impact of long-term debt refinancing activities.\nAverage

increase in Federal funds purchased. Total long-term debt decreased $64.8 million as the result of maturing FHLB advances and the maturity of $100.0 million of subordinated debt in April 2015.\nThe cost of average short-term borrowings increased 10 basis points, to 0.21% in 2016, largely due to the Federal Reserve System (FRB) increasing the Federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points in December 2015. The cost of average long-term debt decreased 36 basis points, to 3.83% in 2016, as the result of certain refinancing activities for FHLB advances and other long-term debt.\nIn June 2015, the Corporation issued $150 million of subordinated debt at an effective rate of 4.69%. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem $150 million of trust preferred securities, with an effective rate of 6.52%, in July 2015.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Corporation executed two transactions to restructure its long-term FHLB advances. First, $200 million of FHLB advances, with a weighted average rate of 4.45% and maturing in the first quarter of 2017, were refinanced with new advances maturing from September 2019 to December 2020, at a weighted average rate of 2.95%. This transaction reduced interest expense on a quarterly basis by approximately $750,000, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Second, forward agreements were executed to refinance an additional $200 million of FHLB advances which matured in December 2016. These forward agreements have maturity dates from March 2021 to December 2021 and will reduce the weighted average rate on these advances from 4.03% to 2.40% and decrease interest expense on a quarterly basis by approximately $800,000 beginning in the first quarter of 2017.\nComparison of 2015 to 2014\nFTE net interest income decreased $13.9 million, or 2.6%, to $518.5 million in 2015. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points, or 5.3%, to 3.21% in 2014 from 3.39% in 2014.\nFTE interest income decreased $11.3 million, or 1.8%, as average yields on interest-earning assets decreased 18 basis points. This decrease in yields resulted in a $27.7 million decrease in FTE interest income, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in FTE interest income as a result of a $443.7 million, or 2.8%, increase in average interest-earning assets.\nAverage loans and average FTE yields, by type, are summarized in the following table:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in Balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial mortgage\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,117,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial - industrial, financial and agricultural\n</td> <td>3,882,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,659,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - home equity\n</td> <td>1,700,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,738,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,598\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential mortgage\n</td> <td>1,371,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,355,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction\n</td> <td>726,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>265,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,165\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and other\n</td> <td>137,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,330,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,885,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall loan growth in 2015 resulted from an increase in business activity in the Corporation's markets. This growth was realized mainly in commercial loans and commercial mortgages, which realized a combined increase of $352.6 million, or 4.0%.\nThe average yield on loans during 2015 of 4.04% represented a 17 basis point, or 4.0%, decrease in comparison to 2014. The decrease in average yields on loans was attributable to yields on new loans being lower than the overall portfolio yield.\nAverage investment securities decreased $137.5 million, or 5.5%, in comparison to 2014, as portfolio cash flows were not fully reinvested. The average yield on investment securities decreased 16 basis points, or 6.0%, to 2.50% in 2015 from 2.66% in 2014. Other interest-earning assets increased $133.0 million, or 42.3%. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Corporation changed providers for check clearing services to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, resulting in the transfer of clearing account balances from noninterest earning assets to low-yielding interest-bearing Federal Reserve Bank accounts, which contributed to the 21 basis points, or 16.4%, decrease in the average yield on other interest-earning assets.\nInterest expense increased $2.6 million, or 3.2%, to $83.8 million in 2015 from $81.2 million in 2014, mainly due to a change in funding mix from lower-cost short-term Federal funds purchased and short-term FHLB advances to higher-cost deposits and long-term FHLB advances. As a result of these funding changes, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 2 basis points. Total interest-bearing liabilities increased $31.5 million, or 0.3%. Additional funding to support the increase in interest-earning assets was provided by a $397.3 million, or 11.6%, increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nAverage deposits and interest rates,

in the Corporation's funding position as increases in average deposits and decreases in average investments outpaced the growth in average interest-earning assets. The $58.4 million increase in long-term debt was primarily due to additional long-term FHLB advances. The average cost of total borrowings increased 65 basis points, or 25.4%, to 3.21% in 2015 from 2.56% in 2014, primarily due to the change in funding mix. While total borrowings decreased $450.7 million, or 25.1%, the percentage of lower-cost short-term borrowings decreased from 46.3% of the total in 2014 to 24.0% in 2015. This change in the funding mix resulted from the improvement in the Corporation's overall liquidity position and the shift from short-term borrowings to deposits. See the discussion of long-term debt refinancing activities in the \"Comparison of 2016 to 2015\" section.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses was $13.2 million in 2016, an increase of $10.9 million in comparison to 2015. The provision for credit losses for 2015 was $2.3 million, a decrease of $10.3 million in comparison to 2014.\nThe provision for credit losses is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income and is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to its appropriate balance, as determined through the Corporation's allowance methodology. The Corporation determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including, but not limited to: the size and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in risk ratings, changes in collateral values, delinquency levels, historical losses and economic conditions. See further discussion of the Corporation's allowance methodology under the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies\" above.

on personal accounts and a $214,000 increase in fees assessed\non commercial accounts, due to higher volumes. Cash management fees increased $841,000, or 6.3%, compared to 2015 due to higher transaction volumes and fee increases implemented in 2016.\nThe $1.1 million, or 7.3%, increase in merchant fee income, the $488,000, or 4.5%, increase in debit card income and the $614,000, or 6.4%, increase in credit card income were all due to increases in the volumes of transactions in comparison to 2015.\nThe $6.0 million increase in commercial loan interest rate swap fees was due to growth in commercial loans and the attractiveness of interest rate swaps in the current rate environment, whereby borrowers executed swaps to lock in fixed rates, while the Corporation continues to earn a floating rate. See \"Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional details.\nThe $1.2 million, or 2.8%, increase in investment management and trust services income reflected a $1.6 million, or 6.4%, increase\nin trust commissions and money market income, partially offset by a $355,000, or 1.8%, decrease in brokerage fees. The increase in trust commission income was driven by a 9.3% in increase assets under management, as well as improvements in market values of existing assets.\nGains on sales of mortgage loans increased $2.4 million, or 18.3%, due to a 23.7% increase in pricing spreads compared to the prior year, partially offset by a $43.3 million, or 4.4%, decrease in new loan volumes. Mortgage servicing income decreased $1.2 million, or 24.6%, mainly due to a $1.3 million net valuation allowance recognized in 2016.

The average number of full-time equivalent employees increased\nto 3,490 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 3,460 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Benefits expenses increased $3.7 million, or 8.9%, due to an increase in health care expense, employer contributions to the Corporation's 401(k) retirement plan, defined benefit plan expense, employee education and other employee benefits.\nThe $3.9 million, or 14.0%, decrease in other outside services in comparison to 2015 was due to lower expenses associated with the Corporation's BSA/AML compliance program remediation efforts, and lower costs for information technology and human resources initiatives.\nThe $2.2 million, or 14.6%, increase in software resulted from investments in technology, which are reflected in higher amortization, as well as increases in maintenance costs.\nEquipment expense decreased $1.7 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to lower depreciation expense, as certain assets became fully depreciated. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.7 million, or 14.8%, due to a reduction in the assessment rate beginning in the the third quarter of 2016. Other real estate owned and repossession expense decreased $1.7 million, or 46.9%, when compared to 2015, due to lower holding costs and an increase in net gains on sales. This expense category can experience volatility from period to period based on the timing of foreclosures and sales of properties and payments of expenses.\nIn July 2015, the Corporation redeemed $150.0 million of TruPS. In connection with this redemption, a loss of $5.6 million was\nrecognized as a component of non-interest expense with no comparable expense in 2016.\nOther non-interest expense increased $1.5 million mainly as a result of $1.8 million of property write downs related to a branch closure and the reconfiguration of a building as part of a long-term facilities plan.\nComparison of 2015 to

$449,000, or 2.3%, decrease in brokerage revenue and a $131,000, or 0.5%, decrease in trust commissions. These decreases resulted from a downturn in market conditions which decreased the values of existing assets under management in trust, wealth management, and brokerage managed accounts.\nTotal service charges on deposit accounts increased $804,000, or 1.6%. Improvements were seen in other service charges on deposits ($816,000, or 5.7%, increase) due to growth in balances, and cash management fees ($633,000, or 5.0%, increase) due to changes in fee structures. These increases were partially offset by a $645,000, or 2.9%, decrease in overdraft fees due to lower volumes resulting from changes in customer behavior.\nThe $1.2 million, or 8.8%, increase in merchant fee income, the $800,000, or 8.0%, increase in debit card income and the $461,000, or 5.0%, increase in credit card income were largely driven by higher transaction volumes. Commercial interest rate swap fees increased $1.9 million, or 52.6%, due to higher commercial loan origination volumes.\nGains on sales of mortgage loans increased $3.2 million, or 31.8%, due to a $136.4 million, or 16.1%, increase in new loan commitments and a 13.5% increase in pricing spreads compared to 2014. The increase in new loan commitments was largely in refinancing volumes, which were $479.2 million, or 48.7%, of total new loan commitments in 2015 compared to $277.5 million, or 32.7%, in 2014. Mortgage servicing income decreased $2.1 million, or 29.8%, due to an increase in amortization of mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), as prepayments increased when compared to 2014.\nThe $1.5 million, or 28.9%, increase in other income was due to higher gains on sales of fixed assets, primarily former branch properties, in 2015.\nInvestment securities gains of $9.1 million in 2015 were a result of $6.5 million of net realized gains on the sales of financial institution stocks and $2.6 million of net realized gains on the sales of debt securities. Investment securities gains of $2.0 million for 2014 were the net result of $1.7 million of net realized gains on the sales of debt securities and $335,000 of net realized gains on the sales of financial institution stocks.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy expense\n</td> <td>47,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(353\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other outside services\n</td> <td>27,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>19,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software\n</td> <td>14,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment expense\n</td> <td>14,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance\n</td> <td>11,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>11,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(853\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplies and postage\n</td> <td>10,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing\n</td> <td>7,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunications\n</td> <td>6,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on redemption of trust preferred securities\n</td> <td>5,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO and repossession expense\n</td> <td>3,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating risk loss\n</td> <td>3,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible amortization\n</td> <td>247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,012\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>34,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>459,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $9.8 million, or 3.9%, with salaries increasing $8.4 million, or 4.0%, and employee benefits increasing $1.4 million, or 3.6%. The increase in salaries was primarily due to higher average salaries per full-time equivalent employee, an increase in incentive compensation, and higher temporary employee expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the average number of full-time equivalent employees to 3,460 in 2015, compared to 3,530 in 2014. The increase in employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in defined benefit plan expense in 2015, while 2014 included a $1.5 million gain realized on a post-retirement plan amendment.\nThe $4.7 million, or 15.8%, combined increase in data processing and software resulted from higher transaction volumes, contractual increases in third-party service provider costs, and the implementation of additional systems.\nOther outside services expenses remained elevated in 2015, decreasing a modest $619,000, or 2.2%, from 2014. The $947,000, or 7.0%, increase in equipment expense was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense on new office furniture and equipment. FDIC insurance expense increased $512,000, or 4.7%, as a result of balance sheet growth. Professional fees, consisting of legal and audit fees, decreased $853,000, or 7.1%, due to a combination of lower loan workout legal costs and lower corporate legal fees. Marketing expense decreased $809,000, or 9.9%, as fewer promotional campaigns were executed in 2015.\nThe $360,000, or 11.0%, decrease in other real estate owned and repossession expense was primarily due to lower repossession expense in 2015. This expense category can experience volatility from period to period based on the timing of foreclosures and sales of properties and payments of expenses, such as real estate taxes.\nThe $647,000, or 15.1%, decrease in operating risk loss was due to a $1.3 million decrease in check card fraud losses, partially offset by an $817,000 increase in losses associated with previously sold residential mortgages. See \"Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional details related to repurchases of previously sold residential mortgages.\nIntangible amortization decreased $1.0 million, as core deposit intangible assets recognized from previous acquisitions were largely amortized and net book values were approaching $0.\nIn July 2015, the Corporation redeemed $150.0 million of TruPS. In connection with this redemption, a loss of $5.6 million, consisting of the remaining unamortized issuance and hedge costs, was recognized as a component of non-interest expense.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2016 was $46.6 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 6.6%, from 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in tax credit investments and tax-exempt income, partially offset by the 4.4% increase in income before income taxes. Income tax expense for 2015 decreased $2.7 million, or 5.1%, from 2014. The Corporation's effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) was 22.4% in 2016 and 25.0% in both 2015 and 2014.\nThe Corporation's effective tax rates are lower than the 35% federal statutory rate due mainly to investments in tax-free state and municipal securities and federal tax credits earned from investments in certain community development projects that generate tax credits under various Federal programs (\"Tax Credit Investments\"), partially offset by the impact of state income taxes. Net credits associated with Tax Credit Investments were $14.6 million in 2016 and $10.4 million in both 2015 and 2014.\nFor additional information regarding income taxes, see \"Note 12 - Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe table below presents condensed consolidated ending

3.0%, to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2016, mainly in mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities, partially offset by a decrease in collateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations decreased $227.6 million, or 27.7%, as the Corporation reduced its holdings in lower coupon investments due to volatility in market pricing. The $3.0 million, or 14.0%, increase in equity securities reflects an increase in unrealized gains on financial institutions stocks. The net pre-tax unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities was $35.0 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to a $9.3 million net pre-tax unrealized loss as of December 31, 2015. The change was due to an increase in market interest rates, which resulted in lower fair values for debt securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities.\nLoans\nThe following table presents loans outstanding, by type, as of the dates shown, and the changes in balances for the most recent year:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015 Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial mortgage\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,018,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,462,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,197,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,101,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,664,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial - industrial, financial and agricultural\n</td> <td>4,087,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,088,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,725,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,628,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,612,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - home equity\n</td> <td>1,625,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,684,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,736,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,764,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,632,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,324\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential mortgage\n</td> <td>1,601,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,376,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,377,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,337,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,257,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction\n</td> <td>843,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>291,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing, other and overdrafts\n</td> <td>250,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross loans\n</td> <td>14,718,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,854,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,124,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,792,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,154,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>864,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned income\n</td> <td>(19,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, net of unearned income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,699,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,838,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,111,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,782,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,146,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation does not have a concentration of credit risk with any single borrower, industry or geographic location within its footprint. Approximately $6.9 billion, or 46.7%, of the loan portfolio was in commercial mortgage and construction loans as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation's policies limit the maximum total lending commitment to an individual borrower to $50.0 million. In addition, the Corporation has established lower total lending limits for certain types of lending commitments, and lower total lending limits based on the Corporation's internal risk rating of an individual borrower at the time the lending commitment is approved. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had 122 relationships with total borrowing commitments between $20.0 million and $50.0 million.\nCommercial mortgage loans increased $556.3 million, or 10.2%, in comparison to December 31, 2015 across all markets, but primarily in Pennsylvania. Residential mortgages increased $225.8 million, or 16.4%, across all markets, except Delaware. The increase in residential mortgages resulted from a strategic decision to originate and retain certain jumbo mortgage loans and loans that enhance the Corporation's compliance with Community Reinvestment Act requirements.\nThe following table summarizes the industry concentrations within the commercial loan portfolio as of December 31:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction (1)\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate (2)\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arts and entertainment\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial services\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes commercial loans to borrowers engaged in the construction industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes commercial loans to borrowers engaged in the business of: renting, leasing or managing real estate for others; selling and/or buying real estate for others; and appraising real estate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans also include shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more banks.

For commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used to monitor credit quality. For a complete description of the Corporation's risk ratings, refer to the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" section within \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The evaluation of credit risk for residential mortgages, home equity loans, construction loans to individuals, consumer loans and lease receivables is based on aggregate payment history, through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends.\nTotal internally risk rated loans were $10.9 billion and $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The $20.5 million decrease in FHLB advances was due to maturing advances that were not refinanced.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities increased $46.2 million, or 15.8%, to $339.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a $30.9 million increase in commitments to fund Tax Credit Investments and an $8.4 million increase in the fair value of commercial loan interest rate swaps.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $79.2 million, or 3.9%, to $2.1 billion, or 11.2%, of total assets, as of December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to $161.6 million of net income and $17.1 million of common stock issued, partially offset by $18.5 million of common stock repurchases, a $16.4 million net decrease accumulated other comprehensive loss, mainly available for sale securities, and $71.1 million of dividends on common shares outstanding.\nIn November 2016, the Corporation's board of directors approved an extension, through December 31, 2017, to a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Corporation is authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 2.3% of its outstanding shares. During 2016, approximately 1.5 million shares were repurchased through this program for a total cost of $18.5 million, or $12.48 per share. Up to an additional $31.5 million of the Corporation's common stock may be repurchased under this program through December 31, 2017.\nThe Corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Corporation's financial statements. The regulations require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, Tier I and Common Equity Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and Tier I capital to average assets (as defined).\nThe following table summarizes the Corporation's capital ratios in comparison to regulatory requirements at December 31:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory\nMinimum\nfor Capital\nAdequacy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fully Phased-in, with Capital Conservation Buffers\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>13.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier I capital (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier I (to risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>10.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier I capital (to average assets)\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn July 2013, the FRB approved final rules (the \"U.S. Basel III Capital Rules\") establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions.\nThe minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019.\nThe U.S. Basel III Capital Rules require the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries to:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Meet a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% of risk-weighted assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continue to require a minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.00% of average assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Comply with a revised definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses as a result of which certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, will be excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation's size.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries will also be required to maintain a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments.\nThe U.S. Basel III Capital Rules use a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weightings for assets and off balance sheet exposures from the current 0%, 20%, 50% and 100% categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets and off-balance sheet exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum requirements of the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, and each of the Corporation's bank subsidiaries' capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered \"well capitalized\" as defined in the regulations. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation's capital levels also met the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffers, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules.

These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"Management's Discussion\") relates to Fulton Financial Corporation (the \"Corporation\"), a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1982, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Management's Discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information presented in this report.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Corporation has made, and may continue to make, certain forward-looking statements with respect to its financial condition and results of operations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"future,\" \"intends\" and similar expressions which are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Corporation's control and ability to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The Corporation undertakes no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Many factors could affect future financial results including, without limitation:\n \u2022 the impact of adverse conditions in the economy and capital markets on the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolio and demand for the Corporation's products and services; \n \u2022 increases in non-performing assets, which may require the Corporation to increase the allowance for credit losses, charge off loans and incur elevated collection and carrying costs related to such non-performing assets; \n \u2022 investment securities gains and losses, including other-than-temporary declines in the value of securities which may result in charges to earnings; \n \u2022 the effects of market interest rates, and the relative balances of interest rate-sensitive assets to interest rate-sensitive liabilities, on net interest margin and net interest income; \n \u2022 the effects of changes in interest rates on demand for the Corporation's products and services; \n \u2022 the effects of changes in interest rates or disruptions in liquidity markets on the Corporation's sources of funding; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to manage liquidity, both at the holding company level and at its bank subsidiaries; \n \u2022 the impact of increased regulatory scrutiny of the banking industry; \n \u2022 the effects of the increasing amounts of time and expense associated with regulatory compliance and risk management; \n \u2022 the potential for negative consequences from regulatory violations and investigations, including potential supervisory actions and the assessment of fines and penalties; \n \u2022 the additional time, expense and investment required to comply with, and the restrictions on potential growth and investment activities resulting from, the existing enforcement orders applicable to the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries by federal and state bank regulatory agencies requiring improvement in compliance functions and other remedial actions, or any future enforcement orders; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to manage the uncertainty associated with the delay in implementing many of the regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act; \n \u2022 the effects of, and uncertainty surrounding, potential changes in legislation, regulation and government policy as a result of the recent change in federal administration; \n \u2022 the effects of negative publicity on the Corporation's reputation; \n \u2022 the effects of adverse outcomes in litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings; \n \u2022 the potential to incur losses in connection with repurchase and indemnification payments related to sold loans; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to successfully transform its business model; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to achieve its growth plans; \n \u2022 the effects of competition on deposit rates and growth, loan rates and growth and net interest margin; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to manage the level of non-interest expenses, including salaries and employee benefits expenses, operating risk losses and goodwill impairment; \n \u2022 the effects of changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations; \n \u2022 the impact of operational risks, including the risk of human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, computer and telecommunications systems failures, faulty or incomplete data and an inadequate risk management framework; \n \u2022 the impact of failures of third parties upon which the Corporation relies to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements; \n \u2022 the failure or circumvention of the Corporation's system of internal controls; \n \u2022 the loss of, or failure to safeguard, confidential or proprietary information; \n \u2022 the Corporation's failure to identify and to address cyber-security risks; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to keep pace with technological changes; \n \u2022 the Corporation's ability to attract and retain talented personnel; \n \u2022 capital and liquidity strategies, including the Corporation's ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, and the Corporation's ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; \n \u2022 the Corporation's reliance on its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenues and its ability to pay dividends or other distributions; and \n \u2022 the effects of any downgrade in the Corporation's credit ratings on its borrowing costs or access to capital markets. \nOVERVIEW\nThe Corporation is a financial holding company comprised of six wholly owned banking subsidiaries which provide a full range of retail and commercial financial services in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. The Corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and/or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin, which is net interest income (fully taxable-equivalent, or \"FTE\") as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets, such as loans, investments and properties. Offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans, non-interest expenses and income taxes.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Corporation's earnings and selected performance ratios:\n\n (1) Ratio represents a financial measure derived by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). See reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure under the heading, \"Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Based Financial Measures,\" in Item 6. Selected Financial Data. \n (2) Presented on an FTE basis, using a 35% Federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances. See also the \"Net Interest Income\" section of Management's Discussion. \nFollowing is a summary of the financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Net Income Per Share Growth - Diluted net income per share increased $0.08, or 9.4%, to $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $0.85 in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in net income of $12.1 million, or 8.1%, and a 2.4 million, or 1.3%, decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding in comparison to 2015. The increase in net income was driven by a $20.8 million, or 4.2%, increase in net interest income and a $14.9 million, or 8.6%, increase in non-interest income, excluding investment securities gains, partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses, a $9.4 million, or 1.9%, increase in non-interest expense and a $6.5 million, or 71.9%, decrease in investment securities gains. \n \u2022 Net Interest Income Growth - The $20.8 million increase in net interest income resulted from the impact of growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a lower net interest margin. \n \u25e6 Net Interest Margin - For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, or 0.9%, in comparison to 2015, driven by a 7 basis point decrease in yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n \u25e6 Loan Growth - Average loans increased $797.1 million, or 6.0%, in comparison to 2015, with notable increases in commercial mortgages, commercial - industrial, financial and agricultural, and construction loans. The Corporation's loan growth occurred throughout most of its markets. \n \u25e6 Deposit Growth - Average deposits increased $838.4 million, or 6.1%, in comparison to 2015. The increase was the result of growth in demand and savings accounts, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Average deposit growth outpaced loan growth, which enhanced the Corporation's funding position. At December 31, 2016, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 97.9%, which was relatively flat compared to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Asset Quality - Overall asset quality continued to improve in 2016, with decreases in net charge-offs, non-performing loans and overall delinquency levels. The $10.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Non-Interest Income - Non-interest income, excluding securities gains, increased $14.9 million, or 8.6%, in comparison to 2015, primarily driven by a $7.5 million, or 17.0%, increase in other service charges and fees. \n \u2022 Non-Interest Expense - Non-interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 1.9%, in comparison to 2015, driven largely by a $22.5 million, or 8.6%, increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $2.3 million, or 6.6% increase in software and data processing expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other expense categories, as discussed in the \"Non-Interest Expense\" section. \n \u2022 Income Taxes - Income tax expense for 2016 reflected an effective tax rate (\"ETR\") of 22.4%, as compared to 25.0% for 2015. The decrease in the ETR resulted from increases in tax credit investments and related net tax credits earned and tax-exempt income. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of those accounting policies that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, as they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See additional information regarding these critical accounting policies in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nAllowance for Credit Losses - The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management's estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Corporation's allowance for loan losses includes: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20.\nManagement's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio is based on a methodology that includes the following critical judgments:\n \u2022 Identification of potential problem loans in a timely manner. For commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk rating categories is a significant component of the allowance for credit loss methodology for these loans, which bases the probability of default on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. The Corporation's loan review officers provide an independent assessment of risk rating accuracy. Ratings may be changed based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by loan officers or credit administration staff, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan. \nThe Corporation does not assign internal risk ratings for residential mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, lease receivables, and construction loans to individuals secured by residential real estate, as these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk through the monitoring of delinquency status.\n \u2022 Proper collateral valuation of impaired loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35. Substantially all of the Corporation's impaired loans to borrowers with total outstanding loan balances greater than or equal to $1.0 million are measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan's collateral. Collateral could be in the form of real estate, in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans, or business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, in the case of commercial loans. Commercial loans may also be secured by real property.  For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through appraisals performed by state certified third-party appraisers, discounted to arrive at expected net sale proceeds. For collateral-dependent loans, estimated real estate fair values are also net of estimated selling costs. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including: the age of the most recent appraisal; the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal; the condition of the property; the Corporation's experience and knowledge of the real estate market; the purpose of the loan; market factors; payment status; the strength of any guarantors; and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions, among others. The Corporation generally obtains updated state certified third-party appraisals for impaired loans secured predominately by real estate every 12 months.\nWhen updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35 that are secured by real estate, fair values are estimated based on the original appraisal values, as long as the original appraisal indicated a strong loan-to-value position and, in the opinion of the Corporation's internal credit administration staff, there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value since the original appraisal was performed. Original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value, as adjusted appropriately for the age of the appraisal, results in a current loan-to-value ratio that is lower than the Corporation's loan-to-value requirements for new loans, generally less than 70%.\n \u2022 Proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20. For loan loss allocation purposes, loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics. These pools are established by general loan type, or \"portfolio segments,\" as presented in the table under the heading, \"Loans, net of unearned income,\" within \"Note 4 -Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial loans, class segments include loans secured by collateral and unsecured loans. Construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate.

A quantitative annual impairment test is not required if, based on a qualitative analysis, the Corporation determines that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired. The Corporation\ncompletes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31st of each year. The Corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities, as necessary, to defined reporting units. A fair value is then determined for each reporting unit. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of the recorded goodwill through an impairment charge to non-interest expense is necessary. If the fair values are less than the book values, an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill.\nReporting unit valuation is inherently subjective, with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments. Among these are future growth rates for the reporting units, selection of comparable market transactions, discount rates and earnings capitalization rates. Changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions, industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges.\nFor additional details related to the annual goodwill impairment test, see \"Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIncome Taxes - The provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses and credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nThe Corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. If any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered, a valuation allowance must be recognized. The assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions, changes in which could have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.\nOn a periodic basis, the Corporation evaluates its income tax positions based on tax laws, regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. Recognition and measurement of tax positions is based upon management's evaluations of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Corporation's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions and the overall tax environment.\nFor additional details see \"Note 12 - Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nFair Value Measurements - FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value based on the following three categories (from highest to lowest priority):\n \u2022 Level 1 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or quoted prices for identical instruments in non-active markets. Also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices, such as interest rates or other market-corroborated means. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Inputs that are largely unobservable, as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued.  The Corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels.\nThe determination of fair value for assets categorized as Level 3 items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs. In addition, determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management's judgment.

The Corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and/or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin, which is net interest income (fully taxable-equivalent, or \"FTE\") as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets, such as loans, investments and properties. Offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans, non-interest expenses and income taxes.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Corporation's earnings and selected performance ratios:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>7.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average tangible equity (1)\n</td> <td>10.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (2)\n</td> <td>3.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio (1)\n</td> <td>67.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets to total assets\n</td> <td>0.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized net charge-offs to average loans\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Ratio represents a financial measure derived by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").

See also the \"Net Interest Income\" section of Management's Discussion. \nFollowing is a summary of the financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Net Income Per Share Growth - Diluted net income per share increased $0.08, or 9.4%, to $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $0.85 in 2015. This increase was due to an increase in net income of $12.1 million, or 8.1%, and a 2.4 million, or 1.3%, decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding in comparison to 2015. The increase in net income was driven by a $20.8 million, or 4.2%, increase in net interest income and a $14.9 million, or 8.6%, increase in non-interest income, excluding investment securities gains, partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses, a $9.4 million, or 1.9%, increase in non-interest expense and a $6.5 million, or 71.9%, decrease in investment securities gains. \n \u2022 Net Interest Income Growth - The $20.8 million increase in net interest income resulted from the impact of growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a lower net interest margin. \n \u25e6 Net Interest Margin - For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, or 0.9%, in comparison to 2015, driven by a 7 basis point decrease in yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n \u25e6 Loan Growth - Average loans increased $797.1 million, or 6.0%, in comparison to 2015, with notable increases in commercial mortgages, commercial - industrial, financial and agricultural, and construction loans. The Corporation's loan growth occurred throughout most of its markets. \n \u25e6 Deposit Growth - Average deposits increased $838.4 million, or 6.1%, in comparison to 2015. The increase was the result of growth in demand and savings accounts, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Average deposit growth outpaced loan growth, which enhanced the Corporation's funding position. At December 31, 2016, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 97.9%, which was relatively flat compared to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Asset Quality - Overall asset quality continued to improve in 2016, with decreases in net charge-offs, non-performing loans and overall delinquency levels. The $10.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Non-Interest Income - Non-interest income, excluding securities gains, increased $14.9 million, or 8.6%, in comparison to 2015, primarily driven by a $7.5 million, or 17.0%, increase in other service charges and fees. \n \u2022 Non-Interest Expense - Non-interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 1.9%, in comparison to 2015, driven largely by a $22.5 million, or 8.6%, increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $2.3 million, or 6.6% increase in software and data processing expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other expense categories, as discussed in the \"Non-Interest Expense\" section. \n \u2022 Income Taxes - Income tax expense for 2016 reflected an effective tax rate (\"ETR\") of 22.4%, as compared to 25.0% for 2015. The decrease in the ETR resulted from increases in tax credit investments and related net tax credits earned and tax-exempt income. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of those accounting policies that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, as they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See additional information regarding these critical accounting policies in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nAllowance for Credit Losses - The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management's estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Corporation's allowance for loan losses includes: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20.\nManagement's estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio is based on a methodology that includes the following critical judgments:\n \u2022 Identification of potential problem loans in a timely manner. For commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk rating categories is a significant component of the allowance for credit loss methodology for these loans, which bases the probability of default on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. The Corporation's loan review officers provide an independent assessment of risk rating accuracy. Ratings may be changed based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by loan officers or credit administration staff, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan. \nThe Corporation does not assign internal risk ratings for residential mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, lease receivables, and construction loans to individuals secured by residential real estate, as these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances. Instead, these portfolios are evaluated for risk through the monitoring of delinquency status.\n \u2022 Proper collateral valuation of impaired loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35. Substantially all of the Corporation's impaired loans to borrowers with total outstanding loan balances greater than or equal to $1.0 million are measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan's collateral. Collateral could be in the form of real estate, in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans, or business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, in the case of commercial loans. Commercial loans may also be secured by real property.  For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through appraisals performed by state certified third-party appraisers, discounted to arrive at expected net sale proceeds. For collateral-dependent loans, estimated real estate fair values are also net of estimated selling costs. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including: the age of the most recent appraisal; the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal; the condition of the property; the Corporation's experience and knowledge of the real estate market; the purpose of the loan; market factors; payment status; the strength of any guarantors; and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions, among others. The Corporation generally obtains updated state certified third-party appraisals for impaired loans secured predominately by real estate every 12 months.\nWhen updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Section 310-10-35 that are secured by real estate, fair values are estimated based on the original appraisal values, as long as the original appraisal indicated a strong loan-to-value position and, in the opinion of the Corporation's internal credit administration staff, there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value since the original appraisal was performed. Original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value, as adjusted appropriately for the age of the appraisal, results in a current loan-to-value ratio that is lower than the Corporation's loan-to-value requirements for new loans, generally less than 70%.\n \u2022 Proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20. For loan loss allocation purposes, loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics. These pools are established by general loan type, or \"portfolio segments,\" as presented in the table under the heading, \"Loans, net of unearned income,\" within \"Note 4 -Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial loans, class segments include loans secured by collateral and unsecured loans. Construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate. Consumer loan class segments are based on collateral types and include direct consumer installment loans and indirect automobile loans.  Commercial loans, commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers are further segmented into separate pools based on internally assigned risk ratings. Residential mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, and lease receivables are further segmented into separate pools based on delinquency status.\nA loss rate is calculated for each pool through a migration analysis based on historical losses as loans migrate through the various risk rating or delinquency categories. Estimated loss rates are based on a probability of default and a loss given default. The loss rate is adjusted to consider qualitative factors, such as economic conditions and trends.\n \u2022 Overall assessment of the risk profile of the loan portfolio. The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio. The Corporation considers risk factors such as: local and national economic conditions; trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans; the diversity of borrower industry types; and the composition of the portfolio by loan type. An unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date, but are not specifically identifiable, and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure.  For additional details related to the allowance for credit losses, see \"Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nGoodwill - Goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions is not amortized to expense, but is tested at least annually for impairment.
