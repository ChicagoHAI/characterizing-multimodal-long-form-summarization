The Conversion was completed on July 8, 1998.\nFrom August 8, 2008 until July 2, 2013, United Community was subject to an Order to Cease and Desist, as amended, and from July 9, 2013 to January 8, 2014 a Memorandum of Understanding. The Order and Memorandum of Understanding generally restricted United Community's ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or issue debt without the FRB's (as successor to the Office of Thrift Supervision) prior approval.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nTotal assets increased 8.4% to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. Contributing to the change were increases in net loans, loans held for sale and cash surrender value of life insurance. These changes were offset by decreases in securities, real estate owned and other repossessed assets and other assets. Total liabilities increased 9.4% to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015. This change was primarily the result of increased deposits, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing, as well as overnight advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which were used to fund balance sheet growth and to prepay repurchase agreements.\nThe Company recognized net income of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $50.2 million in 2014. Materially impacting 2014 net income was the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nTotal assets increased $154.4 million, or 8.4%, from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2014 to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The net change in assets consisted primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, net loans of $168.1 million, loans held for sale of $15.1 million and cash surrender value of life insurance of $8.0 million offset by decreases in securities of $31.4 million, real estate owned and other repossessed assets of $740,000 and other assets of $7.3 million. Total liabilities increased $150.3 million, or 9.4%, as a result of increases of $48.4 million in interest bearing deposits, $39.5 million in non-interest bearing deposits, and $92.8 million in FHLB advances, which were offset by a $30.0 million decrease in repurchase agreements.\nFunds not currently utilized for general corporate purposes are invested in overnight funds and securities. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.9 million, or 8.9%, to $35.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2015 as a result of increased balances on hand with correspondent banks.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, Home Savings transferred securities with a total amortized cost of $105.3 million with a corresponding fair value of $103.8 million from available for sale to held to maturity. These securities were moved to held to maturity in part to reduce volatility in tangible book value. The net unrealized loss, net of taxes, on these securities at the date of transfer was $999,000. The fair value at the date of transfer became the securities' new cost basis. The unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield. The amortization of the unamortized holding loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will directly offset the effect on interest income from the accretion of the reduced amortized cost for the transferred securities. In addition to the securities transferred to held to maturity in 2015, Home Savings purchased $10.4 million in municipal securities and classified them as held to maturity.\nAlso affecting available for sale securities, were maturities, paydowns and amortization totaling $31.1 million and sales of $16.6 million, along with a positive market value adjustment of $1.3 million during 2015. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 was $4.0 million, pretax, compared to $6.6 million, pretax at December 31, 2014. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt or mortgage-backed securities and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 6.1 years at December 31, 2015. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the portfolio to decline in the normal course. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities to continue to reduce the portfolio, change the duration characteristics of the portfolio, and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nLoans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $9.1 million and loans held for sale, carried at fair value were $26.7 million at December 31, 2015. The Company elected the fair value option for all permanent construction loans held for sale originated on or after January 1, 2015. The increase in loans held for sale during 2015 was the result of loan originations exceeding sales during the period.\nNet loans increased 14.6% to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased $116.8 million, residential mortgage loans increased $43.4 million and consumer loans increased $7.5 million. The primary reason for the increase is the continued focus on growing the commercial loan portfolio. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $17.7 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.33% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.52% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 105.76% at December 31, 2015, compared to 86.48% at December 31, 2014. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade applied to specific risk pools, plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.1 million. This provision expense was the result of overall growth in the loan portfolio offset by the level of net charge-offs and disposition of nonperforming loans.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $39.7 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $45.9 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to the debtor that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. Total TDR loans aggregated $26.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $31.2 million in the prior year.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $2.8 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $23.4 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $16.7 million, or 1.27% of net loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to $20.5 million, or 1.78% of net loans, at December 31, 2014.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days\npast due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $18.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the FHLB paid a cash dividend of $723,000 in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $740,000 or 21.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. During 2015, Home Savings purchased an additional $7.0 million in BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million (including a death benefit of $248,000) and $1.4 million, as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $7.3 million, largely due to change in net deferred tax assets (DTA) during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the net DTA was $20.4 million, and as of December 31, 2014, the net DTA was $28.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. Included in the reversal was $4.1 million due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA, both positive and negative, that could be objectively verified.\nAfter weighing both the positive and negative evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance on the net DTA was no longer warranted as of June 30, 2014. For a more detailed discussion of the Company's tax calculation, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $87.9 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.5 million, or 21.0%, since year-end. During the same time period, interest bearing deposits increased 4.2%, or $48.4 million, which can be attributed to Home Savings' planned expansion efforts in attracting public funds. As of December 31, 2015, Home Savings had $91.3 million in public funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Home Savings had no brokered deposits.\nFunds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $206.3 million as of December 31, 2015. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding term advances of $47.0 million with an effective rate of 2.19% and overnight advances of $232.0 million with a rate of 0.35 % at December 31, 2015.\nOn November 18, 2014, Home Savings modified the $50.0 million fixed-rate term advance with the FHLB. The modification was completed in order to reduce the Company's funding cost. A $3.9 million prepayment penalty was paid by Home Savings as part of the modification, which was deferred and will be amortized on a level yield method over the five-year remaining term of the modified borrowing. The effective rate on the modified borrowing is currently 2.19%, including the impact of the prepayment penalty amortization.\nRepurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased from $30.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $535,000 at December 31, 2015. At the end of December 2015, Home Savings prepaid a $30.0 million tranche of the Company's repurchase agreements and, as a result, incurred a $1.3 million prepayment charge. Similar to the FHLB term advance modification discussed above, these debt prepayment actions were completed in order to reduce the Company's funding costs.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured primarily by mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $0 at December 31, 2015 and approximately $54.7 million at December 31, 2014. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by a brokerage firm in a wholesale transaction and by an independent third party when they are for retail customers. At maturity, the securities underlying the agreements were returned to United Community.\nOther Liabilities. Home Savings receives requests for reimbursements from both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to make them whole on loans sold to them in the secondary market. These loans were originated by Home Savings in the normal course, but such loans have certain defined weaknesses such that a settlement to the investor is required. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery on such expenses of $554,000 associated with these repurchases as a reduction to the reserve. Home Savings has no reserve for future make-whole settlements aggregating at December 31, 2015. Management believes this is adequate given the historical losses incurred to date and the probability that future losses may occur.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $4.1 million to $244.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $240.1 million at December 31, 2014. The change occurred as a result of net income for the period, along with positive adjustments to other comprehensive income for the recovery of value of available for sale securities during the period, offset by the payment of a quarterly dividend as well as the purchase of treasury stock.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income improved $778,000 from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury and government sponsored entities and mortgage-backed securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the rise in longer-term interest rates in 2014 and 2015. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2015 was $5.14 as compared to $4.88 per common share as of December 31, 2014. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as mentioned above.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, of $16.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2015 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million in 2014. Pretax income was significantly higher in 2015. Net interest income for 2015 increased $5.2 million. The provision for loan losses increased $3.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $6.0 million. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85 and 6.65%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $56.6 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income increased $2.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.1 million in the average balance of net loans, despite a decrease in yield on net loans of 25 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $2.1 million in interest paid on repurchase agreements and $688,000 on FHLB advances. These decreases were caused by a reduction of 180 basis points in the cost of FHLB advances due to the 2014 modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements in 2014 caused that expense to decline, year over year. The prepayment of a repurchase agreement in late 2015 did not have a material impact on 2015 results, but is expected to improve margin beginning with the first quarter of 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $2.1 million in 2015, compared to a negative provision of $1.3 million in 2014. The increase in provision for loan losses was caused by an overall increase in outstanding loans during 2015. Also affecting the comparison, during this time period, a large commercial real estate loan paid off in the second quarter of 2014, releasing approximately $748,000 in reserves at that time. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net chargeoffs to average outstanding loans was 17 basis points. This compares to 20 basis points for the same period last year.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased in 2015 to $19.7 million, as compared to $13.7 million in 2014. The increase in noninterest income was driven by increased mortgage banking income, which was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold in the secondary market in the current year, as compared to the prior year. Additionally, Home Savings was able to benefit from the increased pricing from loans originated in the previous year. Home Savings adopted fair-value accounting for newly originated construction perm loans in 2015 and has elected the fair value option for newly originated permanent construction loans held for sale. Fair value accounting more appropriately aligns the recognition of gains with hedging costs incurred during the construction period. See Note 18 discussing fair value.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $49.9 million in 2015, compared to $56.0 million in 2014, a difference of $6.0 million. During 2015, salaries and employee benefits declined, primarily due to organizational restructuring and modification of certain employee benefit plans. The Home Savings postretirement medical plan was curtailed in 2015, and medical benefits will no longer be provided to plan participants as of December 31, 2016. This resulted in the reduction of the postretirement liability and the acceleration of the net periodic benefit credit aggregating $1.3 million. Also affecting the comparison was the recognition of a $923,000 charge related to cost reduction initiatives incurred during the second quarter of 2014, which did not recur in 2015. Equipment and data processing expense declined as a result of lower core-processing system costs. A prepayment penalty was recognized in 2015 as a result of the early payoff of one $30.0 million repurchase agreement. During the previous year, Home Savings paid in full two repurchase agreements aggregating $60.0 million. Other expenses declined $586,000 to $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to last year. Other expenses decreased primarily because of lower expenses incurred associated with a repurchase reserve associated with loans that have been sold in the secondary market. In 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $554,000, based on historical losses and the quantity of loans with potential weakness that would require repurchase. In 2014, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $374,000 for repurchased loans.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax income of $24.2 million, compared to a tax benefit of $39.7 million on pre-tax income of $10.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the variance was the reversal of substantially all of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the quarter ended June 30, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. $4.1 million of the reversal is due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA both positive and negative that could be objectively verified.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future\ntaxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 32.6%. The reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an effective tax rate of zero, excluding the discrete benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $10.0 million, before amortization of the discount on preferred stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. As part of the capital raise in 2013, United Community issued preferred stock that was later converted to common stock. No dividend was declared or paid on the preferred stock. However, because the preferred stock was issued at a price below the then market price of our common stock, the difference is deemed a non-cash dividend under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and is deducted in the calculation of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, net income available to common shareholders as of December 31, 2013 was $3.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.\nThe significant increase in earnings for 2014 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million. In addition, the Company recorded a negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million, compared to provision for loan losses of $4.1 million for 2013.\nNet interest income for 2014 increased $88,000. The provision for loan losses decreased $5.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $777,000. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the comparable period in 2013 were 0.56% and 5.32%, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $51.4 million and $51.3 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income decreased $1.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease of $52.6 million in the average balance of available for sale securities. United Community also experienced a decrease in the yield on net loans of 31 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $1.2 million in interest paid on deposits. The overall decrease in deposit interest expense was attributable to a shift in deposit balances from certificates of deposit to relatively less expensive non-time deposits. Between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, the average outstanding balance of certificates of deposit declined by $68.0 million, while savings deposits increased by $4.9 million. Also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was a reduction of 142 basis points in the cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances due to the modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements caused that expense to decline $316,000, year over year.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million in 2014, compared to a $4.1 million expense in 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, a nonresidential commercial real estate loan aggregating $7.7 million paid off, causing a reduction in the loan loss provision of $748,000. Furthermore, the provision was reduced by $968,000 due to the realignment of loan loss factors assigned to residential mortgage construction loans to parallel the factors of residential mortgage loans. In addition, a $382,000 specific reserve was established in 2013 on another commercial relationship to adjust the net book value to the anticipated resolution balance. This was not a recurring expense in 2014.\nDuring 2014, chargeoffs exceeded provision expense primarily as a result of reserves for loans charged off being established in a prior period. Home Savings also made a change in loan loss factors associated with residential mortgage construction loans. When construction is complete, the loan will convert to a residential mortgage loan. Accordingly, the loan loss factors applied to these construction loans are being aligned with residential mortgage loans. As the level of problem assets has decreased over time, the level of reserves required has declined as well. The historical loss rates have improved and the Company has experienced a lower rate of charge-offs in all loan categories.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased in 2014 to $13.7 million, as compared to $19.7 million in 2013. Lower gains on the sale of securities accounted for some of the change. During 2014, $444,000 in gains on the sale of available for sale securities were recognized as compared to $2.6 million during 2013. Additionally, Home Savings recognized lower mortgage banking income due to a $68.1 million reduction in mortgage originations sold, which resulted in a $3.2 million decline in mortgage banking income. Also affecting the comparison, other income declined and was the result of lower net rental income received on real estate owned and lower debit card fees earned in the current period, compared to the same period last year. In addition, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $628,000 on interest rate caps in 2013. A similar recovery did not reoccur in 2014. The reduction in noninterest income was partially offset by Home Savings incurring fewer losses on the valuation and disposition of real estate owned and other repossessed assets in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $56.0 million in 2014, compared to $56.7 million in 2013, a difference of $777,000. In 2014, noninterest expenses decreased primarily because of lower other expenses incurred of $1.7 million, reduced FDIC premiums of $1.1 million and lowered franchise/financial institutions tax expenses of $772,000. Also contributing to the decline were fewer costs associated with real estate owned and other repossessed assets of $819,000.\nOther non-interest expenses decreased because of lower expenses associated with Home Savings' repurchases of loans sold to investors in the secondary market. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, Home Savings recognized a recovery on such expenses of $374,000 associated with these repurchases. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, Home Savings recognized expenses of $2.0 million.\nReduced FDIC premiums are the result of the termination of all regulatory orders under which the Bank had been operating. The lower franchise/financial institutions tax is the result of a change in Ohio tax law.\nAfter Home Savings takes possession of property in satisfaction of nonperforming loans, all of the repairs, routine maintenance, utilities and real estate taxes associated with such loans are expensed as incurred in order to maintain the properties in saleable condition. Expenses to maintain other real estate owned have continued to decline through 2014 because of the decrease in the number of properties owned by Home Savings. These expenses totaled $631,000 in 2014, as compared to $1.5 million in 2013.\nThe decline in noninterest expense was offset partially by a $3.4 million prepayment charge incurred on the early termination of repurchase agreements mentioned above.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $39.7 million on pre-tax income of $10.5 million, compared to tax expense of $200,000 on pre-tax income of $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The primary reason for the variance was the reversal of substantially all of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the quarter ended June 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the net DTA was $28.1 million, and as of December 31, 2013, the net DTA (prior to any valuation allowance) was $42.8 million. Management maintained a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013 based on consideration of, but not limited to, its cumulative pre-tax losses during the past three years, the composition of recurring and non-recurring income from operations over the past several years and the magnitude of recent taxable income as compared to net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. $4.1 million of the reversal is due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA both positive and negative that could be objectively verified.\nPositive evidence considered included (1) the Company's recent history of quarterly pre-tax earnings (ten out of the last eleven quarters with the most recent quarterly loss being recorded for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 due to a bulk sale of troubled assets), (2) expectations for sustained and continued profitability with sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the remaining net deferred tax benefits, (3) significant reductions in the level of non-performing assets since their peak, which was the primary source of the losses generated in prior periods, (4) resolution of an executive search focused on a key management position, (5) evaluation of core earnings, (6) adequacy of capital to fund balance sheet and future growth, and (7) successful cost-saving initiatives realized during the period.\nNegative evidence considered was (1) the uncertainty about the potential impact on future earnings from nonperforming assets along with (2) a pre-tax loss reported by the Company during one quarterly period over the previous eleven quarters. As the number of consecutive periods of profitability increased and the level of profits are indicative of on-going results, the weight of cumulative losses as negative evidence decreased. A reduction in the weight given to such losses is further validated given that the source of the losses was due to an elevated level of problem assets and related credit costs, which have since been significantly reduced due to the bulk asset sale in 2012 and as evidenced by the improvements in the Company's asset quality metrics.\nAfter weighing both the positive and negative evidence, management determined that a valuation allowance on the net DTA was no longer warranted as of June 30, 2014. For a more detailed discussion of the Company's tax calculation, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nThe reversal of the valuation allowance results in an effective tax rate of zero, excluding the discrete benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 more closely reflects marginal tax rates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of United Community comply with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by United Community are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for loan losses, income taxes, mortgage servicing rights and other-than-temporary impairment are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in United Community's financial position or results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, loan concentrations, specific problem loans, collateral values securing loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower's ability to pay. Determination of the allowance inherently is subjective due to the aforementioned reasons. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance.\nHome Savings maintains a well-documented methodology for maintaining an allowance for loan losses that management believes is compliant with all applicable regulatory guidance and GAAP. The documentation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance is based on management's evaluation of homogeneous groups of loans (single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credit except marine loans) to which loss factors have been applied, as well as an evaluation of individual credits (multi-family, nonresidential mortgage loans, marine loans and commercial loans) based on internal risk ratings, collateral and other unique characteristics of each loan.\nManagement believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio, about which management must make assumptions considering future expectations based on various factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates.\nMortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Management evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a quarterly basis by stratifying the loans by original maturity, interest rate and loan type. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each pool, taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon current industry expectations. An impairment allowance is recorded for a pool when, and in an amount which, its fair value is less than its carrying value.\nThe value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Since most of these loans do not contain prepayment penalties, the Company receives no economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly, and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. We assess any uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. When an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. To determine whether impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. Factors considered in this assessment include the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the obligor, and the general market conditions in the geographic area or industry the in vestee operates in.\nIf we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated, into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nObligation for Loans Sold. Management evaluates certain loans sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, both of whom in the normal course purchase loans originated by Home Savings, for the purpose of making them whole on those loans sold in the secondary market. Historically, some loans sold had certain identified weaknesses such that, in the opinion of management, a settlement to the investor is required. In performing its evaluation, management considers all available evidence relevant to the collectability of the loan as well as the value of any underlying collateral. In determining a reserve for future make-whole reserves, management develops a factor based on historical loss experience and a probability that sold loans will require make-whole settlements and applies that against its total servicing portfolio to determine a reserve to absorb future settlements. Management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the reserve. However, future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.\nYields Earned and Rates Paid\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to United Community's average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Loan fees are included in interest income. The average balance for securities available for sale is computed using the carrying value, and the average yield on securities available for sale has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Like most financial institutions, Home Savings' short-term interest income and interest expense are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond its control. Accordingly, Home Savings' earnings could be adversely affected during a continued period of low interest rates or a continued period of rising interest rates.\nThe impact of changes in interest rates is further described in", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings for the year ended December 31, 2015. It covers areas such as overview, changes in financial condition, funds management, loan portfolios, allowance for loan losses, nonperforming loans, other assets and liabilities, and comparison of operating results with 2014 and 2013. The report also includes information on net income, net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and federal income taxes. It highlights the significant impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in 2014 and the change in various financial metrics between 2015 and 2014.", "item_7_tables": "", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nUnited Community was incorporated in the State of Ohio in February 1998 for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Home Savings issued upon the Conversion of Home Savings from a mutual savings association to a permanent capital stock savings association. The Conversion was completed on July 8, 1998.\nFrom August 8, 2008 until July 2, 2013, United Community was subject to an Order to Cease and Desist, as amended, and from July 9, 2013 to January 8, 2014 a Memorandum of Understanding. The Order and Memorandum of Understanding generally restricted United Community's ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or issue debt without the FRB's (as successor to the Office of Thrift Supervision) prior approval.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nTotal assets increased 8.4% to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. Contributing to the change were increases in net loans, loans held for sale and cash surrender value of life insurance. These changes were offset by decreases in securities, real estate owned and other repossessed assets and other assets. Total liabilities increased 9.4% to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015. This change was primarily the result of increased deposits, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing, as well as overnight advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which were used to fund balance sheet growth and to prepay repurchase agreements.\nThe Company recognized net income of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $50.2 million in 2014. Materially impacting 2014 net income was the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nTotal assets increased $154.4 million, or 8.4%, from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2014 to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The net change in assets consisted primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, net loans of $168.1 million, loans held for sale of $15.1 million and cash surrender value of life insurance of $8.0 million offset by decreases in securities of $31.4 million, real estate owned and other repossessed assets of $740,000 and other assets of $7.3 million. Total liabilities increased $150.3 million, or 9.4%, as a result of increases of $48.4 million in interest bearing deposits, $39.5 million in non-interest bearing deposits, and $92.8 million in FHLB advances, which were offset by a $30.0 million decrease in repurchase agreements.\nFunds not currently utilized for general corporate purposes are invested in overnight funds and securities. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.9 million, or 8.9%, to $35.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2015 as a result of increased balances on hand with correspondent banks.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, Home Savings transferred securities with a total amortized cost of $105.3 million with a corresponding fair value of $103.8 million from available for sale to held to maturity. These securities were moved to held to maturity in part to reduce volatility in tangible book value. The net unrealized loss, net of taxes, on these securities at the date of transfer was $999,000. The fair value at the date of transfer became the securities' new cost basis. The unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield. The amortization of the unamortized holding loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will directly offset the effect on interest income from the accretion of the reduced amortized cost for the transferred securities. In addition to the securities transferred to held to maturity in 2015, Home Savings purchased $10.4 million in municipal securities and classified them as held to maturity.\nAlso affecting available for sale securities, were maturities, paydowns and amortization totaling $31.1 million and sales of $16.6 million, along with a positive market value adjustment of $1.3 million during 2015. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 was $4.0 million, pretax, compared to $6.6 million, pretax at December 31, 2014. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt or mortgage-backed securities and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 6.1 years at December 31, 2015. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the portfolio to decline in the normal course. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities to continue to reduce the portfolio, change the duration characteristics of the portfolio, and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nLoans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $9.1 million and loans held for sale, carried at fair value were $26.7 million at December 31, 2015. The Company elected the fair value option for all permanent construction loans held for sale originated on or after January 1, 2015. The increase in loans held for sale during 2015 was the result of loan originations exceeding sales during the period.\nNet loans increased 14.6% to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased $116.8 million, residential mortgage loans increased $43.4 million and consumer loans increased $7.5 million. The primary reason for the increase is the continued focus on growing the commercial loan portfolio. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $17.7 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.33% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.52% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 105.76% at December 31, 2015, compared to 86.48% at December 31, 2014. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade applied to specific risk pools, plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.1 million. This provision expense was the result of overall growth in the loan portfolio offset by the level of net charge-offs and disposition of nonperforming loans.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $39.7 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $45.9 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to the debtor that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. Total TDR loans aggregated $26.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $31.2 million in the prior year.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $2.8 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $23.4 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $16.7 million, or 1.27% of net loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to $20.5 million, or 1.78% of net loans, at December 31, 2014.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days\npast due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $18.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the FHLB paid a cash dividend of $723,000 in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $740,000 or 21.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. During 2015, Home Savings purchased an additional $7.0 million in BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million (including a death benefit of $248,000) and $1.4 million, as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $7.3 million, largely due to change in net deferred tax assets (DTA) during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the net DTA was $20.4 million, and as of December 31, 2014, the net DTA was $28.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. Included in the reversal was $4.1 million due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA, both positive and negative, that could be objectively verified.\nAfter weighing both the positive and negative evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance on the net DTA was no longer warranted as of June 30, 2014. For a more detailed discussion of the Company's tax calculation, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $87.9 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.5 million, or 21.0%, since year-end. During the same time period, interest bearing deposits increased 4.2%, or $48.4 million, which can be attributed to Home Savings' planned expansion efforts in attracting public funds. As of December 31, 2015, Home Savings had $91.3 million in public funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Home Savings had no brokered deposits.\nFunds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $206.3 million as of December 31, 2015. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding term advances of $47.0 million with an effective rate of 2.19% and overnight advances of $232.0 million with a rate of 0.35 % at December 31, 2015.\nOn November 18, 2014, Home Savings modified the $50.0 million fixed-rate term advance with the FHLB. The modification was completed in order to reduce the Company's funding cost. A $3.9 million prepayment penalty was paid by Home Savings as part of the modification, which was deferred and will be amortized on a level yield method over the five-year remaining term of the modified borrowing. The effective rate on the modified borrowing is currently 2.19%, including the impact of the prepayment penalty amortization.\nRepurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased from $30.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $535,000 at December 31, 2015. At the end of December 2015, Home Savings prepaid a $30.0 million tranche of the Company's repurchase agreements and, as a result, incurred a $1.3 million prepayment charge. Similar to the FHLB term advance modification discussed above, these debt prepayment actions were completed in order to reduce the Company's funding costs.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured primarily by mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $0 at December 31, 2015 and approximately $54.7 million at December 31, 2014. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by a brokerage firm in a wholesale transaction and by an independent third party when they are for retail customers. At maturity, the securities underlying the agreements were returned to United Community.\nOther Liabilities. Home Savings receives requests for reimbursements from both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to make them whole on loans sold to them in the secondary market. These loans were originated by Home Savings in the normal course, but such loans have certain defined weaknesses such that a settlement to the investor is required. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery on such expenses of $554,000 associated with these repurchases as a reduction to the reserve. Home Savings has no reserve for future make-whole settlements aggregating at December 31, 2015. Management believes this is adequate given the historical losses incurred to date and the probability that future losses may occur.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $4.1 million to $244.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $240.1 million at December 31, 2014. The change occurred as a result of net income for the period, along with positive adjustments to other comprehensive income for the recovery of value of available for sale securities during the period, offset by the payment of a quarterly dividend as well as the purchase of treasury stock.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income improved $778,000 from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury and government sponsored entities and mortgage-backed securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the rise in longer-term interest rates in 2014 and 2015. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2015 was $5.14 as compared to $4.88 per common share as of December 31, 2014. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as mentioned above.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, of $16.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2015 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million in 2014. Pretax income was significantly higher in 2015. Net interest income for 2015 increased $5.2 million. The provision for loan losses increased $3.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $6.0 million. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85 and 6.65%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $56.6 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income increased $2.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.1 million in the average balance of net loans, despite a decrease in yield on net loans of 25 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $2.1 million in interest paid on repurchase agreements and $688,000 on FHLB advances. These decreases were caused by a reduction of 180 basis points in the cost of FHLB advances due to the 2014 modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements in 2014 caused that expense to decline, year over year. The prepayment of a repurchase agreement in late 2015 did not have a material impact on 2015 results, but is expected to improve margin beginning with the first quarter of 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $2.1 million in 2015, compared to a negative provision of $1.3 million in 2014. The increase in provision for loan losses was caused by an overall increase in outstanding loans during 2015. Also affecting the comparison, during this time period, a large commercial real estate loan paid off in the second quarter of 2014, releasing approximately $748,000 in reserves at that time. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net chargeoffs to average outstanding loans was 17 basis points. This compares to 20 basis points for the same period last year.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased in 2015 to $19.7 million, as compared to $13.7 million in 2014. The increase in noninterest income was driven by increased mortgage banking income, which was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold in the secondary market in the current year, as compared to the prior year. Additionally, Home Savings was able to benefit from the increased pricing from loans originated in the previous year. Home Savings adopted fair-value accounting for newly originated construction perm loans in 2015 and has elected the fair value option for newly originated permanent construction loans held for sale. Fair value accounting more appropriately aligns the recognition of gains with hedging costs incurred during the construction period. See Note 18 discussing fair value.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $49.9 million in 2015, compared to $56.0 million in 2014, a difference of $6.0 million. During 2015, salaries and employee benefits declined, primarily due to organizational restructuring and modification of certain employee benefit plans. The Home Savings postretirement medical plan was curtailed in 2015, and medical benefits will no longer be provided to plan participants as of December 31, 2016. This resulted in the reduction of the postretirement liability and the acceleration of the net periodic benefit credit aggregating $1.3 million. Also affecting the comparison was the recognition of a $923,000 charge related to cost reduction initiatives incurred during the second quarter of 2014, which did not recur in 2015. Equipment and data processing expense declined as a result of lower core-processing system costs. A prepayment penalty was recognized in 2015 as a result of the early payoff of one $30.0 million repurchase agreement. During the previous year, Home Savings paid in full two repurchase agreements aggregating $60.0 million. Other expenses declined $586,000 to $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to last year. Other expenses decreased primarily because of lower expenses incurred associated with a repurchase reserve associated with loans that have been sold in the secondary market. In 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $554,000, based on historical losses and the quantity of loans with potential weakness that would require repurchase. In 2014, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $374,000 for repurchased loans.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax income of $24.2 million, compared to a tax benefit of $39.7 million on pre-tax income of $10.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the variance was the reversal of substantially all of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the quarter ended June 30, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. $4.1 million of the reversal is due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA both positive and negative that could be objectively verified.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future\ntaxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 32.6%. The reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an effective tax rate of zero, excluding the discrete benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $10.0 million, before amortization of the discount on preferred stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. As part of the capital raise in 2013, United Community issued preferred stock that was later converted to common stock. No dividend was declared or paid on the preferred stock. However, because the preferred stock was issued at a price below the then market price of our common stock, the difference is deemed a non-cash dividend under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and is deducted in the calculation of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, net income available to common shareholders as of December 31, 2013 was $3.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.\nThe significant increase in earnings for 2014 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million. In addition, the Company recorded a negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million, compared to provision for loan losses of $4.1 million for 2013.\nNet interest income for 2014 increased $88,000. The provision for loan losses decreased $5.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $777,000. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the comparable period in 2013 were 0.56% and 5.32%, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $51.4 million and $51.3 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income decreased $1.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease of $52.6 million in the average balance of available for sale securities. United Community also experienced a decrease in the yield on net loans of 31 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $1.2 million in interest paid on deposits. The overall decrease in deposit interest expense was attributable to a shift in deposit balances from certificates of deposit to relatively less expensive non-time deposits. Between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, the average outstanding balance of certificates of deposit declined by $68.0 million, while savings deposits increased by $4.9 million. Also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was a reduction of 142 basis points in the cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances due to the modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements caused that expense to decline $316,000, year over year.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million in 2014, compared to a $4.1 million expense in 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, a nonresidential commercial real estate loan aggregating $7.7 million paid off, causing a reduction in the loan loss provision of $748,000. Furthermore, the provision was reduced by $968,000 due to the realignment of loan", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nUnited Community was incorporated in the State of Ohio in February 1998 for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Home Savings issued upon the Conversion of Home Savings from a mutual savings association to a permanent capital stock savings association. The Conversion was completed on July 8, 1998.\nFrom August 8, 2008 until July 2, 2013, United Community was subject to an Order to Cease and Desist, as amended, and from July 9, 2013 to January 8, 2014 a Memorandum of Understanding. The Order and Memorandum of Understanding generally restricted United Community's ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or issue debt without the FRB's (as successor to the Office of Thrift Supervision) prior approval.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nTotal assets increased 8.4% to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. Contributing to the change were increases in net loans, loans held for sale and cash surrender value of life insurance. These changes were offset by decreases in securities, real estate owned and other repossessed assets and other assets. Total liabilities increased 9.4% to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015. This change was primarily the result of increased deposits, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing, as well as overnight advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which were used to fund balance sheet growth and to prepay repurchase agreements.\nThe Company recognized net income of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net income of $50.2 million in 2014. Materially impacting 2014 net income was the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nTotal assets increased $154.4 million, or 8.4%, from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2014 to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The net change in assets consisted primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, net loans of $168.1 million, loans held for sale of $15.1 million and cash surrender value of life insurance of $8.0 million offset by decreases in securities of $31.4 million, real estate owned and other repossessed assets of $740,000 and other assets of $7.3 million. Total liabilities increased $150.3 million, or 9.4%, as a result of increases of $48.4 million in interest bearing deposits, $39.5 million in non-interest bearing deposits, and $92.8 million in FHLB advances, which were offset by a $30.0 million decrease in repurchase agreements.\nFunds not currently utilized for general corporate purposes are invested in overnight funds and securities. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.9 million, or 8.9%, to $35.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2015 as a result of increased balances on hand with correspondent banks.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, Home Savings transferred securities with a total amortized cost of $105.3 million with a corresponding fair value of $103.8 million from available for sale to held to maturity. These securities were moved to held to maturity in part to reduce volatility in tangible book value. The net unrealized loss, net of taxes, on these securities at the date of transfer was $999,000. The fair value at the date of transfer became the securities' new cost basis. The unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield. The amortization of the unamortized holding loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will directly offset the effect on interest income from the accretion of the reduced amortized cost for the transferred securities. In addition to the securities transferred to held to maturity in 2015, Home Savings purchased $10.4 million in municipal securities and classified them as held to maturity.\nAlso affecting available for sale securities, were maturities, paydowns and amortization totaling $31.1 million and sales of $16.6 million, along with a positive market value adjustment of $1.3 million during 2015. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 was $4.0 million, pretax, compared to $6.6 million, pretax at December 31, 2014. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt or mortgage-backed securities and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 6.1 years at December 31, 2015. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the portfolio to decline in the normal course. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities to continue to reduce the portfolio, change the duration characteristics of the portfolio, and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nLoans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $9.1 million and loans held for sale, carried at fair value were $26.7 million at December 31, 2015. The Company elected the fair value option for all permanent construction loans held for sale originated on or after January 1, 2015. The increase in loans held for sale during 2015 was the result of loan originations exceeding sales during the period.\nNet loans increased 14.6% to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Commercial loans increased $116.8 million, residential mortgage loans increased $43.4 million and consumer loans increased $7.5 million. The primary reason for the increase is the continued focus on growing the commercial loan portfolio. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $17.7 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.33% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.52% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 105.76% at December 31, 2015, compared to 86.48% at December 31, 2014. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade applied to specific risk pools, plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.1 million. This provision expense was the result of overall growth in the loan portfolio offset by the level of net charge-offs and disposition of nonperforming loans.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $39.7 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $45.9 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to the debtor that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. Total TDR loans aggregated $26.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $31.2 million in the prior year.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $2.8 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $23.4 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $16.7 million, or 1.27% of net loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to $20.5 million, or 1.78% of net loans, at December 31, 2014.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days\npast due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $18.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the FHLB paid a cash dividend of $723,000 in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $740,000 or 21.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. During 2015, Home Savings purchased an additional $7.0 million in BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million (including a death benefit of $248,000) and $1.4 million, as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $7.3 million, largely due to change in net deferred tax assets (DTA) during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the net DTA was $20.4 million, and as of December 31, 2014, the net DTA was $28.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. Included in the reversal was $4.1 million due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA, both positive and negative, that could be objectively verified.\nAfter weighing both the positive and negative evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance on the net DTA was no longer warranted as of June 30, 2014. For a more detailed discussion of the Company's tax calculation, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $87.9 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.5 million, or 21.0%, since year-end. During the same time period, interest bearing deposits increased 4.2%, or $48.4 million, which can be attributed to Home Savings' planned expansion efforts in attracting public funds. As of December 31, 2015, Home Savings had $91.3 million in public funds. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Home Savings had no brokered deposits.\nFunds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $206.3 million as of December 31, 2015. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding term advances of $47.0 million with an effective rate of 2.19% and overnight advances of $232.0 million with a rate of 0.35 % at December 31, 2015.\nOn November 18, 2014, Home Savings modified the $50.0 million fixed-rate term advance with the FHLB. The modification was completed in order to reduce the Company's funding cost. A $3.9 million prepayment penalty was paid by Home Savings as part of the modification, which was deferred and will be amortized on a level yield method over the five-year remaining term of the modified borrowing. The effective rate on the modified borrowing is currently 2.19%, including the impact of the prepayment penalty amortization.\nRepurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings. Repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased from $30.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $535,000 at December 31, 2015. At the end of December 2015, Home Savings prepaid a $30.0 million tranche of the Company's repurchase agreements and, as a result, incurred a $1.3 million prepayment charge. Similar to the FHLB term advance modification discussed above, these debt prepayment actions were completed in order to reduce the Company's funding costs.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured primarily by mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $0 at December 31, 2015 and approximately $54.7 million at December 31, 2014. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by a brokerage firm in a wholesale transaction and by an independent third party when they are for retail customers. At maturity, the securities underlying the agreements were returned to United Community.\nOther Liabilities. Home Savings receives requests for reimbursements from both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to make them whole on loans sold to them in the secondary market. These loans were originated by Home Savings in the normal course, but such loans have certain defined weaknesses such that a settlement to the investor is required. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery on such expenses of $554,000 associated with these repurchases as a reduction to the reserve. Home Savings has no reserve for future make-whole settlements aggregating at December 31, 2015. Management believes this is adequate given the historical losses incurred to date and the probability that future losses may occur.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $4.1 million to $244.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $240.1 million at December 31, 2014. The change occurred as a result of net income for the period, along with positive adjustments to other comprehensive income for the recovery of value of available for sale securities during the period, offset by the payment of a quarterly dividend as well as the purchase of treasury stock.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income improved $778,000 from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury and government sponsored entities and mortgage-backed securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the rise in longer-term interest rates in 2014 and 2015. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2015 was $5.14 as compared to $4.88 per common share as of December 31, 2014. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as mentioned above.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, of $16.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2015 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million in 2014. Pretax income was significantly higher in 2015. Net interest income for 2015 increased $5.2 million. The provision for loan losses increased $3.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $6.0 million. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85 and 6.65%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $56.6 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income increased $2.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.1 million in the average balance of net loans, despite a decrease in yield on net loans of 25 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $2.1 million in interest paid on repurchase agreements and $688,000 on FHLB advances. These decreases were caused by a reduction of 180 basis points in the cost of FHLB advances due to the 2014 modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements in 2014 caused that expense to decline, year over year. The prepayment of a repurchase agreement in late 2015 did not have a material impact on 2015 results, but is expected to improve margin beginning with the first quarter of 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $2.1 million in 2015, compared to a negative provision of $1.3 million in 2014. The increase in provision for loan losses was caused by an overall increase in outstanding loans during 2015. Also affecting the comparison, during this time period, a large commercial real estate loan paid off in the second quarter of 2014, releasing approximately $748,000 in reserves at that time. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net chargeoffs to average outstanding loans was 17 basis points. This compares to 20 basis points for the same period last year.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased in 2015 to $19.7 million, as compared to $13.7 million in 2014. The increase in noninterest income was driven by increased mortgage banking income, which was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold in the secondary market in the current year, as compared to the prior year. Additionally, Home Savings was able to benefit from the increased pricing from loans originated in the previous year. Home Savings adopted fair-value accounting for newly originated construction perm loans in 2015 and has elected the fair value option for newly originated permanent construction loans held for sale. Fair value accounting more appropriately aligns the recognition of gains with hedging costs incurred during the construction period. See Note 18 discussing fair value.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $49.9 million in 2015, compared to $56.0 million in 2014, a difference of $6.0 million. During 2015, salaries and employee benefits declined, primarily due to organizational restructuring and modification of certain employee benefit plans. The Home Savings postretirement medical plan was curtailed in 2015, and medical benefits will no longer be provided to plan participants as of December 31, 2016. This resulted in the reduction of the postretirement liability and the acceleration of the net periodic benefit credit aggregating $1.3 million. Also affecting the comparison was the recognition of a $923,000 charge related to cost reduction initiatives incurred during the second quarter of 2014, which did not recur in 2015. Equipment and data processing expense declined as a result of lower core-processing system costs. A prepayment penalty was recognized in 2015 as a result of the early payoff of one $30.0 million repurchase agreement. During the previous year, Home Savings paid in full two repurchase agreements aggregating $60.0 million. Other expenses declined $586,000 to $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to last year. Other expenses decreased primarily because of lower expenses incurred associated with a repurchase reserve associated with loans that have been sold in the secondary market. In 2015, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $554,000, based on historical losses and the quantity of loans with potential weakness that would require repurchase. In 2014, Home Savings recognized a recovery of $374,000 for repurchased loans.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax income of $24.2 million, compared to a tax benefit of $39.7 million on pre-tax income of $10.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the variance was the reversal of substantially all of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the quarter ended June 30, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had reversed $42.8 million of the valuation allowance on its net DTA. $4.1 million of the reversal is due to current year-to-date operating income; the remaining $38.7 million is due to management's reassessment and judgment regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years. The realization of a DTA is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the DTA will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as the DTA being more than 50% likely of being realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance against the net DTA is required. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence about the realization of the DTA both positive and negative that could be objectively verified.\nThe Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future\ntaxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 32.6%. The reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an effective tax rate of zero, excluding the discrete benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, of $50.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $10.0 million, before amortization of the discount on preferred stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. As part of the capital raise in 2013, United Community issued preferred stock that was later converted to common stock. No dividend was declared or paid on the preferred stock. However, because the preferred stock was issued at a price below the then market price of our common stock, the difference is deemed a non-cash dividend under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and is deducted in the calculation of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, net income available to common shareholders as of December 31, 2013 was $3.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.\nThe significant increase in earnings for 2014 was primarily a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, which provided an income tax benefit of $39.7 million. In addition, the Company recorded a negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million, compared to provision for loan losses of $4.1 million for 2013.\nNet interest income for 2014 increased $88,000. The provision for loan losses decreased $5.4 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $6.0 million and noninterest expense decreased $777,000. United Community's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.82% and 23.30%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the comparable period in 2013 were 0.56% and 5.32%, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $51.4 million and $51.3 million, respectively.\nTotal interest income decreased $1.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease of $52.6 million in the average balance of available for sale securities. United Community also experienced a decrease in the yield on net loans of 31 basis points.\nTotal interest expense decreased $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period last year. The change was due primarily to reductions of $1.2 million in interest paid on deposits. The overall decrease in deposit interest expense was attributable to a shift in deposit balances from certificates of deposit to relatively less expensive non-time deposits. Between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, the average outstanding balance of certificates of deposit declined by $68.0 million, while savings deposits increased by $4.9 million. Also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was a reduction of 142 basis points in the cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances due to the modification discussed above. Additionally the impact of the prepayment of repurchase agreements caused that expense to decline $316,000, year over year.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized negative loan loss provision of $1.3 million in 2014, compared to a $4.1 million expense in 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, a nonresidential commercial real estate loan aggregating $7.7 million paid off, causing a reduction in the loan loss provision of $748,000. Furthermore, the provision was reduced by $968,000 due to the realignment of loan"}
