Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSignificant Developments\nOn January 1, 2020, Joel T. Murphy became Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Murphy will continue as a member of the board, where he has served since May 2019. Mr. Murphy was the CEO of our New Market Properties subsidiary for the last five years until his appointment as our CEO. Mr. Murphy succeeded our previous CEO and Chairman of the Board, Daniel M. DuPree, who has remained with us as Executive Chairman of the Board.\nOn January 31, 2020, we internalized the functions performed by Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Manager\") and NMP Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Sub-Manager\") by acquiring the entities that owned the Former Manager and the Former Sub-Manager (such transactions, collectively, the \"Internalization\") for an aggregate purchase price of $154.0 million, plus up to $25.0 million of additional consideration. Additionally, up to $15.0 million of the $154.0 million purchase price was to be held back and is payable to the sellers less certain losses following final resolution of certain specified matters. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 31, 2020 the sellers sold all of the outstanding shares of NELL Partners, Inc. ( NELL\u201d) and NMA Holdings, Inc. (\"NMA\"), parent companies of the Former Manager and Former Sub-Manager, respectively, to us, in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $111.1 million in cash paid at the closing which reflects the satisfaction of certain indebtedness of NELL, the estimated net working capital adjustment, and a hold back of $15.0 million for certain specified matters. Trusts established, or entities owned, by the family of John A. Williams, the Company's former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel M. DuPree, the Company's Executive Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Leonard A. Silverstein, the Company's former Vice Chairman of the Board, and former President and Chief Operating Officer, were the owners of NELL. Trusts established, or entities owned, by Joel T. Murphy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, the family of Mr. Williams, Mr. DuPree and Mr. Silverstein were the owners of the Former Sub-Manager.\nAt our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, William J. Gresham, Jr., Leonard A. Silverstein, and John M. Wiens did not stand for re-election as members of our Board of Directors and John M. Cannon was elected as a member of our Board of Directors until our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, if and when a successor is elected and qualified.\nOn November 3, 2020 we sold all eight of our student housing communities and one real estate loan investment to an unrelated third party. This transaction represented our exit from the student housing sector.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired four multifamily communities and two grocery-anchored shopping centers. We also sold one multifamily community and contributed one grocery-anchored shopping center to a joint venture in exchange for cash and a 50% interest in the joint venture.\nOn November 19, 2020, we announced an approval by our common stockholders of a reduction of our call option on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock from 10 years to 5 years.\nOn November 24, 2020, we called and redeemed 208,786 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which was approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock that was available to be redeemed at our option. Holders of another approximate 149,938 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock were redeemed by the holders during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 144,645 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $130.2 million and we issued 18,845 shares of Series M1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $18.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 65,298 Units (one share of Series A Preferred Stock and one warrant to purchase 20 shares of our Common Stock) and collected net proceeds of approximately $58.8 million from our $1.5 Billion Unit Offering. We issued no mShares during 2020. Our Preferred Stock offerings and our other equity offerings are discussed in detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued approximately 617,000 shares of Common Stock under our ATM Program.\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"expects,\" \"assumes,\" \"goals,\" \"guidance,\" \"trends\" and similar expressions, constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndustry Outlook\nIn spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe continued, albeit sporadic, improvement in the United States' economy will take hold for 2021, with continued improvement in the job market from pandemic lows and growth and improvements in the overall economy. As the country combats the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccine rollouts and other measures, it should be the case that the impact from the pandemic lessens and the economy can begin a path to normalcy. The new presidential administration reduces some uncertainty in the direction and trajectory of economic growth and increases the probability of a larger stimulus package being enacted, which should also energize the economy and speed economic recovery. We believe a recovering economy, improving job market and increased consumer confidence should help create favorable conditions in the recovery for the multifamily sector, grocery-anchored shopping centers and class A office demand.\nMultifamily Communities\nThe Company continues to believe in the health of the multifamily industry, which is driven by both favorable demographic tailwinds and strong economic fundamentals.\nTwo of the nation's largest generational cohorts - an estimated 72 million Millennials and 72 million Baby Boomers - continue to create demand for multifamily housing. Lifestyle trends within these groups support the multifamily thesis, with Millennials seeking flexibility and Baby Boomers looking to downsize and reduce ongoing maintenance required with home ownership. These trends are further amplified within the Company's footprint and strategy: operating newly-constructed Class A communities in growing sunbelt suburban markets. The sunbelt continues to benefit from in-migration trends as weather, affordability and friendly business environments attract households and corporations alike. Millennials, who on average are forming households and starting families later than prior generations, are now searching for additional square footage, relative affordability and good schools; attributes that are generally more prevalent in the suburbs.\nFundamentally, the multifamily industry is benefiting from the current housing shortage in the United States, which Freddie Mac estimates at 2.5 million housing units. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. is in the early stages of an economic expansion, which we believe would drive job growth, and lead to increased multifamily demand. The sector continues to show resiliency and positive momentum as forecasts generally support stable occupancy, rent growth and net absorption of units.\nInvestors, both domestic and abroad, continue to seek quality multifamily housing given strong secular demand and the financial stability of the industry. Commercial real estate investment volume remains high with multifamily realizing more volume than any other property type; a trend that has been ongoing and is expected to continue. Moreover, mortgage production remains very healthy and efficient as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, life insurance companies and collateralized mortgage-backed securities lenders compete for borrowers as they see increased demand for multifamily debt, whether for their own account or securitized.\nStrategically, the Company is focused on the goal of outperforming the multifamily market on a risk adjusted basis, as it looks for investments that offer an attractive location, superior product or provide a value proposition. Moreover, the Company is purposeful in its management of assets, aiming to provide a relatively stable and steady rental stream from its portfolio by employing principally fixed-rate long-term project-level debt financing and adhering to strict leasing guidelines regarding the credit worthiness of its tenants.\nNew Market Properties\nWe specialize in owning and operating shopping centers anchored by market-leading grocers complemented by convenience-based retailers across high growth suburban Sunbelt markets. These centers are primarily anchored by Publix, Kroger, Harris Teeter and other market share leading grocers with high sales per square foot. The merchandising mix of our portfolio is focused on e-commerce resiliency and has proven its stability and strength during the COVID-19 pandemic. The retailers who have been successful have embraced the coexistence of their bricks and mortars with a parallel and complimentary e-commerce business. Retailers are focused on optimizing in store pickup programs, while also using their existing bricks and mortar locations as fulfillment centers for these e-commerce businesses.\nOur neighborhood driven and convenience focused shopping centers proved to be more important to their communities than ever during 2020. Kroger reported sales increases of 10.9% for the period ending November 7, 2020. Ahold Delhaize (Giant/Food Lion) reported fourth quarter 2020 same store sales increases of 11.2% and a 15.6% year-over-year increase on annual 2020 sales and we anticipate Publix increases to be comparable when they report. Retailers have recognized the benefits of being located in shopping centers anchored by heavily trafficked grocers which is evidenced in our pace of leasing towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. The company continued its solid performance in the 4th quarter, collecting approximately 97% of recurring rent charges, unadjusted for deferrals, up from collections of 92% and 96% in second and third quarters, respectively. Approximately 54% of our annual base rent comes from essential tenants who remained open throughout the pandemic and approximately 34% of our annual base rent comes from our grocery and pharmacy partners, who are closing out a very strong year of sales in 2020.\nIndicative of the continuing recovery from the pandemic, the pace of deferral requests has slowed significantly. As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $1.9 million of retail recurring rental revenue, or approximately 2.7% cumulatively during the pandemic's three quarters. Rent deferrals have included lease amendments that add additional term and/or eliminate cumbersome operational restrictions on the center. We believe these amendments will ultimately result in unlocking additional long-term value across the portfolio. We attribute our strong operational performance throughout the pandemic to our essential and convenience-based tenant mix collaborating creatively and efficiently with our asset management, leasing and property\nmanagement teams to find optimal solutions for all parties involved. We are confident in our portfolio's tenant make up, focused on market leading grocers complemented by necessity and convenience-based tenants.\nCOVID-19 accelerated the migration out of the Northeast and California and into the high growth Sunbelt markets that the company has invested in. According to a report by Clarion, population growth in the Sunbelt is expected to accelerate by another 19 million (13%), while non-Sunbelt states are forecasted to rise by only 3 million, or 2%, over the next decade. The amount of job growth and population growth taking place in the Sunbelt is encouraging and is tied to companies and employees seeking better climate and lower cost of living. Further, employers are helping facilitate the growth as they flock to the Sunbelt for the more business friendly environments and lower costs of doing business. Many retailers are taking note of the increasing migration of their consumers to the Sunbelt and are focused on increasing their bricks and mortar presence throughout the region.\nThe retail bankruptcies that have taken place over the last 12-24 months were primarily centered in business concepts predicted by many to be on the verge of failing prior to the pandemic. On a forward-looking basis, the company is monitoring the market and anticipates that there could be additional bankruptcies that occur. We actively track our Watch List\u201d tenants based on market knowledge and tenant conversations. This list is used to help proactively evaluate strategic alternatives for tenants at risk. The company currently has minimal exposure to our Watch List, with under 3% of our New Market Properties segment's annual base rent attributed to such tenants.\nPreferred Office Properties\nPreferred Office Properties operates a 3.2 million square foot portfolio of Class A office assets in markets across the Sunbelt. While new leasing activity has slowed and sublease availability has increased in most markets due to uncertainty from COVID-19, and we expect to see some level of continued soft demand in the near-term; the Company's office investments are 95% leased with only approximately 12% of the portfolio leases expiring through the end of 2022. Furthermore, multi-year contractual leases and rent schedules paired with high quality tenant balance sheets have offered protection against adverse impacts of COVID-19, and office-using employment has fared better to date in the pandemic than have hourly wage earners.\nDespite the ongoing adverse effect of the pandemic, we continue to hold a positive long-term outlook for the office industry in our targeted markets. We are optimistic that the distribution of vaccines creates the opportunity for business to begin to return to more normal activity over the course of 2021. While we think the prevalence of work from home will continue in some capacity, we expect the physical office to remain the center of the business workplace. According to a recent survey conducted by PwC, 87% of executives believe the office is critical for collaborating with team members and building relationships.\nIn addition, the pandemic has accelerated a number of trends that were already serving as tailwinds for our target markets, especially the demographic shifts from larger, more expensive gateway cities like New York and San Francisco to the suburban, Sunbelt markets. According to a 2018 report by Moody's Analytics, for 2008 - 2018 the Sunbelt population grew 3 times faster than non-Sunbelt states. Moody's projects that for 2019 - 2030 that outpacing will accelerate to nearly 7 times non-Sunbelt states. And the latest U.S. Census estimates show that Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia were among the top five states in the nation in terms of nominal population gains in 2020. As a result, we are seeing significant interest from small and large companies looking to relocate and/or expand their office footprint in our Sunbelt markets because of the deep talent pool, low cost of living and doing business, and comparatively low density. As we believe these trends will continue, we remain optimistic about the Sunbelt office markets that are in the path of long-term growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical. We consider these policies critical because they involve the application of significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nReal Estate\nCost Capitalization. Investments in real estate properties are carried at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building and land improvements and 5 to 10 years for computers, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred for transactions that are deemed to be business combinations. Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 (\"ASU 2017-01\"), which was released in January 2017, clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 and believe our future acquisitions of multifamily communities, office buildings, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and student housing communities will generally qualify as asset acquisitions. Pursuant to ASU 2017-01, certain qualifying acquisition costs will be capitalized and amortized rather than expensed as incurred.\nRepairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the items' estimated useful lives. Repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate property. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.\nReal Estate Acquisition Valuation. Following our adoption of ASU 2017-01, we generally record the acquisitions of income-producing real estate as asset acquisitions.\nAll assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values.\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining average non-cancelable term of the leases. We amortize any recorded above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase, respectively, to rental income over the remaining average non-cancelable term of the respective leases. The capitalized above-market leases and in place leases are included in the acquired intangible assets line of the consolidated balance sheets. Both above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases for office properties. The amortization period for retail shopping center leases is the remaining lease term plus any below market probable renewal options.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. These estimates include estimated carrying costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods.\nThe fair values of in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties represent the value of direct costs associated with leasing, including opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring in-place leases. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, legal and marketing costs, incentives such as tenant improvement allowances and other direct costs. Such direct costs are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is estimated using the estimated market lease rates and the estimated absorption period of the space. These direct costs and opportunity costs are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as acquired intangible assets and are amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair values of above-market and below-market in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases, taking into consideration the probability of renewals for any below-market leases. Acquired in-place lease values for multifamily communities and student housing communities are amortized to operating expense over the average remaining non-cancelable term of the respective in-place leases.\nEstimating the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, the number of years the property will be held for investment and market interest\nrates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact their subsequent amortization and ultimately our net income.\nImpairment of Real Estate and Related Intangible Assets. We monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable or realized. When conditions suggest that an asset group may be impaired, we compare its carrying value to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including proceeds from its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of an asset group, we record an impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group. Fair market value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to use future estimates of net operating income, expected hold period, capitalization rates and discount rates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of the assets which could impact the amount of our net income and our assets on our balance sheet.\nReal Estate Loans\nWe extend loans for purposes such as to to acquire land and to provide partial financing for the development of multifamily residential communities, student housing communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties and for other real estate or real estate related projects. Certain of these loans we extend include characteristics such as exclusive options to purchase the project within a specific time window following expected project completion and stabilization. These characteristics can cause the loans to contain variable interests and the potential of consolidation of the underlying project as a variable interest entity, or VIE. We consider the facts and circumstances pertinent to each loan, including the relative amount of financing we are contributing to the overall project cost, decision making rights or control we hold and our rights to expected residual gains or our obligations to absorb expected residual losses from the project. If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE due to holding a controlling financial interest, the majority of decision making control, or by other means, consolidation of the VIE would be required. Arriving at these conclusions requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially with regard to our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. Additionally, we analyze each loan arrangement and utilize these same assumptions and judgments for consideration of whether the loan qualifies for accounting as a loan or as an investment in a real estate development project.\nExpected Credit Losses\nThe Company carries its investments in real estate loans at amortized cost that consists of drawn amounts on the loans, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and current expected credit losses.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, that replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost, and requires entities to record credit allowances for total expected future losses on financial assets at the outset of each loan. For each loan in which the Company is the lender, the amount of protection afforded to the Company is estimated to be the excess of the future estimated fair market value of the developed property over the developer's related obligations (including the Company's mezzanine or member loan(s)), other loans senior to the Company's, the expected future balance of accrued interest and any other obligations related to the project's funding. Arriving at the future estimated fair market value of the developed property requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially regarding our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. The excess represents the amount of equity dollars in each real estate project plus profit expected to be realized by the developer on the project, both of which are in a subordinate position to the Company's real estate loan investments. This numeric result is expressed as a percentage of the developed property's future estimated fair market value (a \"percentage of protection\"), which is then pooled into ranges of loss percentages that was derived from company-specific loss experience to determine the expected credit loss for the loan ( the indicated loss reserve ratio\u201d). The product of this indicated loss reserve ratio and the expected fully-funded balance (inclusive of an expected future balance of accrued interest) is the initial total expected credit loss reserve. Over the life of the loan, the initial reserve is reevaluated for potential reduction at the achievement of certain milestones in construction and lease-up progress as the project approaches completion and the loan approaches maturity, given no unforeseen degradation in project performance or failure to adhere to the terms of the loan by the borrower/developer. Finally, the loss reserve may be further refined by the Company due to any subjective qualitative factors deemed pertinent and worthy of reflection.\nThe Company implemented this new guidance by applying this model to its existing portfolio of real estate loan investments using the modified retrospective method and in doing so, recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2020. See note 4.\nThe Company's notes and lines of credit receivable are unsecured and so are assessed for expected future credit loss by individually assessing the expected profit from current development projects in progress, as well as the viability of the personal guarantees of the borrowers.\nThe Company's real estate loan investments are collateralized by real estate development projects and secured further by guaranties of repayment from one or more of the borrowers. The Company's lines of credit receivable are typically only collateralized by personal guaranties, but occasionally may be cross-collateralized by interests in other real estate projects. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan, and/or (iii) the property's liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub market in which the borrower operates are considered. Such analyses are completed and reviewed by management, utilizing various data sources, including periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, capitalization and discount rates and site inspections.\nSee the Revenue Recognition section below for other loan-related policy disclosures required by ASC 310-10-50-6.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generally lease apartment units under leases with terms of thirteen months or less. We generally lease retail properties and office building suites for rental terms of several years. Rental revenue, net of concessions, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Differences from the straight-line method, which recognize the effect of any up-front concessions and other adjustments ratably over the lease term, are recorded in the appropriate period, to the extent that adjustments to the straight-line method are material.\nRevenue from reimbursements of retail and office building tenants' share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, or CAM, costs are recognized as the respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements. We estimate the collectability of the receivable related to rental and reimbursement billings due from tenants and straight-line rent receivables, which represent the cumulative amount of future adjustments necessary to present rental income on a straight-line basis, by taking into consideration our historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms.\nThe Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate based on the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the distinct asset, including the carrying amount of any liabilities relieved or assumed by the purchasing counterparty and net of disposition expenses.\nOther income, including interest earned on our cash, is recognized as it is earned. We recognize interest income on real estate loans on an accrual basis over the life of the loan. Loan origination fees received from borrowers as an incentive to extend the real estate loans (excluding the amounts paid to the Former Manager), are amortized over the life of the loan as an additive adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method. We stop accruing interest on loans when circumstances indicate that it is probable that the ultimate collection of all principal and interest due according to the loan agreement will not be realized, which is generally a delinquency of 30 days in required payments of interest or principal. Any payments received on such non-accrual loans are recorded as interest income or as a reduction of principal, depending upon the circumstances, when the payments are received. Interest accrual on real estate loan investments is resumed once interest and principal payments become current.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of our adoption of new accounting pronouncements, please see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nCertain financial highlights of our results of operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three months ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Revenues (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>502,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Per share data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.77) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.71) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.95) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.73) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FFO (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Core FFO (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>AFFO (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Dividends (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.2625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.7875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.0475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Per weighted average share of Common Stock outstanding for the periods indicated.\n(2) FFO, Core FFO and AFFO results are presented per basic weighted average share of Common Stock and Class A Unit in our Operating Partnership outstanding for the periods indicated. See Reconciliations of FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders, Core FFO and AFFO to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders beginning on page S-3 and Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures beginning on page S-22.\n(3) Per share of Common Stock and Class A Unit outstanding.\nFinancial\n\u2022Our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 6.8% to approximately $502.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to incremental revenues from newly acquired real estate assets. Our total revenues declined for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 versus the 2019 period due to the sale on November 3, 2020 of our eight student housing properties.\n\u2022Our net loss per share was $(0.77) and $(0.71) for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Funds From Operations, or FFO, was $(0.20) and $0.31 per weighted average share of Common Stock and Class A Unit outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in FFO per share was driven by:\n\u25e6deemed dividends resulting from our call of preferred stock and other cash redemptions of preferred stock in the fourth quarter 2020 that totaled approximately $0.49 per share;\n\u25e6decreased interest revenue from our smaller portfolio of real estate loan investments and lines of credit of approximately $0.06 per share; and\n\u25e6a gain from the sale of mortgage-backed securities in 2019 which did not recur in 2020 of approximately $0.03 per share;\n\u25e6partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.06 per share from improved property operational results and acquisitions.\n\u2022Our Core FFO per share result increased to $0.31, up 19.2% from $0.26 for the third quarter 2020, primarily due to:\n\u25e6higher purchase option termination revenue of approximately $0.02 per share;\n\u25e6land easement proceeds received in the fourth quarter 2020 of approximately $0.01 per share; and\n\u25e6reduced monthly preferred stock dividends following the call of 208,786 shares of preferred stock of approximately $0.01 per share.\n\u2022Our AFFO per share increased to $0.25 for the fourth quarter 2020 from $0.07 for the third quarter 2020, primarily due to:\n\u25e6an increase of accrued interest received of approximately $0.07 per share;\n\u25e6higher purchase option termination revenue of approximately $0.02 per share;\n\u25e6land easement proceeds received in the fourth quarter 2020 of approximately $0.01 per share;\n\u25e6reduced monthly preferred stock dividends following the call of 208,786 shares of preferred stock of approximately $0.01 per share; and\n\u25e6lower recurring capital expenditures on our real estate properties of approximately $0.02 per share.\n\u2022Our Core FFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 57.9% and our Core FFO payout ratio to our preferred stockholders was approximately 78.4% for the fourth quarter 2020. (A)\n\u2022Our AFFO payout ratio to our preferred stockholders improved to approximately 81.7% for the fourth quarter 2020 from 90.9% for the third quarter 2020.(A) Our fourth quarter 2020 AFFO payout ratio reflects an increase of accrued interest received on our real estate loan investment portfolio of approximately $3.5 million versus the third quarter 2020. We have approximately $22.5 million of accrued interest revenue on our real estate loan investment portfolio, that will positively impact AFFO when collected.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, our total assets were approximately $4.3 billion, a decrease from our total assets of approximately $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019 that mainly resulted from the sale of our student housing portfolio during the fourth quarter 2020 and the utilization of proceeds to fund a call of 208,786 shares of our preferred stock.\n(A) We calculate the Core FFO and AFFO payout ratios to Common Stockholders as the ratio of Common Stock dividends and distributions to Core FFO and AFFO. We calculate the Core FFO and AFFO payout ratios to preferred stockholders as the ratio of Preferred Stock dividends to the sum of Preferred Stock dividends and Core FFO and AFFO. Since our operations resulted in a net loss from continuing operations for the periods presented, a payout ratio based on net loss is not calculable. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures on page S-22.\nThe following chart details monthly cash collections of rental revenues before and after the effect of rent deferrals across all our operating

same store net operating income increased 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus 2019. For the fourth quarter, same store revenues increased 0.1% and same store net operating income decreased 1.9%. Real estate taxes and insurance costs increased 22% and 24%,\nrespectively for the quarter and 6% and 26% respectively for the year to date periods in 2020 due to our increased exposure from property tax judgements that are currently in litigation or under appeal and from increased insurance costs related to adjustments for replacement cost underwriting results. Decreases in property operating and maintenance expense resulted from cost savings realized from the absence of property management fees to our Former Manager following Internalization and reduced advertising and marketing expenditures.\n\u2022We collected 99% of rental revenues from residents in our multifamily communities for each month in 2020.\n\u2022Our average recurring rental revenue collections before and after any effect of rent deferrals for the fourth quarter 2020 were approximately 99.1% and 99.1% for multifamily communities, 97.4% and 98.1% for grocery-anchored retail properties and 99.7% and 99.7% for office properties, respectively. Rent deferments provided to our residents and tenants are limited and are primarily related to a change of timing of rent payments with no significant changes to total payments or term.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $1.9 million of retail recurring rental revenue, or approximately 2.7% cumulatively over the last three quarters. Including this deferred rent, we have accounted for 98.1%, 97.6% and 96.8% of fourth quarter, third quarter and second quarter retail recurring rental revenue, respectively. In addition to the deferrals, we granted approximately $542,000 of Covid-related rental abatements, or approximately 0.8% of retail recurring rental revenues cumulatively over the last three quarters. These rental abatements were generally accompanied by an increase in the tenant's lease term or the lease terms were amended to be more favorable to us. Our total retail reserves held steady at $2.5 million, or 2.3% of total retail revenues year to date, which is 0.6% of total company rental and other property revenues.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter 2020, we received the full principal amounts totaling $44.6 million from the repayment of the Sanibel Straights, E-Town and Solis Kennesaw II real estate loan investments, plus approximately $4.2 million of deferred interest revenue from these loans. These transactions collectively returned $48.8 million of capital to us for investment during the fourth quarter.\n\u2022For the full year 2020, we originated three real estate investment loans with a total commitment of $44.1 million.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, the average age of our multifamily communities was approximately 6.3 years, which is the youngest in the public multifamily REIT industry.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, all of our owned multifamily communities had achieved stabilization except for our two fourth quarter acquisitions, which we define as reaching 93% physical occupancy for three full months in a quarter. One fourth quarter multifamily acquisition will achieve stabilization on March 31, 2021, at which time we will have owned it for a full fiscal quarter.\n\u2022The physical occupancy of our same-store multifamily communities increased to 95.4% at December 31, 2020 from 95.3% at December 31, 2019.\nFinancing and Capital Markets\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, approximately 97.4% of our permanent property-level mortgage debt has fixed interest rates and approximately 0.8% has variable interest rates which are capped. We believe we are well protected against potential increases in market interest rates. Our overall weighted average interest rate for our mortgage debt portfolio was 3.55% for multifamily communities, 4.13% for office properties, 3.91% for grocery-anchored retail properties and 3.77% in the aggregate.\n\u2022At December 31, 2020, our leverage, as measured by the ratio of our debt to the undepreciated book value of our total assets, was approximately 55.6%.\n\u2022At December 31, 2020, we had $178.0 million available to be drawn on our revolving line of credit and approximately $75.7 million of cash and restricted cash.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 52,333 shares of Preferred Stock and redeemed an aggregate of 49,105 shares of Preferred Stock, resulting in a net issuance of 3,228 shares of Preferred Stock. Also during the fourth quarter 2020, we called 208,786 shares of Preferred Stock for a net decrease of 205,558 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding and a net cash disbursement of approximately $209.3 million from these transactions.\nSignificant Transactions\n\u2022On November 3, 2020, we announced via a press release the closing on that day of the sale of all of our student housing properties and one student housing related real estate loan investment to an unrelated third party for a sales price of $478.7 million.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter 2020, we acquired The Blake, a 281-unit multifamily community located in Orlando, Florida and The Menlo, a 332-unit multifamily community located in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\u2022On November 12, 2020, we closed on the sale of the Avenues at Creekside, a 395-unit multifamily community located in San Antonio, Texas that resulted in a gain of approximately $17.3 million.\n\u2022On November 19, 2020, we announced an approval by our common stockholders of a reduction of our call option on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock from 10 years to 5 years.\n\u2022On November 19, 2020, we announced a call of approximately $208.8 million of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter 2020, we received approximately $48.8 million in full satisfaction of the principal and all interest due on four previously issued real estate loan investments.\nYears ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019\nThe following discussion and tabular presentations highlight the major drivers behind the line item changes in our

primarily due to properties acquired since January 1, 2019. These increases occurred in multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office buildings, which accounted for most of our acquisition activity since January 1, 2019.\nOur average recurring rental revenue collections before and after any effect of rent deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately 99.2% and 99.3% respectively for multifamily communities, 99.4% and 99.9% for office properties and 96.1% and 98.0% for grocery-anchored retail properties, respectively. Rent deferments provided to residents and tenants primarily related to a change of timing of rent payments with no significant changes to total payments or term. The Company has deferred approximately $2.7 million, or 0.6% of total rental and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company's revenues were reduced by approximately $3.9 million, or 0.9% of rental and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to additional bad debt reserves related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also collect revenue from residents and tenants for items such as utilities, application fees, lease termination fees, common area maintenance reimbursements and late charges. The increases in these other property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus 2019 were primarily due to the acquisitions listed above.\nChanges in occupancy rates and in percentages of leased space and rent growth are the primary drivers of changes in rental revenue from our owned properties. Factors which we believe affect market rents include vacant unit inventory in local markets, local and national economic growth and resultant employment stability, income levels and growth, the ease of obtaining credit for home purchases, and changes in demand due to consumer confidence in the above factors.\nInterest income\nInterest income from our real estate loan investments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus 2019, largely due to the decrease in principal amount outstanding to $290.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $352.6 million at December 31, 2019.\nRevenues from the amortization of terminated purchase options decreased from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized purchase option termination revenue of approximately $0.7 million that will be recognized by December 31, 2021.\nWe recorded interest income and other revenue from these instruments as presented in Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMiscellaneous revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of forfeited earnest money deposits from prospective purchasers of six of our student housing properties and the addition of new revenue streams from Internalization, including third party property management fee revenues and revenues from subleasing space in the corporate office. Miscellaneous revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included proceeds from a land easement at one of our multifamily properties.\nProperty operating and maintenance\nThe primary components of operating and maintenance expense are utilities, property repairs, and landscaping costs. The expenses incurred for property repairs and, to a lesser extent, utilities could generally be expected to increase gradually over time as the buildings and properties age. Utility costs may generally be expected to increase in future periods as rate increases from providing carriers are passed on to our residents and tenants.\nProperty salary and benefits\nWe recorded property salary and benefits expense for individuals who handle the on-site management, operations and maintenance of our properties. These costs increased primarily due to the incremental costs brought on by additional personnel necessary to manage and operate properties acquired.\nProperty management costs\nWe paid fees for property management services to our Former Manager in an amount of 4% of gross property revenues as compensation for services such as rental, leasing, operation and management of our multifamily communities and the supervision of any subcontractors; for grocery-anchored shopping center assets, property management fees were generally 4% of gross property revenues, of which generally 2.0% to 2.5% were paid to a third party management company. Property management fees for office building assets are 1.25% to 2.00% and are paid to a third party property management company. All property management fees paid to our Former Manager ceased effective with our Internalization on January 31, 2020, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $9.0 million in these property management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019.\nReal estate taxes and insurance\nWe are liable for property taxes due to the various counties and municipalities that levy such taxes on real property for each of our properties. Real estate taxes rose primarily due to the incremental costs brought on by properties acquired since January 1, 2019 and secondarily due to reassessments for existing properties. We generally expect the assessed values of our properties to rise over time, owing to our expectation of improving market conditions, as well as pressure on municipalities to raise revenues. Insurance premiums are paid to insure against damages to our real estate assets and for liability claims.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increases in general and administrative expenses were due to charges for corporate salaries and administrative expenses that are borne by us following the Internalization.\nEquity compensation to directors and executives\nEquity compensation expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the recognition of expense related to a grant of 482,097 shares of restricted stock that were issued to employees on June 17, 2020 and a grant of 272,929 performance-based restricted stock units that were issued to certain named executive officers on July 31, 2020. This increase in equity compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in recognition of expense relating to Class B Unit grants. The last Class B Unit grant to be issued was in 2018, and the final one-third of the expense related to this grant was recorded in 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increases in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the addition of properties acquired since January 1, 2019.\nAsset management fees and general and administrative fees to related party\nMonthly asset management fees and general and administrative expense fees ceased effective with the closing of our Internalization transaction on January 31, 2020.\nProvision for expected credit losses\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-03, which requires us to estimate the amount of future credit losses we expect to incur over the lives of our real estate loan investments at the inception of each loan, rather than perform assessments for impairment as circumstances dictate. The Company's opening reserve of approximately $7.4 million was recorded as a cumulative adjustment to accumulated earnings on January 1, 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an aggregate net increase in its provisions for expected credit losses of approximately $4.5 million, primarily related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an aggregate net decrease in its provision for expected credit losses of approximately $2.9 million, primarily related to updates to our estimates to the valuations of the underlying development projects (reversal of some previous adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as projects achieving construction and leasing milestones.\nManagement Internalization expense\nOn January 31, 2020, we internalized the functions performed by the Former Manager and the Former Sub-Manager by acquiring the entities that own the Former Manager and the Former Sub-Manager for an aggregate purchase price of $154 million, plus up to $25 million of additional consideration to be paid within 36 months.\nInterest expense\nThe increase consisted of interest expense on mortgage indebtedness that increased from $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the additional acquired properties in 2020. Additionally, our Revolving Line of Credit carried a higher balance for 2020 over 2019, resulting in an additional $2.6 million in interest expense.\nSee the sections entitled Contractual Obligations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nLosses on extinguishment of debt\nThe increase consisted of losses incurred on the refinancing of mortgage debt on nine of our multifamily communities during 2020.\nYears ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018\nPlease refer to Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, that was filed on March 3, 2020 for a discussion and tabular presentations highlighting the major drivers behind the line item changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 versus 2018.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe disclose FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI, each of which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure\u201d, as set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result we are required to include in this filing a statement of why the Company believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. The non-GAAP measures of FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ( FFO\u201d)\nFFO is one of the most commonly utilized Non-GAAP measures currently in practice. In its 2002 White Paper on Funds From Operations,\u201d which was restated in 2018, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, standardized the definition of how Net income/loss should be adjusted to arrive at FFO, in the interests of uniformity and comparability. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO as a meaningful supplemental gauge of our operating results, and as is most often presented by other REIT industry participants.\nThe NAREIT definition of FFO (and the one reported by the Company) is:\nNet income/loss, excluding:\n\u2022depreciation and amortization related to real estate;\n\u25e6gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets;\n\u25e6gains and losses from change in control and\n\u25e6impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.\nNot all companies necessarily utilize the standardized NAREIT definition of FFO, so caution should be taken in comparing the Company's reported FFO results to those of other companies. The Company's FFO results are comparable to the\nFFO results of other companies that follow the NAREIT definition of FFO and report these figures on that basis. FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders.\nCore Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ( Core FFO\u201d)\nThe Company makes adjustments to FFO to remove costs incurred and revenues recorded that are singular in nature and outside the normal operations of the Company and portray its primary operational results. The Company calculates Core FFO as:\nFFO, plus:\n\u2022 acquisition and pursuit (dead deal) costs;\n\u2022 loan cost amortization on acquisition term notes and loan coordination fees;\n\u2022 contingent management fees recognized upon property sales;\n\u2022 losses on debt extinguishments or refinancing costs;\n\u2022 internalization costs;\n\u2022 expenses incurred on calls of preferred stock;\n\u2022 deemed dividends for redemptions of and non-cash dividends on preferred stock;\n\u2022 expenses related to the COVID-19 global pandemic; and\nLess:\n\u2022 earnest money forfeitures by prospective asset purchasers.\nCore FFO figures reported by us may not be comparable to Core FFO figures reported by other companies. We utilize Core FFO as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of our portfolio of real estate assets. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and may be useful in comparing our operating performance with other real estate companies. Since our calculation of Core FFO removes costs incurred and revenues recorded that are often singular in nature and outside the normal operations of the Company, we believe it improves comparability to investors in assessing our core operating results across periods. Core FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ( AFFO\u201d)\nAFFO makes further adjustments to Core FFO results in order to arrive at a more refined measure of operating and financial performance. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. The Company calculates AFFO as:\nCore FFO, plus:\n\u2022 non-cash equity compensation to directors and executives;\n\u2022 non-cash (income) expense for current expected credit losses;\n\u2022 amortization of loan closing costs;\n\u2022 depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets;\n\u2022 net loan origination fees received;\n\u2022 accrued interest income received;\n\u2022 amortization of lease inducements;\n\u2022 cash received for purchase option terminations;\n\u2022 non-operating miscellaneous revenues;\nLess:\n\u2022 non-cash loan interest income;\n\u2022 cash paid for loan closing costs;\n\u2022 amortization of acquired real estate intangible liabilities;\n\u2022 amortization of straight line rent adjustments and deferred revenues; and\n\u2022 normally-recurring capital expenditures and capitalized second generation leasing costs.\nAFFO figures reported by us may not be comparable to those AFFO figures reported by other companies. We utilize AFFO as another measure of the operating performance of our portfolio of real estate assets. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and may be useful in comparing our operating performance with other real estate companies. Since our calculation of AFFO removes other significant non-cash charges and revenues and other costs which are not representative of our ongoing business operations, we believe it improves comparability to investors in assessing our core operating results across periods. AFFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP\nmeasure, net income/loss available to common stockholders. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common stockholders.\nNotes to Reconciliations of FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders, Core FFO and AFFO to\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\n1)Rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2020 include activity for the properties acquired during the period only from their respective dates of acquisition. In addition, these periods include activity for the properties acquired since December 31, 2019. Rental and other property revenues and expenses for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2019 include activity for the acquisitions made during that period only from their respective dates of acquisition.\n2)Non-controlling interests in Preferred Apartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., or our Operating Partnership, consisted of a total of 648,936 Class A Units as of December 31, 2020. Included in this total are 419,228 Class A Units which were granted as partial consideration to the seller in conjunction with the seller's contribution to us on February 29, 2016 of the Wade Green grocery-anchored shopping center. The remaining Class A units were awarded primarily to our key executive officers. The Class A Units are apportioned a percentage of our financial results as non-controlling interests. The weighted average ownership percentage of these holders of Class A Units was calculated to be 1.44% and 1.54% for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n3) We paid loan coordination fees to Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC, or our Former Manager, to reflect the administrative effort involved in arranging debt financing for acquired properties prior to the Internalization. The fees were calculated as 0.6% of the amount of any mortgage indebtedness on newly-acquired properties or refinancing and are amortized over the lives of the respective mortgage loans. This non-cash amortization expense is an addition to FFO in the calculation of Core FFO and AFFO. At December 31, 2020, aggregate unamortized loan coordination fees were approximately $11.7 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 10.5 years.\n4) This adjustment reflects the add-back of (i) consideration paid to the owners of the Former Manager and Former Sub-Manager, (ii) accretion of the discount on the deferred liability payable to the owners of the Former Manager and (iii) due diligence and pursuit costs incurred by the Company related to the internalization of the functions performed by the Former Manager.\n5) This adjustment adds back expenses incurred by us to effect an amendment of the Company's charter necessary to allow us to redeem outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock beginning on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, rather than the tenth anniversary.\n6) This additive adjustment to FFO consists of non-recurring costs for signage, cleaning and supplies necessary to create and maintain work environments necessary to adhere to CDC guidelines during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since we do not expect to incur similar costs once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we add these costs back to FFO in our calculation of Core FFO.\n7) Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-03, which requires us to estimate the amount of future credit losses we expect to incur over the lives of our real estate loan investments at the inception of each loan. This loss reserve may be adjusted upward or downward over the lives of our loans and therefore the aggregate net adjustment for each period could be positive (removing the non-cash effect of a net increase in aggregate loss reserves) or negative (removing the non-cash effect of a net decrease in aggregate loss reserves) in these adjustments to FFO in calculating Core FFO. More information on our expected credit loss reserves may be found in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\n8) We incur loan closing costs on our existing mortgage loans, which are secured on a property-by-property basis by each of our acquired real estate assets, and also for occasional amendments to our syndicated revolving line of credit with Key Bank National Association, or our Revolving Line of Credit. These loan closing costs are also amortized over the lives of the respective loans and the Revolving Line of Credit, and this non-cash amortization expense is an addition to FFO in the calculation of AFFO. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership have any recourse liability in connection with any of the mortgage loans, nor do we have any cross-collateralization arrangements with respect to the assets securing the mortgage loans, other than security interests in 49% of the equity interests of the subsidiaries owning such assets, granted in connection with our Revolving Line of Credit, which provides for full recourse liability. At December 31, 2020, unamortized loan costs on all the Company's indebtedness were approximately $31.1 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 9.0 years.\n9) We receive loan origination fees in conjunction with the origination of certain real estate loan investments. These fees are then recognized as revenue over the lives of the applicable loans as adjustments of yield using the effective interest\nmethod. The total fees received are additive adjustments in the calculation of AFFO. Correspondingly, the amortized non-cash income is a deduction in the calculation of AFFO. Over the lives of certain loans, we accrue additional interest amounts that become due to us at the time of repayment of the loan or refinancing of the property, or when the property is sold. This non-cash interest income is subtracted from Core FFO in our calculation of AFFO. The amount of additional accrued interest becomes an additive adjustment to FFO once received from the borrower (see note 10).\n10) This adjustment reflects the receipt during the periods presented of additional interest income (described in note 9 above) which was earned and accrued on various real estate loans prior to those periods and previously deducted in our calculation of AFFO.\n11) This adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of costs incurred to induce tenants to lease space in our office buildings and grocery-anchored shopping centers.\n12) Occasionally we receive fees in exchange for the termination of our purchase options related to certain multifamily and student housing properties. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period beginning on the date of termination until the earlier of (i) the maturity of the real estate loan investment and (ii) the sale of the property. The receipt of the cash termination fees are an additive adjustment in our calculation of AFFO and the removal of non-cash revenue from the recognition of the termination fees are a reduction to Core FFO in our calculation of AFFO; both of these adjustments are presented in a single net number within this line. For periods in which recognized termination fee revenues exceeded the amount of cash received, a negative adjustment is shown to Core FFO in our calculation of AFFO; for periods in which cash received exceeded the amount of recognized termination fee revenues, an additive adjustment is shown to Core FFO in our calculation of AFFO.\n13) This adjustment reflects straight-line rent adjustments and the reversal of the non-cash amortization of below-market and above-market lease intangibles, which were recognized in conjunction with our acquisitions and which are amortized over the estimated average remaining lease terms from the acquisition date for multifamily communities and over the remaining lease terms for grocery-anchored shopping center assets and office buildings. At December 31, 2020, the balance of unamortized below-market lease intangibles was approximately $51.9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining lease period of approximately 8.7 years.\n14) This adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of deferred revenue recorded by us in conjunction with Company-owned lessee-funded tenant improvements in our office buildings.\n15) We deduct from Core FFO normally recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain our assets' revenue streams in the calculation of AFFO. This adjustment also deducts from Core FFO capitalized amounts for third party costs during the period to originate or renew leases in our grocery-anchored shopping centers and office buildings. This adjustment includes approximately $31,000 and $131,000 of recurring capitalized expenditures incurred at our corporate offices during the three-months and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. No adjustment is made in the calculation of AFFO for nonrecurring capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures, Grocery-Anchored Shopping Center Portfolio, and Office Buildings Portfolio sections for definitions of these terms.\n16) Units and Unitholders refer to Class A Units in our Operating Partnership (as defined in note 2), or Class A Units, and holders of Class A Units, respectively. Unitholders include recipients of awards of Class B Units in our Operating Partnership, or Class B Units, for annual service which became vested and earned and automatically converted to Class A Units. Unitholders also include the entity that contributed the Wade Green grocery-anchored shopping center.\n17) Since our AFFO results are positive for the periods reflected, we are presenting recalculated diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock and Class A Units for these periods for purposes of this table, which includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents from grants of the Class B Units, warrants included in units of Series A Preferred Stock issued, as well as annual grants of restricted Common Stock and restricted stock units. The weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are the same for basic and diluted for any period for which we recorded a net loss available to common stockholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort-Term Liquidity\nWe believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:\n\u2022operating expenses directly related to our portfolio of multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties (including regular maintenance items);\n\u2022operating expenses related to salaries, benefits, and general and administrative expenses (that were formerly funded by payment of fees to our Former Manager prior to Internalization on January 31, 2020);\n\u2022capital expenditures incurred to lease our multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties;\n\u2022interest expense on our outstanding property level debt;\n\u2022amounts due on our Credit Facility;\n\u2022distributions that we pay to our preferred stockholders, common stockholders, and unitholders;\n\u2022cash redemptions that we may pay to our preferred stockholders, and\n\u2022committed investments.\nWe have a credit facility, or Credit Facility, with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank, which defines a revolving line of credit, or Revolving Line of Credit, which is used to fund investments, capital expenditures, dividends (with consent of KeyBank), working capital and other general corporate purposes on an as-needed basis. The maximum borrowing capacity on the Revolving Line of Credit is $200 million subset to an accordion feature that permits the maximum borrowing capacity to be expanded or contracted without amending any further terms of the instrument. The maturity date is December 12, 2021, with an option to extend the maturity date to December 12, 2022, pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions described therein. The Revolving Line of Credit accrues interest at a variable rate of one month LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.50% per annum, depending upon our leverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate for the Revolving Line of Credit was 3.85% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also reduced the commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit to 0.25% or 0.30% per annum, depending upon our outstanding Credit Facility balance.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants including negative covenants that limit or restrict secured and unsecured indebtedness, mergers and fundamental changes, investments and acquisitions, liens and encumbrances, dividends, transactions with affiliates, burdensome agreements, changes in fiscal year and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The material financial covenants include minimum net worth and debt service coverage ratios and maximum leverage and dividend payout ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our results with respect to such compliance are presented in Note 9 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn December 20, 2019, the Company entered into a $70.0 million interim term loan with KeyBank, or the 2019 Term Loan, to partially finance the acquisition of Morrocroft Centre, an office building located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 2019 Term Loan accrued interest at an average variable rate of 3.2% per annum until it was repaid in conjunction with the closing of permanent mortgage financing for Morrocroft Centre on March 19, 2020.\nOn February 28, 2017, we entered into a revolving acquisition credit agreement, or Acquisition Credit Agreement, with KeyBank to obtain the Acquisition Facility, with a maximum borrowing capacity of $200 million. The sole purpose of the Acquisition Credit Agreement is to finance our acquisitions of multifamily communities and student housing communities prior to obtaining permanent conventional mortgage financing on the acquired assets. The maximum borrowing capacity on the Acquisition Facility was reduced by agreement with KeyBank to $90 million on March 25, 2019. The Acquisition Facility accrues interest at a variable rate of one month LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.75% per annum and 2.20% per annum, depending on the type of assets acquired and the resulting property debt service coverage ratio. The Acquisition Facility has a maturity date of March 1, 2022 and has two one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions described therein. At September 30, 2020, we had $90.0 million available to be drawn by us on the Acquisition Facility.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $47.9 million, $145.6 million and $145.4 million, respectively. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect the $111.1 million one-time cash payments to the entities that owned the Former Manager and\nFormer Sub-Manager for the closing of the Internalization transaction, as well as approximately $3.8 million in professional fees related to the transaction.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases at our multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties. Therefore, our operating cash flow is principally dependent on: (1) the number of multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties in our portfolio; (2) rental rates; (3) occupancy rates; (4) operating expenses associated with these properties; and (5) the ability of our residents and tenants to make their rental payments.\nWe also earn interest revenue from the issuance of real estate-related loans and may receive fees at the inception of these loans for committing and originating them. Interest revenue we receive on these loans is influenced by (1) market interest rates on similar loans; (2) the availability of credit from alternative financing sources; (3) the desire of borrowers to finance new real estate projects; and (4) unique characteristics attached to these loans, such as exclusive purchase options. In the course of extending real estate loan investments for property development, we will often receive an exclusive option to purchase the property once development and stabilization are complete. If we do not wish to acquire the property, we have the right to sell the purchase option back to the borrower for a termination fee in the amount of the purchase option discount, which is recognized as interest income over the earlier of the maturity date of the loan or the sale of the property.\nInterest income on our loans and notes receivable was $50.8 million, $61.5 million and $65.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, reflecting a decrease in the principal amounts outstanding on our portfolio of real estate loan investments.\nOur net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $244.1 million and net cash disbursed was $661.1 million and $881.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash proceeds of $515.5 million in 2020 reflected the sales of our Student Housing assets and our Avenues at Creekside multifamily community.\nCash used in investing activities is primarily driven by acquisitions and dispositions of multifamily properties, office properties and grocery-anchored shopping centers and acquisitions and maturities or other dispositions of real estate loans and other real estate and real estate-related assets, and secondarily by capital expenditures related to our owned properties. We will seek to acquire more multifamily communities, office properties and grocery-anchored shopping centers at costs that we expect will be accretive to our financial results. Capital expenditures may be nonrecurring and discretionary, as part of a strategic plan intended to increase a property's value and corresponding revenue-generating power, or may be normally recurring and necessary to maintain the income streams and present value of a property. Certain capital expenditures may be budgeted and reserved for upon acquiring a property as initial expenditures necessary to bring a property up to our standards or to add features or amenities that we believe make the property a compelling value to prospective residents or tenants in its individual market. These budgeted nonrecurring capital expenditures in connection with an acquisition are funded from the capital source(s) for the acquisition and are not dependent upon subsequent property operational cash flows for funding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our capital expenditures for our multifamily communities, not including changes in related payables were as follows:\nTable 25:

capital expenditures within our grocery-anchored shopping center portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled $2.5 million, $1.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We define second-generation capital expenditures as those that exclude expenditures made in our grocery-anchored shopping center portfolio (i) to lease space to \"first generation\" tenants (i.e. leasing capital for existing vacancies and known move-outs at the time of acquisition), (ii) to bring recently acquired properties up to our ownership standards, and (iii) for property re-developments and repositioning.\nSecond-generation capital expenditures within our office properties portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled $1.1 million, $1.7 million and $152,000, respectively. Second-generation capital expenditures exclude those expenditures made in our office properties portfolio (i) to lease space to \"first generation\" tenants (i.e. leasing capital for existing vacancies and known move-outs at the time of acquisition), (ii) to bring recently acquired properties up to our Class A ownership standards (and which amounts were underwritten into the total investment at the time of acquisition) and (iii) for property re-developments and repositionings.\nIncluded in our aggregate restricted cash of approximately $47.1 million at December 31, 2020 was approximately $14.4 million that was contractually restricted to fund capital expenditures and other property-level commitments such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nNet cash used in financing activities was approximately $353.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $565.0 million and $751.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our significant financing cash uses during 2020 included cash redemptions of preferred stock of $314.2 million.\nDistributions\nIn order to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must comply with a number of organizational and operating requirements, including a requirement to distribute 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on the taxable income we distribute to our stockholders. Generally, our objective is to meet our short-term liquidity requirement of funding the payment of our quarterly Common Stock dividends, as well as monthly dividends to holders of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, mShares, Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock (collectively, our Preferred Stock), through net cash generated from operating results.\nOur board of directors reviews the Preferred Stock dividends monthly to determine whether we have funds legally available for payment of such dividends in cash, and there can be no assurance that the Preferred Stock dividends will consistently be paid in cash. Dividends may be paid as a combination of cash and stock in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirements applicable to REITs. We expect the aggregate dollar amount of monthly Preferred Stock dividend payments to increase at a rate that approximates the rate at which we issue new shares of Preferred Stock, less those shares redeemed.\nOur fourth quarter 2020 Common Stock dividend declaration was $0.175 per share. Our board of directors reviews the proposed Common Stock dividend declarations quarterly, and there can be no assurance that the current dividend level will be maintained.\nWe believe that our short-term liquidity needs are and will continue to be adequately funded.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our aggregate dividends and distributions totaled approximately $200.4 million and our cash flows from operating activities were approximately $47.9 million. The full year 2020 numbers were negatively impacted by the cash outlays related to Internalization of approximately $115.0 million and deemed dividends totaling approximately $30.4 million. We expect our cash flow from operations over time to be sufficient to fund our quarterly Common Stock dividends, Class A Unit distributions and our monthly Preferred Stock dividends.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nWe believe our principal long-term liquidity needs are to fund:\n\u2022the principal amount of our long-term debt as it becomes due or matures;\n\u2022capital expenditures needed for our multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties;\n\u2022Costs associated with current and future capital raising activities, including any potential redemptions or calls of our preferred stock; and\n\u2022Costs to acquire additional multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers, office properties or other real estate, enter into new and fund existing lending opportunities; and\nour minimum distributions necessary to maintain our REIT status.\nWe intend to finance our future investments with the net proceeds from sales of currently owned real estate assets, additional issuances of our securities, including our Series A1/M1 Offering (as defined and described in note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), Common Stock, and units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, and/or borrowings. The success of our acquisition strategy may depend, in part, on our ability to access further capital through issuances of additional securities. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional funds, we may not be able to obtain any assets in addition to those we have acquired.\nOn September 27, 2019, our registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-233576) (the Series A1/M1 Registration Statement\u201d) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). The Series A1/M1 Registration Statement allows us to offer up to a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock or a combination of both. The stated price per share is $1,000, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The shares are being offered by our affiliate, Preferred Capital Securities, LLC ( PCS\u201d), on a \"reasonable best efforts\" basis and we intend to invest substantially all the net proceeds of the Series A1/M1 Offering in connection with the acquisition of multifamily communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers, office buildings, real estate loans and mortgages, other real estate-related investments and general working capital purposes.\nPursuant to FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5), which became effective April 11, 2016, and as described in Regulatory Notice 15-02, we have prepared for our stockholders an estimate of the per share value of our Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2020. This estimate is based on dividing (i) the value of our assets less contractual liabilities as of December 31, 2020, by (ii) the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of that date. We used a direct capitalization appraised value analysis for this purpose. This methodology was prepared with the material assistance and confirmation of a third party valuation expert pursuant to FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5) and NASD Rule 2340(c). We believe this methodology conforms to standard industry practices. Based on the foregoing, we have determined that the estimated value as of December 31, 2020 of our Preferred Stock is $1,000 per share (unaudited).\nFor any property owned for less than 12 months, we used the market value of that property as reflected in the third party appraisal we had received at the time of acquisition to value the property. For properties owned more than 12 months, the direct capitalization value method was used. Under the direct capitalization value analysis, we utilized the trailing 12-month net operating income from the property, adjusted for rare or catastrophic events, such as hurricane damages, as needed, to arrive at a normalized net operating income. The Company then determines the current market capitalization rate for each property. The property's normalized net operating income is divided by the capitalization rate for that property to determine a fair market value for each property. The fair market value of all the properties was then added to the value of our other assets (i.e., the value of our cash on hand and other financial assets as reflected on our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020) to determine the aggregate market value of our assets. We then subtracted our contractual liabilities from the aggregate market value of our assets, and divided the difference by the number of shares of our Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 to determine our estimated per share value of our Preferred Stock as of that date.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's active equity offerings consisted of:\n\u2022an offering of up to 1,000,000 Shares of Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series A1 Preferred Stock\"), Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series M1 Preferred Stock\"), or a combination of both (collectively the \"Series A1/M1 Offering\");\n\u2022an offering of up to $400 million of equity or debt securities (the \"2019 Shelf Offering\"), including an offering of up to $125 million of Common Stock from time to time in an \"at the market\" offering (the \"2019 ATM Offering\"); and\n\u2022an offering of up to $100 million of equity securities for the Preferred Office Growth Fund, a consolidated entity (the \"Preferred Office Growth Fund Offering\").\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 617,306 shares of our common stock under our 2019 ATM Offering and collected proceeds of approximately $4.5 million.\nOur ability to raise funds through the issuance of our securities is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about us, and the current trading price of our Common Stock. We will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any point in time, but the equity and credit markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive to us or at all.\nThe sources to fulfill our long-term liquidity in the future may include borrowings from a number of sources, including repurchase agreements, securitizations, resecuritizations, warehouse facilities and credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), in addition to our Revolving Line of Credit. We have utilized, and we intend to continue to utilize, leverage in making our investments in multifamily communities, office properties and retail shopping centers. The number of different multifamily communities, retail shopping centers, office properties and other investments we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including the amount of funds available to us. By operating on a leveraged basis, we will have more funds available for our investments. This will allow us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a larger and more diversified portfolio.\nWe intend to target leverage levels (secured and unsecured) between 50% and 65% of the fair market value of our tangible assets (including our real estate assets, real estate loans, notes receivable, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents) on a portfolio basis. Neither our charter nor our by-laws contain any limitation on the amount of leverage we may use. These targets, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.\nThe amount of leverage we will place on individual investments will depend on our assessment of a variety of factors which may include:\n\u2022The anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio;\n\u2022The potential for losses and loan extension risk in the portfolio;\n\u2022The availability and cost of financing an asset;\n\u2022Our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties; and\n\u2022The health of the U.S. economy and the health of the commercial real estate market in general.\nIn addition, factors such as our outlook on interest rates, changes to the yield curve, the level and volatility of interest rates and their associated credit spreads, the underlying value of our assets and our outlook on credit spreads relative to our outlook on interest rate and economic performance could all impact our decision and strategy for financing the target assets. At the date of acquisition of an asset, we anticipate that the investment cost for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value. However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. Finally, we intend to acquire all our real estate assets through separate single purpose entities and we intend to finance each of these assets using debt financing techniques for that asset alone without any cross-collateralization to our other real estate assets or any guarantees by us or our Operating Partnership. We intend to have no long-term unsecured debt at the Company or Operating Partnership levels, except for our Revolving Line of Credit. Our secured and unsecured aggregate borrowings are intended by us to be reasonable in relation to our tangible assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. In determining whether our borrowings are reasonable in relation to our tangible assets, we expect that our board of directors will consider many factors, including without limitation the lending standards of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for loans in connection with the financing of multifamily properties, the leverage ratios of publicly traded and non-traded REITs with similar investment strategies, and general market conditions. There is no limitation on the amount that we may borrow for any single investment.\nOur ability to incur additional debt is dependent on a number of factors, including our credit ratings (if any), the value of our assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders. We will continue to monitor the debt markets, including Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac (who have been a significant and consistent source of financing to the company and the multifamily market generally), and as market conditions permit, access borrowings that are advantageous to us. It is important to note that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are both GSEs (Government Sponsored Entities). GSE reform has been a topic of debate in Congress for several years now and it is possible that Congress or FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency) could materially change the terms and/or availability of mortgage debt to the multifamily industry. Changes could materially affect our ability to acquire or refinance assets.\nIf we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, we may have to curtail our investment activities, including acquisitions and improvements to real properties, which could limit our growth prospects. This, in turn, could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more securities or borrowing more money. We may be forced to dispose of assets at inopportune times in order to maintain our REIT qualification and Investment Company Act exemption. Our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to REITs. We may not be able to sell a property or properties as quickly as we would like or on terms as favorable as we would like.\nFurthermore, if interest rates or other factors at the time of financing result in higher costs of financing, then the interest expense relating to that financed indebtedness would be higher. Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well. If interest rates increase, our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase, which could\nadversely affect our transaction and development activity, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Finally, sellers may be less inclined to offer to sell to us if they believe we may be unable to obtain financing.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had long term mortgage indebtedness of approximately $2.6 billion, all of which was incurred by us in connection with the acquisition or refinancing of our real estate properties.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $28.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We believe that our long-term liquidity needs are and will continue to be adequately funded through the sources discussed above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,300,314 outstanding Warrants from our sales of Series A Preferred Stock Units. The Warrants are exercisable by the holder at an exercise price of 120% of the current market price per share of the Common Stock on the date of issuance of such Warrant, with a minimum exercise price of $19.50 per share for Warrants issued after February 15, 2017. The current market price per share is determined using the closing market price of the Common Stock immediately preceding the issuance of the Warrant. The Warrants are not exercisable until one year following the date of issuance and expire four years following the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 531,522 Warrants had been exercised into 10,630,440 shares of Common stock. The 1,300,314 Warrants outstanding at December 31, 2020 have exercise prices that range between $16.64 and $26.34 per share. If all the Warrants outstanding at December 31, 2020 became exercisable and were exercised, gross proceeds to us would be approximately $522.8 million and we would as a result issue an additional 26,006,280 shares of Common Stock.\nContractual Obligations\nPlease see note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our contractual obligations.\nBased on a LIBOR rate of 0.14% at December 31, 2020, our estimated future required payments on these instruments were:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than one year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than five years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,640,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>347,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,002,414 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,662,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>347,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,002,414 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>355,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>355,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we had unfunded real estate loan balances totaling approximately $44.4 million at December 31, 2020.", "summary": "The report discusses significant developments within the company, including the appointment of a new CEO, internalization of functions, and changes to the board of directors.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSignificant Developments\nOn January 1, 2020, Joel T. Murphy became Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Murphy will continue as a member of the board, where he has served since May 2019. Mr. Murphy was the CEO of our New Market Properties subsidiary for the last five years until his appointment as our CEO. Mr. Murphy succeeded our previous CEO and Chairman of the Board, Daniel M. DuPree, who has remained with us as Executive Chairman of the Board.\nOn January 31, 2020, we internalized the functions performed by Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Manager\") and NMP Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Sub-Manager\") by acquiring the entities that owned the Former Manager and the Former Sub-Manager (such transactions, collectively, the \"Internalization\") for an aggregate purchase price of $154.0 million, plus up to $25.0 million of additional consideration. Additionally, up to $15.0 million of the $154.0 million purchase price was to be held back and is payable to the sellers less certain losses following final resolution of certain specified matters. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 31, 2020 the sellers sold all of the outstanding shares of NELL Partners, Inc. ( NELL\u201d) and NMA Holdings, Inc. (\"NMA\"), parent companies of the Former Manager and Former Sub-Manager, respectively, to us, in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $111.1 million in cash paid at the closing which reflects the satisfaction of certain indebtedness of NELL, the estimated net working capital adjustment, and a hold back of $15.0 million for certain specified matters. Trusts established, or entities owned, by the family of John A. Williams, the Company's former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel M. DuPree, the Company's Executive Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Leonard A. Silverstein, the Company's former Vice Chairman of the Board, and former President and Chief Operating Officer, were the owners of NELL. Trusts established, or entities owned, by Joel T.

Gresham, Jr., Leonard A. Silverstein, and John M. Wiens did not stand for re-election as members of our Board of Directors and John M. Cannon was elected as a member of our Board of Directors until our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, if and when a successor is elected and qualified.\nOn November 3, 2020 we sold all eight of our student housing communities and one real estate loan investment to an unrelated third party. This transaction represented our exit from the student housing sector.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired four multifamily communities and two grocery-anchored shopping centers. We also sold one multifamily community and contributed one grocery-anchored shopping center to a joint venture in exchange for cash and a 50% interest in the joint venture.\nOn November 19, 2020, we announced an approval by our common stockholders of a reduction of our call option on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock from 10 years to 5 years.\nOn November 24, 2020, we called and redeemed 208,786 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which was approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock that was available to be redeemed at our option. Holders of another approximate 149,938 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock were redeemed by the holders during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 144,645 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $130.2 million and we issued 18,845 shares of Series M1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $18.3 million.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndustry Outlook\nIn spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe continued, albeit sporadic, improvement in the United States' economy will take hold for 2021, with continued improvement in the job market from pandemic lows and growth and improvements in the overall economy. As the country combats the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccine rollouts and other measures, it should be the case that the impact from the pandemic lessens and the economy can begin a path to normalcy. The new presidential administration reduces some uncertainty in the direction and trajectory of economic growth and increases the probability of a larger stimulus package being enacted, which should also energize the economy and speed economic recovery. We believe a recovering economy, improving job market and increased consumer confidence should help create favorable conditions in the recovery for the multifamily sector, grocery-anchored shopping centers and class A office demand.\nMultifamily Communities\nThe Company continues to believe in the health of the multifamily industry, which is driven by both favorable demographic tailwinds and strong economic fundamentals.\nTwo of the nation's largest generational cohorts - an estimated 72 million Millennials and 72 million Baby Boomers - continue to create demand for multifamily housing. Lifestyle trends within these groups support the multifamily thesis, with Millennials seeking flexibility and Baby Boomers looking to downsize and reduce ongoing maintenance required with home ownership. These trends are further amplified within the Company's footprint and strategy: operating newly-constructed Class A communities in growing sunbelt suburban markets. The sunbelt continues to benefit from in-migration trends as weather, affordability and friendly business environments attract households and corporations alike. Millennials, who on average are forming households and starting families later than prior generations, are now searching for additional square footage, relative affordability and good schools; attributes that are generally more prevalent in the suburbs.\nFundamentally, the multifamily industry is benefiting from the current housing shortage in the United States, which Freddie Mac estimates at 2.5 million housing units. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. is in the early stages of an economic expansion, which we believe would drive job growth, and lead to increased multifamily demand. The sector continues to show resiliency and positive momentum as forecasts generally support stable occupancy, rent growth and net absorption of units.\nInvestors, both domestic and abroad, continue to seek quality multifamily housing given strong secular demand and the financial stability of the industry. Commercial real estate investment volume remains high with multifamily realizing more volume than any other property type; a trend that has been ongoing and is expected to continue. Moreover, mortgage production remains very healthy and efficient as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, life insurance companies and collateralized mortgage-backed securities lenders compete for borrowers as they see increased demand for multifamily debt, whether for their own account or securitized.\nStrategically, the Company is focused on the goal of outperforming the multifamily market on a risk adjusted basis, as it looks for investments that offer an attractive location, superior product or provide a value proposition. Moreover, the Company is purposeful in its management of assets, aiming to provide a relatively stable and steady rental stream from its portfolio by employing principally fixed-rate long-term project-level debt financing and adhering to strict leasing guidelines regarding the credit worthiness of its tenants.\nNew Market Properties\nWe specialize in owning and operating shopping centers anchored by market-leading grocers complemented by convenience-based retailers across high growth suburban Sunbelt markets. These centers are primarily anchored by Publix, Kroger, Harris Teeter and other market share leading grocers with high sales per square foot. The merchandising mix of our portfolio is focused on e-commerce resiliency and has proven its stability and strength during the COVID-19 pandemic. The retailers who have been successful have embraced the coexistence of their bricks and mortars with a parallel and complimentary e-commerce business. Retailers are focused on optimizing in store pickup programs, while also using their existing bricks and mortar locations as fulfillment centers for these e-commerce businesses.\nOur neighborhood driven and convenience focused shopping centers proved to be more important to their communities than ever during 2020. Kroger reported sales increases of 10.9% for the period ending November 7, 2020. Ahold Delhaize (Giant/Food Lion) reported fourth quarter 2020 same store sales increases of 11.2% and a 15.6% year-over-year increase on annual 2020 sales and we anticipate Publix increases to be comparable when they report. Retailers have recognized the benefits of being located in shopping centers anchored by heavily trafficked grocers which is evidenced in our pace of leasing towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. The company continued its solid performance in the 4th quarter, collecting approximately 97% of recurring rent charges, unadjusted for deferrals, up from collections of 92% and 96% in second and third quarters, respectively. Approximately 54% of our annual base rent comes from essential tenants who remained open throughout the pandemic and approximately 34% of our annual base rent comes from our grocery and pharmacy partners, who are closing out a very strong year of sales in 2020.\nIndicative of the continuing recovery from the pandemic, the pace of deferral requests has slowed significantly. As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $1.9 million of retail recurring rental revenue, or approximately 2.7% cumulatively during the pandemic's three quarters. Rent deferrals have included lease amendments that add additional term and/or eliminate cumbersome operational restrictions on the center. We believe these amendments will ultimately result in unlocking additional long-term value across the portfolio. We attribute our strong operational performance throughout the pandemic to our essential and convenience-based tenant mix collaborating creatively and efficiently with our asset management, leasing and property\nmanagement teams to find optimal solutions for all parties involved. We are confident in our portfolio's tenant make up, focused on market leading grocers complemented by necessity and convenience-based tenants.\nCOVID-19 accelerated the migration out of the Northeast and California and into the high growth Sunbelt markets that the company has invested in. According to a report by Clarion, population growth in the Sunbelt is expected to accelerate by another 19 million (13%), while non-Sunbelt states are forecasted to rise by only 3 million, or 2%, over the next decade. The amount of job growth and population growth taking place in the Sunbelt is encouraging and is tied to companies and employees seeking better climate and lower cost of living. Further, employers are helping facilitate the growth as they flock to the Sunbelt for the more business friendly environments and lower costs of doing business. Many retailers are taking note of the increasing migration of their consumers to the Sunbelt and are focused on increasing their bricks and mortar presence throughout the region.\nThe retail bankruptcies that have taken place over the last 12-24 months were primarily centered in business concepts predicted by many to be on the verge of failing prior to the pandemic. On a forward-looking basis, the company is monitoring the market and anticipates that there could be additional bankruptcies that occur. We actively track our Watch List\u201d tenants based on market knowledge and tenant conversations. This list is used to help proactively evaluate strategic alternatives for tenants at risk. The company currently has minimal exposure to our Watch List, with under 3% of our New Market Properties segment's annual base rent attributed to such tenants.\nPreferred Office Properties\nPreferred Office Properties operates a 3.2 million square foot portfolio of Class A office assets in markets across the Sunbelt. While new leasing activity has slowed and sublease availability has increased in most markets due to uncertainty from COVID-19, and we expect to see some level of continued soft demand in the near-term; the Company's office investments are 95% leased with only approximately 12% of the portfolio leases expiring through the end of 2022. Furthermore, multi-year contractual leases and rent schedules paired with high quality tenant balance sheets have offered protection against adverse impacts of COVID-19, and office-using employment has fared better to date in the pandemic than have hourly wage earners.\nDespite the ongoing adverse effect of the pandemic, we continue to hold a positive long-term outlook for the office industry in our targeted markets. We are optimistic that the distribution of vaccines creates the opportunity for business to begin to return to more normal activity over the course of 2021. While we think the prevalence of work from home will continue in some capacity, we expect the physical office to remain the center of the business workplace. According to a recent survey conducted by PwC, 87% of executives believe the office is critical for collaborating with team members and building relationships.\nIn addition, the pandemic has accelerated a number of trends that were already serving as tailwinds for our target markets, especially the demographic shifts from larger, more expensive gateway cities like New York and San Francisco to the suburban, Sunbelt markets. According to a 2018 report by Moody's Analytics, for 2008 - 2018 the Sunbelt population grew 3 times faster than non-Sunbelt states. Moody's projects that for 2019 - 2030 that outpacing will accelerate to nearly 7 times non-Sunbelt states. And the latest U.S. Census estimates show that Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia were among the top five states in the nation in terms of nominal population gains in 2020. As a result, we are seeing significant interest from small and large companies looking to relocate and/or expand their office footprint in our Sunbelt markets because of the deep talent pool, low cost of living and doing business, and comparatively low density. As we believe these trends will continue, we remain optimistic about the Sunbelt office markets that are in the path of long-term growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical. We consider these policies critical because they involve the application of significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nReal Estate\nCost Capitalization. Investments in real estate properties are carried at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building and land improvements and 5 to 10 years for computers, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred for transactions that are deemed to be business combinations. Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 (\"ASU 2017-01\"), which was released in January 2017, clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 and believe our future acquisitions of multifamily communities, office buildings, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and student housing communities will generally qualify as asset acquisitions. Pursuant to ASU 2017-01, certain qualifying acquisition costs will be capitalized and amortized rather than expensed as incurred.\nRepairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the items' estimated useful lives. Repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate property. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.\nReal Estate Acquisition Valuation. Following our adoption of ASU 2017-01, we generally record the acquisitions of income-producing real estate as asset acquisitions.\nAll assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values.\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining average non-cancelable term of the leases. We amortize any recorded above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase, respectively, to rental income over the remaining average non-cancelable term of the respective leases. The capitalized above-market leases and in place leases are included in the acquired intangible assets line of the consolidated balance sheets. Both above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases for office properties. The amortization period for retail shopping center leases is the remaining lease term plus any below market probable renewal options.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. These estimates include estimated carrying costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods.\nThe fair values of in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties represent the value of direct costs associated with leasing, including opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring in-place leases. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, legal and marketing costs, incentives such as tenant improvement allowances and other direct costs. Such direct costs are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is estimated using the estimated market lease rates and the estimated absorption period of the space. These direct costs and opportunity costs are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as acquired intangible assets and are amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair values of above-market and below-market in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases, taking into consideration the probability of renewals for any below-market leases. Acquired in-place lease values for multifamily communities and student housing communities are amortized to operating expense over the average remaining non-cancelable term of the respective in-place leases.\nEstimating the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, the number of years the property will be held for investment and market interest\nrates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact their subsequent amortization and ultimately our net income.\nImpairment of Real Estate and Related Intangible Assets. We monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable or realized. When conditions suggest that an asset group may be impaired, we compare its carrying value to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including proceeds from its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of an asset group, we record an impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group. Fair market value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to use future estimates of net operating income, expected hold period, capitalization rates and discount rates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of the assets which could impact the amount of our net income and our assets on our balance sheet.\nReal Estate Loans\nWe extend loans for purposes such as to to acquire land and to provide partial financing for the development of multifamily residential communities, student housing communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties and for other real estate or real estate related projects. Certain of these loans we extend include characteristics such as exclusive options to purchase the project within a specific time window following expected project completion and stabilization. These characteristics can cause the loans to contain variable interests and the potential of consolidation of the underlying project as a variable interest entity, or VIE. We consider the facts and circumstances pertinent to each loan, including the relative amount of financing we are contributing to the overall project cost, decision making rights or control we hold and our rights to expected residual gains or our obligations to absorb expected residual losses from the project. If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE due to holding a controlling financial interest, the majority of decision making control, or by other means, consolidation of the VIE would be required. Arriving at these conclusions requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially with regard to our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. Additionally, we analyze each loan arrangement and utilize these same assumptions and judgments for consideration of whether the loan qualifies for accounting as a loan or as an investment in a real estate development project.\nExpected Credit Losses\nThe Company carries its investments in real estate loans at amortized cost that consists of drawn amounts on the loans, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and current expected credit losses.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, that replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost, and requires entities to record credit allowances for total expected future losses on financial assets at the outset of each loan. For each loan in which the Company is the lender, the amount of protection afforded to the Company is estimated to be the excess of the future estimated fair market value of the developed property over the developer's related obligations (including the Company's mezzanine or member loan(s)), other loans senior to the Company's, the expected future balance of accrued interest and any other obligations related to the project's funding. Arriving at the future estimated fair market value of the developed property requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially regarding our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. The excess represents the amount of equity dollars in each real estate project plus profit expected to be realized by the developer on the project, both of which are in a subordinate position to the Company's real estate loan investments. This numeric result is expressed as a percentage of the developed property's future estimated fair market value (a \"percentage of protection\"), which is then pooled into ranges of loss percentages that was derived from company-specific loss experience to determine the expected credit loss for the loan ( the indicated loss reserve ratio\u201d). The product of this indicated loss reserve ratio and the expected fully-funded balance (inclusive of an expected future balance of accrued interest) is the initial total expected credit loss reserve. Over the life of the loan, the initial reserve is reevaluated for potential reduction at the achievement of certain milestones in construction and lease-up progress as the project approaches completion and the loan approaches maturity, given no unforeseen degradation in project performance or failure to adhere to the terms of the loan by the borrower/developer. Finally, the loss reserve may be further refined by the Company due to any subjective qualitative factors deemed pertinent and worthy of reflection.\nThe Company implemented this new guidance by applying this model to its existing portfolio of real estate loan investments", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSignificant Developments\nOn January 1, 2020, Joel T. Murphy became Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Murphy will continue as a member of the board, where he has served since May 2019. Mr. Murphy was the CEO of our New Market Properties subsidiary for the last five years until his appointment as our CEO. Mr. Murphy succeeded our previous CEO and Chairman of the Board, Daniel M. DuPree, who has remained with us as Executive Chairman of the Board.\nOn January 31, 2020, we internalized the functions performed by Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Manager\") and NMP Advisors, LLC (the \"Former Sub-Manager\") by acquiring the entities that owned the Former Manager and the Former Sub-Manager (such transactions, collectively, the \"Internalization\") for an aggregate purchase price of $154.0 million, plus up to $25.0 million of additional consideration. Additionally, up to $15.0 million of the $154.0 million purchase price was to be held back and is payable to the sellers less certain losses following final resolution of certain specified matters. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 31, 2020 the sellers sold all of the outstanding shares of NELL Partners, Inc. ( NELL\u201d) and NMA Holdings, Inc. (\"NMA\"), parent companies of the Former Manager and Former Sub-Manager, respectively, to us, in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $111.1 million in cash paid at the closing which reflects the satisfaction of certain indebtedness of NELL, the estimated net working capital adjustment, and a hold back of $15.0 million for certain specified matters. Trusts established, or entities owned, by the family of John A. Williams, the Company's former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel M. DuPree, the Company's Executive Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Leonard A. Silverstein, the Company's former Vice Chairman of the Board, and former President and Chief Operating Officer, were the owners of NELL. Trusts established, or entities owned, by Joel T. Murphy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, the family of Mr. Williams, Mr. DuPree and Mr. Silverstein were the owners of the Former Sub-Manager.\nAt our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, William J. Gresham, Jr., Leonard A. Silverstein, and John M. Wiens did not stand for re-election as members of our Board of Directors and John M. Cannon was elected as a member of our Board of Directors until our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, if and when a successor is elected and qualified.\nOn November 3, 2020 we sold all eight of our student housing communities and one real estate loan investment to an unrelated third party. This transaction represented our exit from the student housing sector.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired four multifamily communities and two grocery-anchored shopping centers. We also sold one multifamily community and contributed one grocery-anchored shopping center to a joint venture in exchange for cash and a 50% interest in the joint venture.\nOn November 19, 2020, we announced an approval by our common stockholders of a reduction of our call option on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock from 10 years to 5 years.\nOn November 24, 2020, we called and redeemed 208,786 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which was approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock that was available to be redeemed at our option. Holders of another approximate 149,938 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock were redeemed by the holders during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 144,645 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $130.2 million and we issued 18,845 shares of Series M1 Preferred Stock and collected net proceeds of approximately $18.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 65,298 Units (one share of Series A Preferred Stock and one warrant to purchase 20 shares of our Common Stock) and collected net proceeds of approximately $58.8 million from our $1.5 Billion Unit Offering. We issued no mShares during 2020. Our Preferred Stock offerings and our other equity offerings are discussed in detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued approximately 617,000 shares of Common Stock under our ATM Program.\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"expects,\" \"assumes,\" \"goals,\" \"guidance,\" \"trends\" and similar expressions, constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndustry Outlook\nIn spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe continued, albeit sporadic, improvement in the United States' economy will take hold for 2021, with continued improvement in the job market from pandemic lows and growth and improvements in the overall economy. As the country combats the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccine rollouts and other measures, it should be the case that the impact from the pandemic lessens and the economy can begin a path to normalcy. The new presidential administration reduces some uncertainty in the direction and trajectory of economic growth and increases the probability of a larger stimulus package being enacted, which should also energize the economy and speed economic recovery. We believe a recovering economy, improving job market and increased consumer confidence should help create favorable conditions in the recovery for the multifamily sector, grocery-anchored shopping centers and class A office demand.\nMultifamily Communities\nThe Company continues to believe in the health of the multifamily industry, which is driven by both favorable demographic tailwinds and strong economic fundamentals.\nTwo of the nation's largest generational cohorts - an estimated 72 million Millennials and 72 million Baby Boomers - continue to create demand for multifamily housing. Lifestyle trends within these groups support the multifamily thesis, with Millennials seeking flexibility and Baby Boomers looking to downsize and reduce ongoing maintenance required with home ownership. These trends are further amplified within the Company's footprint and strategy: operating newly-constructed Class A communities in growing sunbelt suburban markets. The sunbelt continues to benefit from in-migration trends as weather, affordability and friendly business environments attract households and corporations alike. Millennials, who on average are forming households and starting families later than prior generations, are now searching for additional square footage, relative affordability and good schools; attributes that are generally more prevalent in the suburbs.\nFundamentally, the multifamily industry is benefiting from the current housing shortage in the United States, which Freddie Mac estimates at 2.5 million housing units. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. is in the early stages of an economic expansion, which we believe would drive job growth, and lead to increased multifamily demand. The sector continues to show resiliency and positive momentum as forecasts generally support stable occupancy, rent growth and net absorption of units.\nInvestors, both domestic and abroad, continue to seek quality multifamily housing given strong secular demand and the financial stability of the industry. Commercial real estate investment volume remains high with multifamily realizing more volume than any other property type; a trend that has been ongoing and is expected to continue. Moreover, mortgage production remains very healthy and efficient as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, life insurance companies and collateralized mortgage-backed securities lenders compete for borrowers as they see increased demand for multifamily debt, whether for their own account or securitized.\nStrategically, the Company is focused on the goal of outperforming the multifamily market on a risk adjusted basis, as it looks for investments that offer an attractive location, superior product or provide a value proposition. Moreover, the Company is purposeful in its management of assets, aiming to provide a relatively stable and steady rental stream from its portfolio by employing principally fixed-rate long-term project-level debt financing and adhering to strict leasing guidelines regarding the credit worthiness of its tenants.\nNew Market Properties\nWe specialize in owning and operating shopping centers anchored by market-leading grocers complemented by convenience-based retailers across high growth suburban Sunbelt markets. These centers are primarily anchored by Publix, Kroger, Harris Teeter and other market share leading grocers with high sales per square foot. The merchandising mix of our portfolio is focused on e-commerce resiliency and has proven its stability and strength during the COVID-19 pandemic. The retailers who have been successful have embraced the coexistence of their bricks and mortars with a parallel and complimentary e-commerce business. Retailers are focused on optimizing in store pickup programs, while also using their existing bricks and mortar locations as fulfillment centers for these e-commerce businesses.\nOur neighborhood driven and convenience focused shopping centers proved to be more important to their communities than ever during 2020. Kroger reported sales increases of 10.9% for the period ending November 7, 2020. Ahold Delhaize (Giant/Food Lion) reported fourth quarter 2020 same store sales increases of 11.2% and a 15.6% year-over-year increase on annual 2020 sales and we anticipate Publix increases to be comparable when they report. Retailers have recognized the benefits of being located in shopping centers anchored by heavily trafficked grocers which is evidenced in our pace of leasing towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. The company continued its solid performance in the 4th quarter, collecting approximately 97% of recurring rent charges, unadjusted for deferrals, up from collections of 92% and 96% in second and third quarters, respectively. Approximately 54% of our annual base rent comes from essential tenants who remained open throughout the pandemic and approximately 34% of our annual base rent comes from our grocery and pharmacy partners, who are closing out a very strong year of sales in 2020.\nIndicative of the continuing recovery from the pandemic, the pace of deferral requests has slowed significantly. As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $1.9 million of retail recurring rental revenue, or approximately 2.7% cumulatively during the pandemic's three quarters. Rent deferrals have included lease amendments that add additional term and/or eliminate cumbersome operational restrictions on the center. We believe these amendments will ultimately result in unlocking additional long-term value across the portfolio. We attribute our strong operational performance throughout the pandemic to our essential and convenience-based tenant mix collaborating creatively and efficiently with our asset management, leasing and property\nmanagement teams to find optimal solutions for all parties involved. We are confident in our portfolio's tenant make up, focused on market leading grocers complemented by necessity and convenience-based tenants.\nCOVID-19 accelerated the migration out of the Northeast and California and into the high growth Sunbelt markets that the company has invested in. According to a report by Clarion, population growth in the Sunbelt is expected to accelerate by another 19 million (13%), while non-Sunbelt states are forecasted to rise by only 3 million, or 2%, over the next decade. The amount of job growth and population growth taking place in the Sunbelt is encouraging and is tied to companies and employees seeking better climate and lower cost of living. Further, employers are helping facilitate the growth as they flock to the Sunbelt for the more business friendly environments and lower costs of doing business. Many retailers are taking note of the increasing migration of their consumers to the Sunbelt and are focused on increasing their bricks and mortar presence throughout the region.\nThe retail bankruptcies that have taken place over the last 12-24 months were primarily centered in business concepts predicted by many to be on the verge of failing prior to the pandemic. On a forward-looking basis, the company is monitoring the market and anticipates that there could be additional bankruptcies that occur. We actively track our Watch List\u201d tenants based on market knowledge and tenant conversations. This list is used to help proactively evaluate strategic alternatives for tenants at risk. The company currently has minimal exposure to our Watch List, with under 3% of our New Market Properties segment's annual base rent attributed to such tenants.\nPreferred Office Properties\nPreferred Office Properties operates a 3.2 million square foot portfolio of Class A office assets in markets across the Sunbelt. While new leasing activity has slowed and sublease availability has increased in most markets due to uncertainty from COVID-19, and we expect to see some level of continued soft demand in the near-term; the Company's office investments are 95% leased with only approximately 12% of the portfolio leases expiring through the end of 2022. Furthermore, multi-year contractual leases and rent schedules paired with high quality tenant balance sheets have offered protection against adverse impacts of COVID-19, and office-using employment has fared better to date in the pandemic than have hourly wage earners.\nDespite the ongoing adverse effect of the pandemic, we continue to hold a positive long-term outlook for the office industry in our targeted markets. We are optimistic that the distribution of vaccines creates the opportunity for business to begin to return to more normal activity over the course of 2021. While we think the prevalence of work from home will continue in some capacity, we expect the physical office to remain the center of the business workplace. According to a recent survey conducted by PwC, 87% of executives believe the office is critical for collaborating with team members and building relationships.\nIn addition, the pandemic has accelerated a number of trends that were already serving as tailwinds for our target markets, especially the demographic shifts from larger, more expensive gateway cities like New York and San Francisco to the suburban, Sunbelt markets. According to a 2018 report by Moody's Analytics, for 2008 - 2018 the Sunbelt population grew 3 times faster than non-Sunbelt states. Moody's projects that for 2019 - 2030 that outpacing will accelerate to nearly 7 times non-Sunbelt states. And the latest U.S. Census estimates show that Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia were among the top five states in the nation in terms of nominal population gains in 2020. As a result, we are seeing significant interest from small and large companies looking to relocate and/or expand their office footprint in our Sunbelt markets because of the deep talent pool, low cost of living and doing business, and comparatively low density. As we believe these trends will continue, we remain optimistic about the Sunbelt office markets that are in the path of long-term growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical. We consider these policies critical because they involve the application of significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nReal Estate\nCost Capitalization. Investments in real estate properties are carried at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building and land improvements and 5 to 10 years for computers, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred for transactions that are deemed to be business combinations. Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 (\"ASU 2017-01\"), which was released in January 2017, clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 and believe our future acquisitions of multifamily communities, office buildings, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and student housing communities will generally qualify as asset acquisitions. Pursuant to ASU 2017-01, certain qualifying acquisition costs will be capitalized and amortized rather than expensed as incurred.\nRepairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the items' estimated useful lives. Repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate property. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.\nReal Estate Acquisition Valuation. Following our adoption of ASU 2017-01, we generally record the acquisitions of income-producing real estate as asset acquisitions.\nAll assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values.\nWe assess the acquisition-date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining average non-cancelable term of the leases. We amortize any recorded above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase, respectively, to rental income over the remaining average non-cancelable term of the respective leases. The capitalized above-market leases and in place leases are included in the acquired intangible assets line of the consolidated balance sheets. Both above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases for office properties. The amortization period for retail shopping center leases is the remaining lease term plus any below market probable renewal options.\nIntangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. These estimates include estimated carrying costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods.\nThe fair values of in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties represent the value of direct costs associated with leasing, including opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring in-place leases. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, legal and marketing costs, incentives such as tenant improvement allowances and other direct costs. Such direct costs are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. The value of opportunity costs is estimated using the estimated market lease rates and the estimated absorption period of the space. These direct costs and opportunity costs are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as acquired intangible assets and are amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The fair values of above-market and below-market in-place leases for retail shopping centers and office properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases, taking into consideration the probability of renewals for any below-market leases. Acquired in-place lease values for multifamily communities and student housing communities are amortized to operating expense over the average remaining non-cancelable term of the respective in-place leases.\nEstimating the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, the number of years the property will be held for investment and market interest\nrates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact their subsequent amortization and ultimately our net income.\nImpairment of Real Estate and Related Intangible Assets. We monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable or realized. When conditions suggest that an asset group may be impaired, we compare its carrying value to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including proceeds from its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of an asset group, we record an impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group. Fair market value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to use future estimates of net operating income, expected hold period, capitalization rates and discount rates. The use of different assumptions would result in variations of the values of the assets which could impact the amount of our net income and our assets on our balance sheet.\nReal Estate Loans\nWe extend loans for purposes such as to to acquire land and to provide partial financing for the development of multifamily residential communities, student housing communities, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties and for other real estate or real estate related projects. Certain of these loans we extend include characteristics such as exclusive options to purchase the project within a specific time window following expected project completion and stabilization. These characteristics can cause the loans to contain variable interests and the potential of consolidation of the underlying project as a variable interest entity, or VIE. We consider the facts and circumstances pertinent to each loan, including the relative amount of financing we are contributing to the overall project cost, decision making rights or control we hold and our rights to expected residual gains or our obligations to absorb expected residual losses from the project. If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE due to holding a controlling financial interest, the majority of decision making control, or by other means, consolidation of the VIE would be required. Arriving at these conclusions requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially with regard to our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. Additionally, we analyze each loan arrangement and utilize these same assumptions and judgments for consideration of whether the loan qualifies for accounting as a loan or as an investment in a real estate development project.\nExpected Credit Losses\nThe Company carries its investments in real estate loans at amortized cost that consists of drawn amounts on the loans, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and current expected credit losses.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, that replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost, and requires entities to record credit allowances for total expected future losses on financial assets at the outset of each loan. For each loan in which the Company is the lender, the amount of protection afforded to the Company is estimated to be the excess of the future estimated fair market value of the developed property over the developer's related obligations (including the Company's mezzanine or member loan(s)), other loans senior to the Company's, the expected future balance of accrued interest and any other obligations related to the project's funding. Arriving at the future estimated fair market value of the developed property requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments concerning each project, especially regarding our estimates of future market capitalization rates and property net operating income projections. The excess represents the amount of equity dollars in each real estate project plus profit expected to be realized by the developer on the project, both of which are in a subordinate position to the Company's real estate loan investments. This numeric result is expressed as a percentage of the developed property's future estimated fair market value (a \"percentage of protection\"), which is then pooled into ranges of loss percentages that was derived from company-specific loss experience to determine the expected credit loss for the loan ( the indicated loss reserve ratio\u201d). The product of this indicated loss reserve ratio and the expected fully-funded balance (inclusive of an expected future balance of accrued interest) is the initial total expected credit loss reserve. Over the life of the loan, the initial reserve is reevaluated for potential reduction at the achievement of certain milestones in construction and lease-up progress as the project approaches completion and the loan approaches maturity, given no unforeseen degradation in project performance or failure to adhere to the terms of the loan by the borrower/developer. Finally, the loss reserve may be further refined by the Company due to any subjective qualitative factors deemed pertinent and worthy of reflection.\nThe Company implemented this new guidance by applying this model to its existing portfolio of real estate loan investments"}
