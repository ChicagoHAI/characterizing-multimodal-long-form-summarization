MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin. We have developed an oil, natural gas and NGL asset base of proved reserves, as well as a portfolio of development drilling opportunities on high resource-potential leasehold on contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin. We are focused on growing our proved reserves and production primarily through the development of our large inventory of identified liquids-rich horizontal drilling locations.\nOur Properties\nWe have assembled, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 109,400 net acres of large, contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin as indicated by the results of our horizontal drilling program and the results of offset operators. Additionally, we hold approximately 113,700 net acres outside of what we consider our Core DJ Basin, which we refer to as our Other Rockies Area,\u201d that we believe is prospective for many of the same formations as our properties in the Core DJ Basin. We operated 96% of our horizontal production for the year ended December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 238.1 MMBoe, of which approximately 20% were classified as proved developed reserves. For more information about our properties, please read Business-Our Properties.\u201d\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, coupled with the impact of settled derivatives, increased to $306.7 million as compared to $255.4 million in the same prior year period due to an increase in sales volumes of 3,856.0 MBoe, offset primarily by a decline of $8.02 in realized price per BOE, including settled derivatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $456.0 million as compared to net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss was driven by non-cash compensation expense of $200.3 million primarily related to the IPO and a net loss on commodity derivatives of $100.9 million, primarily due to the increase in NYMEX crude oil futures prices as December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 and change in fair value from the execution of new positions.\nAdjusted EBITDAX was $192.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $176.1 million in the same period in 2015, reflecting a 9% increase. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Adjusted EBITDAX.\u201d\nOperational Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we continued to focus on growing production while at the same time implementing operational efficiencies to reduce drilling and completion costs. We drilled 103 gross (89.8 net) horizontal wells and completed 72 gross (54.9 net) horizontal wells in the DJ Basin. As of January 2017, we are currently running a full time three-rig program and plan to use a fourth rig on a spot basis to fill in gaps in the drilling program.\nRecent Developments\nRecent Acquisitions\nNovember 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 22, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interest in approximately 9,200 net acres of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin for approximately $120.0 million, including customary closing adjustments. We also made an additional $41.1 million deposit in November 2016 in conjunction with November 2016 Acquisition, which has been reflected in the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet within the cash held in escrow line item. The deposit was made for two additional closings of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin. The first closing occurred in January 2017 and added approximately 5,300 net acres. The second closing is expected to occur in the first half of 2017 and will add approximately 800 net acres.\nOctober 2016 Acquisition\nOn October 3, 2016, we acquired additional oil and gas properties primarily located in the Wattenberg Field for total consideration of $405.3 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (the Bayswater Acquisition\u201d or October 2016 Acquisition\u201d). Upon completion of the Bayswater Acquisition, we acquired producing and non-producing assets primarily located in the central and northwest portions of the Wattenberg Field from an existing working interest partner, primarily around our existing Greeley and Windsor areas. The Bayswater Acquisition consisted of working interest in approximately 6,400 net acres and 31 gross (19 net) drilled but uncompleted wells, as of the date of acquisition. The Bayswater acquisition provided net daily production of approximately 6,900 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2016. We funded the purchase price through the issuance of $260.3 million in convertible preferred securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOption to Acquire Additional Assets from October 2016 Acquisition\nIn connection with the consummation of the Bayswater Acquisition, we paid $10.0 million for an option to purchase additional assets from Bayswater for an additional $190.0 million, for a total purchase price of $200.0 million (the Additional Bayswater Assets\u201d). The option allowed us to exercise at any time until March 31, 2017. If we were to not exercise our option to acquire the Additional Bayswater Assets, Bayswater would have the right until April 30, 2017 to elect to sell those assets to us for an additional $120.0 million, for a total purchase price for the Additional Bayswater Assets of $130.0 million. In March 2017, we entered into an amendment to this agreement with Bayswater to terminate both our and Bayswater's options for no further consideration. The $10.0 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2016 to other operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations.\nAugust 2016 Acquisition\nOn August 23, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interests in approximately 1,100 net acres of leasehold located the Core DJ Basin for approximately $13.7 million in cash. The effective date for the acquisition was August 31, 2016, with purchase price adjustments calculated as of the closing date on August 23, 2016. We expect to close on approximately 300 additional net acres related to this acquisition in the first half of 2017 for an additional $3.4 million.\nCapital Raises and Corporate Reorganization\nPrivate Placement of Common Stock\nOn December 15, 2016, we issued approximately 25.0 million shares of common stock, at a price of $18.25 per share, in a private placement of our common stock (the Private Placement\u201d). The Private Placement resulted in approximately $457.0 million of gross proceeds and approximately $441.9 million of net proceeds (after deducting placement agent commission and offering expenses). The offering of the common stock issued in connection with the Private Placement was registered in a Form S-1, filed on January 9, 2017. Proceeds from the Private Placement are going to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the Company's 2017 capital expenditures.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn October 17, 2016, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of approximately 33.3 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share and we became a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) under the ticker symbol XOG\u201d. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, we received approximately $681.0 million of aggregate net proceeds from our IPO after the underwriters exercised their option on October 24, 2016 to purchase 5.0 million additional shares in full. We used (i) $90.0 million of the net proceeds from the Offering to redeem in full the Series A Preferred Units (as defined below) and (ii) $291.6 million to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fund our 2017 capital expenditures.\nCorporate Reorganization\nExtraction Oil & Gas, Inc., formerly known as Extraction Oil & Gas, LLC, was converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation, on October 12, 2016. In connection with the IPO on October 17, 2016, Extraction Oil & Gas Holdings, LLC ( Holdings\u201d) was merged with and into Extraction, and Extraction was the surviving entity to the merger (the Corporate Reorganization\u201d). All equity holders in Holdings, other than the holders of the Series B Preferred Units (which were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of Series A Preferred Stock), but including the holders of restricted units and incentive units, received approximately 108.5 million shares of our common stock, with the allocation of such shares among our existing equity holders determined, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of Holdings, by reference to an implied valuation based on the 10-day volume weighted average price of Extraction's common stock following the closing of the IPO. The merger was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. As part of Holdings' merger with and into Extraction, all of Holdings' other subsidiaries became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Extraction.\nConvertible Preferred Securities\nWe previously issued to affiliates of Apollo Capital Management ( Apollo\u201d) $75.0 million in Series A Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series A Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we used $90.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem the Series A Preferred Units in full, which included a premium of $15.0 million.\nIn addition, we have issued to, among others, investment funds affiliated with OZ Management LP and Yorktown Partners LLC ( Yorktown\u201d) $185.3 million in Series B Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series B Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we had the ability to pay up to 50% of the quarterly dividend in kind. The Series B Preferred Units were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that are entitled to receive a cash dividend of 5.875% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we have the ability to pay such quarterly dividends in kind at a dividend rate of 10% per year (decreased proportionately to the extent such quarterly dividends are partially paid in cash). Beginning on or after the later of (a) 90 days after the closing of the IPO and (b) the earlier of 120 days after the closing of the IPO and the expiration of the lock-up period contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the IPO (the \"Lock-Up Period End Date\"), the Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the election of the Series A Preferred Holders at a conversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195. Beginning on or after the Lock-Up Period End Date until the three year anniversary of the closing of the IPO, we may elect to convert the Series A Preferred Stock at a\nconversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195, but only if the closing price of our common stock trades at or above a certain premium to our initial offering price, such premium to decrease with time. In certain situations, including a change of control, the Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 135% of the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) a 17.5% annualized internal rate of return on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock mature on October 15, 2021, at which time they are mandatorily redeemable for cash at the liquidation preference.\nAmendment to Revolving Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2016, the borrowing base of our revolving credit facility was increased from $450.0 million to $475.0 million. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Revolving Credit Facility.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nIn connection with the IPO, Holdings was merged into the Company. Prior to this corporate reorganization, we were not subject to federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to us prior to such corporate reorganization contain no provision for federal or state income taxes because the tax liability with respect to Holdings' taxable income was passed through to our members. Beginning October 12, 2016, we began to be taxed as a C corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and subject to federal and state income taxes at a blended statutory rate of approximately 38% of pretax earnings.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and gas operations, including:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSources of revenue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales volumes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRealized prices on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL, including the effect of our commodity derivative contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLease operating expenses ( LOE\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDAX (a Non-GAAP measure).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Our Revenues\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of NGL that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. Our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenues were derived 81% from oil sales, 10% from natural gas sales and 9% from NGL sales. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenues were derived 79% from oil sales, 13% from natural gas sales and 8% from NGL sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues were derived 70% from oil sales, 17% from natural gas sales and 13% from NGL sales. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nSales Volumes\nThe following table presents historical sales volumes for our properties for the periods indicated:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOil (MBbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,287 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,946 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,022 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNatural gas (MMcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,212 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,823 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,664 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNGL (MBbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,284 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,335 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (MBoe)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,940 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,084 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,792 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage net sales (BOE/d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,891 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,408 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,908 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs reservoir pressures decline, production from a given well or formation decreases. Growth in our future production and reserves will depend on our ability to continue to add proved reserves in excess of our production. Accordingly, we plan to maintain our focus on adding reserves through organic growth as well as acquisitions. Our ability to add reserves through development projects and acquisitions is dependent on many factors, including takeaway capacity in our areas of operation and our ability to raise capital, obtain regulatory approvals, procure contract drilling rigs and personnel and successfully identify and consummate acquisitions. Please read Risks Related to the Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Industry and Our Business\u201d in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for a further description of the risks that affect us.\nRealized Prices on the Sale of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL\nOur results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to market our production effectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu during the same period. Declines in, and continued depression of, the price of oil and natural gas occurring during 2015 and continuing during 2016 are due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns and geopolitical risks. These price variations can have a material impact on our financial results and capital expenditures.\nOil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, financial markets and national and international politics. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. In the DJ Basin, oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials.\nNatural gas prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, wet natural gas with a high Btu content sells at a premium to low Btu content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGL. Location differentials to NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas' proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant, generally in the form of percentage of proceeds. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the DJ Basin is based on CIG prices, adjusted for certain deductions.\nOur price for NGL produced in the DJ Basin is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mont Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed.\nThe following table provides the high and low prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices and our differential to the average of those benchmark prices for the periods indicated. In the table below, the NYMEX averages and our average realized prices, with and without derivative settlements, are calculated based on\nthe average of each month's prices for the periods indicated. The differential varies, but our oil, natural gas and NGL normally sells at a discount to the NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub price, as applicable.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

from time to time we enter into derivative arrangements for our oil and natural gas production. By removing a significant portion of price volatility associated with our oil production, we believe we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential negative effects of reductions in oil prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods. However, in a portion of our current positions, our hedging activity may also reduce our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices. We will sustain losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and, conversely, we will realize gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices. In certain circumstances, where we have unrealized gains in our derivative portfolio, we may choose to restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of our existing positions. See -Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk\u201d for information regarding our exposure to market risk, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, and our commodity derivative contracts.\nWe will continue to use commodity derivative instruments to hedge our price risk in the future. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion and may be different than what we have done on a historical basis. As a result of recent volatility in the price of oil and natural gas, we have relied on a variety of hedging strategies and instruments to hedge our future price risk. We have utilized swaps, put options, and call options, which in some instances require the payment of a premium, to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. We expect to continue to use a variety of hedging strategies and instruments for the foreseeable future.\nA swap has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed price, the counterparty pays us an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the fixed price, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume.\nA put option has an established floor price. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium to enter into the put option. When the settlement price is below the floor price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires worthless. Some of our purchased put options have deferred premiums. For the deferred premium puts, we agreed to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement.\nA call option has an established ceiling price. The buyer of the call option pays the seller a premium to enter into the call option. When the settlement price is above the ceiling price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the ceiling price, the call option expires worthless.\nWe combine swaps, purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options in order to achieve various hedging strategies. Some examples of our hedging strategies are collars which include purchased put options and sold call options, three-way collars which include purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options, and enhanced swaps, which include either sold put options or sold call options with the associated premiums rolled into an enhanced fixed price swap. We have historically relied on commodity derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to lower commodity prices.\nWe have historically been able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at prices that are significantly higher than current strip prices. However, in the current commodity price environment, our ability to enter into comparable derivative arrangements at favorable prices may be limited, and, we are not obligated to hedge a specific portion of our oil or natural gas production.

working interest. Such costs include labor, superintendence, supplies, repairs, maintenance, water injection and disposal costs, allocated overhead charges, workover, insurance and other expenses incidental to production, but exclude lease acquisition or drilling or completion expenses. LOEs also include expenses incurred to gather and deliver natural gas to the processing plant and/or selling point.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred approximately $317.5 million in drilling 103 gross (90 net) wells with an average lateral length of 1.5 miles and completing 72 gross (55 net) wells with an average lateral length of 1.3 miles. In addition, we incurred approximately $32.1 million of leaseholds and surface acreage additions and approximately $5.1 million of midstream, excluding amounts that were paid for acquisitions. Our 2016 budget allocated approximately $335.0 million to the drilling of 100 gross (90 net) wells with an average lateral length of 1.5 miles and the completion of 92 gross (82 net) wells with an average lateral length of 1.3 miles, approximately $5.0 million to midstream, and approximately $25.0 million to leaseholds, excluding amounts that were paid for acquisitions. We transitioned to enhanced completions during the fourth quarter of 2016. These enhanced completions are included in our 2017 budget and guidance, however, they were not included in our 2016 budget, which resulted in fewer wells completed than budgeted during 2016.\nOur 2017 capital budget is approximately $795 million to $935 million, substantially all of which we intend to allocate to the Core DJ Basin. We intend to allocate approximately $675 million to $775 million of our 2017 capital budget to the drilling of 185 to 190 gross operated wells and the completion of 190 to 195 gross operated wells, approximately $60 to $80 million of non-operated drilling and completion, and approximately $60 million to $80 million to undeveloped leasehold acquisitions, midstream, and other capital expenditures. We are currently running a three-rig program and plan to use a fourth rig on a spot basis to fill in gaps in the drilling program. Our capital budget excludes any amounts that were or may be paid for potential acquisitions.\nThe amount and timing of these capital expenditures is within our control and subject to our management's discretion. We retain the flexibility to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. Any postponement or elimination of our development drilling program could result in a reduction of proved reserve volumes and related standardized measure. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) adjusted for certain cash and non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (\"DD&A\"), impairment of long lived assets, exploration expenses, rig termination fees, acquisition transaction expenses, commodity derivative (gain) loss, settlements on commodity derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the period, unit and stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, interest expense, income taxes, and non-recurring charges.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital, hedging strategy and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies.

Crude oil sales revenues increased by $37.1 million to $194.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to crude oil sales of $157.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $53.4 million positive impact, while a decrease in crude oil prices contributed a $16.3 million negative impact.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our crude oil sales averaged 14.4 MBbl/d. Our crude oil sales volume increased 34% to 5,287.4 MBbl in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 3,945.6 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2015. The volume increase was primarily due to the development of our properties. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016, we completed 72 gross wells. Offsetting the increased production from these new wells was the normal decline on the existing producing properties.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of crude oil was $36.70 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $39.80 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNatural gas sales revenues. Natural gas sales revenues increased by $22.7 million to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to natural gas sales revenues of $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed $22.7 million positive impact, while the change in natural gas prices had a de minimis impact.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our natural gas sales averaged 55.2 MMcf/d. Natural gas sales volumes increased by 87% to 20,211.5 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 10,823.0 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2015. The volume increase was primarily due to the development of our properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed 72 gross wells. Offsetting the increased production from these new wells was the normal decline on the existing producing properties.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was $2.41 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.40 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNGL sales revenues. NGL revenues increased by $20.7 million to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to NGL revenues of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $10.5 million positive impact, while an increase in price contributed a $10.2 million positive impact.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our NGL sales averaged 6.2 MBbl/d. NGL sales volumes increased by 71% to 2,284.0 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 1,334.6 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2015. The volume increase was due to the development of our properties. Our NGL sales are directly associated with our natural gas sales since the majority of our natural gas volumes are processed by third parties which return a percentage of the proceeds from both residue natural gas sales and NGL sales.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of our NGL was $15.49 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $11.02 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLease operating expenses. Our LOE, increased by $31.4 million to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in LOE was comprised of an increase in transportation and gathering ( T&G\u201d) expense of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and an increase in operating expenses of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn a per unit basis, LOE, increased $1.35 per BOE from $4.32 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $5.67 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was comprised of an increase in T&G expense of $1.38 per BOE from $0.93 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2.31 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in T&G per BOE was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $0.03 per BOE from $3.39 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3.36 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in LOE was primarily the result of an increase in T&G fees on gas sales as a result of the Company entering into more fee-type gas transportation contracts versus percent of proceeds gas transportation contracts.\nProduction taxes. Our production taxes increased by $3.7 million to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was attributable to increased revenue as State of Colorado production taxes are calculated as a percentage of sales revenue. Production taxes as a percentage of sales revenue was 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Production tax rates can vary depending on the location and the volumes produced from our properties.\nExploration expenses. Our exploration expenses were $36.4 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We recognized $14.1 million in expense attributable to the extension of leases and\n$22.3 million in expense attributable to the abandonment and impairment of unproved properties for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized $2.2 million in expense attributable to the extension of leases and $16.4 million in expense attributable to the abandonment and impairment of unproved properties for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense ( DD&A\u201d). Our DD&A expense increased $58.8 million to $205.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $146.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to higher volumes sold for the year ended December 31, 2016 as sales increased by approximately 3,856.0 MBoe. On a per unit basis, DD&A expense decreased from $20.69 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $18.77 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of long lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $22.5 million in impairment expense on proved oil and gas properties in our northern field. The future undiscounted cash flows did not exceed its carrying amount associated with its proved oil and gas properties in our northern field and it was determined that the proved oil and gas properties had no remaining fair value. Therefore, the full net book value of these proved oil and gas properties were impaired at June 30, 2016. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized $0.9 million of impairment on other property and equipment. During 2015, we sold proved oil and gas properties for proceeds of $4.7 million. In connection with the sale, we determined that assets' net book value exceeded the fair value of such properties by $2.7 million. We recognized that amount as an impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2015, we also recorded impairment expense of $9.5 million related to impairment of a subsidiary. Our subsidiary had negative future undiscounted cash flows associated with its proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2015, and it was determined that our subsidiary's proved oil and gas properties had no remaining fair value. Therefore, our subsidiary's full net book value of proved oil and gas properties were impaired. Additionally, we recognized $3.6 million in impairment expense related to a specifically proposed gas processing plant that is no longer being pursued.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $10.0 million on the write off of a non-refundable payment related to an option to acquire additional acreage. In March 2017, we entered into an amendment to this agreement with Bayswater to terminate both our and Bayswater's options for no further consideration. Also included in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 is a $0.9 million rig termination fee related to the early termination of a rig in February 2016. Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were comprised of a $1.7 million rig termination fee related to the early termination of a rig in March 2015 and a rig standby fee of $0.7 million in September 2015.\nAcquisition transaction expenses. As part of the acquisition of properties in August 2016 and October 2016, respectively, we incurred $2.7 million of transaction costs associated with a finder's fee, legal expense and due diligence for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $6.0 million of non-cash transaction costs associated with a finder's fee to an unaffiliated third-party as part of the acquisition of properties in March 2015. We assigned an over-riding royalty interest in the proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in March 2015, which had a fair value of $6.0 million on the measurement date, as payment for the finder's fee.\nGeneral and administrative expenses ( G&A\u201d). General and administrative expenses increased by $195.3 million to $232.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was comprised of an increase in unit and stock-based compensation of $194.3 million and an increase in other general and administrative expenses of $1.0 million. On a per unit basis, G&A expenses increased from $5.24 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $21.24 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur G&A expenses includes the non-cash expense for unit and stock-based compensation for equity awards granted to our employees and non-employee consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, unit and stock-based compensation expense was $200.3 million as compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. On a per unit basis, unit and stock-based compensation increased $17.47 per BOE from $0.84 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $18.31 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in unit and stock-based compensation expense was due to accelerated vesting of outstanding Holdings RUAs in connection with our Corporate Reorganization and IPO. Additionally, as a result of the IPO, Holdings incentive units were converted to common stock resulting in $172.1 million of stock-based compensation expense. Also, we created a Long Term Incentive Plan, which resulted in the granting of RSUs and stock options to certain board members, officers, and employees.\nOur other G&A expenses increased by $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the growth of the Company, however on a per BOE basis, other G&A expenses per BOE sold decreased $1.47 per BOE sold from $4.40 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2.93 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in other G&A expenses on a per BOE basis is due to increases in production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCommodity derivative gain (loss). Primarily due to the increase in NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 and change in fair value from the execution of new positions, we incurred a net loss on our commodity derivatives of $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Primarily due to the decrease in NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 and change in fair value from the execution of new positions, we incurred a net gain on our commodity derivatives of $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These losses and gains are a result of our hedging program, which is used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The fair value of the open commodity derivative instruments will continue to change in value until the transactions are settled and we will likely add to our hedging program. Therefore, we expect our net income (loss) to reflect the volatility of commodity price forward markets. Our cash flow will only be affected upon settlement of the transactions at the current market prices at that time. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we received cash settlements of commodity derivatives totaling $34.2 million and $59.8 million, respectively.\nInterest expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on our long term debt, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of capitalized interest. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized interest expense of approximately $68.8 million as compared to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, borrowings on our Second Lien Notes, our Senior Notes and the amortization of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount upon the repayment of our Second Lien Notes.\nWe incurred interest expense the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $50.5 million related to our revolving credit facility, our Senior Notes in 2016 and our Second Lien Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the accelerated amortization of our remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs of $15.1 million upon the repayment of our Second Lien Notes in July 2016, and the amortization of debt issuance costs on our Second Lien Notes, Senior Notes and credit facility of $4.2 million, excluding the accelerated amortization of the remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs on our Second Lien Notes. Also included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a prepayment penalty in the amount of $4.3 million incurred upon the repayment of our Second Lien Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $50.7 million of interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and Second Lien Notes and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $5.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized interest expense of $5.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nIncome tax benefit. We recorded an income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $29.3 million, resulting in effective tax rate of approximately 6%. Our effective tax rate for 2016 differs from the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, permanent taxable differences and the Corporate Reorganization. Nondeductible stock compensation expense made up the majority of the permanent items which related to the conversion of incentive units to common stock. See Note 11 - Unit and Stock-Based Compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of Holdings' Incentive Units. Prior to the Corporate Reorganization we were organized as a limited liability company that was not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Excluding the impact of the Corporate Reorganization and nondeductible stock compensation, our overall effective tax rate was 35%. For 2016, our combined federal and state statutory tax rate was 38%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOil sales revenues. Crude oil sales revenues increased by $81.6 million to $157.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to crude oil sales of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $215.8 million positive impact, which was partially offset by a $134.2 million negative impact due to declining crude oil prices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our crude oil sales averaged 10.8 MBbls/d. Our crude oil sales volume increased 286% to 3,945.6 MBbls in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1,022.2 MBbls in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. The volume increase was due to the development of our properties as well as our acquisitions during 2015 and 2014. Of the 2,923.4 MBbls increase in crude oil sales volume, 651.9 MBbls was related to the increase in production from producing wells acquired and 2,271.5 MBbls is attributed to our ongoing development of our properties and undeveloped acreage.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of crude oil was $39.80 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $73.82 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNatural gas sales revenues. Natural gas revenues increased by $16.8 million to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to natural gas revenues of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $28.3 million positive impact, which was partially offset by an $11.5 million negative impact due to declining natural gas prices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our natural gas sales averaged 29.7 MMcf/d. Natural gas sales volumes increased by 306% to 10,823.0 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2,664.1 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2014. The volume increase was due to the development of our properties as well as our acquisitions during 2015 and 2014. Of the 8,158.9 MMcf increase in natural gas sales volume, 3,072.5 MMcf was related to the increase in production from producing wells acquired and 5,086.4 MMcf was attributed to our ongoing development of our properties and undeveloped acreage.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was $2.40 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $3.47 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNGL sales revenues. NGL revenues increased by $6.6 million to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to NGL revenues of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $25.2 million positive impact, which was offset by an $18.6 million negative impact due to declining NGL prices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our NGL sales averaged 3.7 Bbl/d. NGL sales volumes increased by 310% to 1,334.6 MBbls for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 325.3 MBbls for the year ended December 31, 2014. The volume increase was due to the development of our properties as well as our acquisitions during 2015 and 2014. Our NGL sales are directly associated with our natural gas sales since the majority of our natural gas volumes are processed by third parties which return a percentage of the proceeds from both residue natural gas sales and NGL sales.\nThe average price we realized on the sale of our NGL was $11.02 per Bbl in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.00 per Bbl in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLease operating expenses Our LOE (including transportation and gathering expense) increased by $25.6 million to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn a per unit basis, LOE increased from $2.83 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $4.32 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of properties in March 2015, which included older vertical wells that have higher cost, on a per BOE sold basis, than our newer horizontal wells. As wells mature, we expect to incur additional costs to put these wells on artificial lift, which increases costs in fuel, electricity and related expenses.\nProduction taxes. Our production taxes increased by $7.3 million to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was attributable to increased revenue as State of Colorado production taxes are calculated as a percentage of sales revenue. Production taxes as a percentage of sales revenue was 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExploration expenses. Our exploration expenses were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We recognized $16.4 million in impairment expense attributable to the abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and $2.2 million for extensions on leases for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014, there were no significant exploration expenses or abandonment and impairment of unproved properties.\nDepletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense Our DD&A expense increased $112.5 million to $146.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to higher volumes sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 as sales increased by approximately 5,292.4 MBoe. On a per unit basis, DD&A expense increased from $19.00 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.69 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nImpairment of long lived assets. During 2015, we sold proved oil and gas properties for proceeds of $4.7 million. In connection with the sale, we determined that assets' net book value exceeded the fair value of such properties by $2.7 million. We recognized that amount as an impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2015, we also recorded impairment expense of $9.5 million related to impairment of a subsidiary. Our subsidiary had negative future undiscounted cash flows associated with its proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2015, and it was determined that our subsidiary's proved oil and gas properties had no remaining fair value. Therefore, our subsidiary's full net book value of proved oil and gas properties were impaired. Additionally, we recognized $3.6 million in impairment expense related to a specifically proposed gas processing plant that is no longer being pursued.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were comprised of a $1.7 million rig termination fee related to the early termination of a rig in March 2015 and $0.7 million related to rig standby fees in September 2015. There were no other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAcquisition transaction expenses. As part of the acquisition of properties in March 2015, we incurred $6.0 million of non-cash transaction costs associated with a finder's fee to an unaffiliated third-party. We assigned an over-riding royalty interest in the proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in March 2015, which had a fair value of $6.0 million on the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not recognize any non-cash acquisition transaction expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses G&A expense increased by $17.6 million to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to the growth in personnel and related costs as we have expanded our operational activities. On a per unit basis, G&A expense decreased from $10.94 per BOE sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $5.24 per BOE sold in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our increase in sales volumes from our acquisitions and our ongoing development program.\nOur G&A expense includes the non-cash expense for unit-based compensation for equity awards granted to our employees and non-employee consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2015, unit-based compensation expense was $6.0 million as compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCommodity derivative gain. We began using commodity derivatives in September 2014. Primarily due to the decrease in NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, we incurred a net gain on our commodity derivatives of $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain was a result of our hedging program, which is used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received cash settlements of commodity derivatives totaling $59.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nInterest expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on our long term debt, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of capitalized interest. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized interest expense of approximately $51.0 million as compared to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our Second Lien Notes.\nWe incurred interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $50.7 million and $23.1 million, respectively, related to our revolving credit facility and our Second Lien Notes. Also included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Additionally, during 2015, we incurred $1.4 million related to a potential financing transaction, and we recorded such amount as amortization expense for the year ended December 31,\n2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized interest costs of $5.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows generated by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Depending upon market conditions and other factors, we may also issue equity and debt securities if needed.\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our Second Lien Notes, our Senior Notes (please refer to Note 5 - Long Term Debt), equity provided by investors, including our management team, cash from the IPO and Private Placement and cash flows from operations. To date, our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition of oil and gas properties to increase our acreage position, as well as development and exploration of oil and gas properties. Our borrowings, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, were approximately $538.1 million and $637.8 million at December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also have other contractual commitments, which are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nWe plan to continue our practice of entering into hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Under this strategy, we intend to enter into commodity derivative contracts at times and on terms desired to maintain a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts covering approximately 50% to 80% of our projected oil and natural gas production over a one-to-two year period at a given point in time, although we may from time to time hedge more or less than this approximate range.\nBased on current expectations, we believe we have sufficient liquidity through our existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to execute our current capital program, excluding any acquisitions we may consummate, make our interest payments on the Senior Notes and pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\nIf cash flow from operations does not meet our expectations, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures using borrowings under our revolving credit facility, issuances of debt and equity securities or from other sources, such as asset sales. We cannot assure you that necessary capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness could be limited by the covenants in our debt arrangements. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain our production or proved reserves.\nOur 2017 capital budget is approximately $795 million to $935 million, substantially all of which we intend to allocate to the Core DJ Basin. We intend to allocate approximately $675 million to $775 million of our 2017 capital budget to the drilling of 185 to 190 gross operated wells and the completion of 190 to 195 gross operated wells, approximately $60 to $80 million of non-operated drilling and completion, and approximately $60 million to $80 million to undeveloped leasehold acquisitions, midstream, and other capital expenditures. We are currently running a three-rig program and plan to use a fourth rig on a spot basis to fill in gaps in the drilling program.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,388 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n166,683 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n77,390 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(915,808) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(520,006) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(970,640) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,291,050 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n371,404 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n972,090 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $50.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in changes in current assets and liabilities of $59.6 million, along with a decrease in cash settlements, including changes to accounts receivable and accounts payable on commodity derivatives of $12.9 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in sales volume of 3,856.0 MBOE and the associated increase in revenue less operating expenses.\nNet cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash used in investing activities increased by $395.8 million primarily due to $298.5 million in additional acquisition of properties, an increase of $52.3 million in cash held in escrow for acquisitions as required under the related purchase and sale agreements, and a reduction of cash received from the sale of property and equipment of $2.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, there was an increase of $43.0 million in cash expended for drilling and completion activities and other property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash provided by financing activities increased by $919.6 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $990.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and members units, net of issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Additionally, we issued preferred equity securities, net of repayments and dividends, in the amount of $170.8 million. These increases were offset by an increase of $241.2 million in the net repayment of debt due to the repayment of our credit facility and Second Lien Notes during the year ended December 31, 2016 with proceeds from our Senior Notes and IPO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $89.3 million, primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 5,292.4 MBoe.\nNet cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash used in investing activities decreased by $450.6 million primarily due to a decrease of $586.8 million used in acquisitions. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $150.8 million in cash expended for drilling and completion activities.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $600.7 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of units of $220.4 million. Additionally, this decrease was partially due to a decrease of $398.5 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our second lien notes. Offsetting these decreases was an $18.2 million decrease in cash used for debt and equity issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 compare to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital surplus was $379.1 million and $47.5 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our cash balances totaled $588.7 and $97.1 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nDue to the amounts that we incur related to our drilling and completion program and the timing of such expenditures, we may incur working capital deficits in the future. We expect that our cash flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility after application of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. We expect that our pace of development, production volumes, commodity prices and differentials to NYMEX prices for our oil, natural gas and NGL production will be the largest variables affecting our working capital.\nDebt Arrangements\nOur revolving credit facility has a maximum credit amount of $1 billion, subject to a borrowing base, and all of our current and future subsidiaries will be guarantors under such facility. Amounts repaid under our revolving credit facility may be re-borrowed from time to time, subject to the terms of the facility. For more information on the revolving credit facility, please see Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. The revolving credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties.\nOn May 29, 2014, we entered into a second lien credit agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders for the Second Lien Notes with an aggregate principal amount equal to $430.0 million. The full balance was repaid in July 2016 with proceeds from our Senior Notes Offering.\nIn July 2016, we closed a private offering of our unsecured 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $537.2 million. Our Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7.875%. Interest on our Senior Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, and the first interest payment was made on January 15, 2017. Our Senior Notes will mature on July 15, 2021. A portion of the proceeds of the 2016 Notes Offering was used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings and related premium, fees and expenses under our second lien notes and terminate such notes, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes, including acquisitions. Our Senior Notes are guaranteed by all of our current and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Extraction Finance Corp., the co-issuer of our Senior Notes).\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe amount available to be borrowed under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base that is redetermined semiannually on each May 1 and November 1, and will depend on the volumes of our proved oil and gas reserves and estimated cash flows from these reserves and other information deemed relevant by the administrative agent under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the borrowing base was $475.0 million, and there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nPrincipal amounts borrowed will be payable on the maturity date, and interest will be payable quarterly for alternate base rate loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for Eurodollar loans. We have a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the alternate base rate. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate (equal to the product of: (a) the LIBOR rate, multiplied by (b) a fraction (expressed as a decimal), the numerator of which is the number one and the denominator of which is the number one minus the reserve percentages (expressed as a decimal) on such date at which the administrative agent under our revolving credit facility is required to maintain reserves on \u2018Eurocurrency Liabilities' as defined in and pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) plus an applicable margin ranging from 200 to 300 basis points, depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank's reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate (as calculated above) plus 100 basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 200 basis points, depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may repay any amounts borrowed prior to the maturity date without any premium or penalty other than customary LIBOR breakage costs.\nThe revolving credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties and guarantees from us and our current and future subsidiaries. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincur additional indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsell assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmake loans to others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmake investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmake certain changes to our capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmake or declare dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhedge future production or interest rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nholding cash balances in excess of certain thresholds while carrying a balance of our revolving credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincur liens; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe revolving credit facility requires us to maintain the following financial ratios:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na current ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated current assets (includes unused commitments under our revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash and excludes derivative assets) to our consolidated current liabilities (excludes obligations under our revolving credit facility, the second lien notes and certain derivative assets), of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na maximum leverage ratio, which is the ratio of (i) consolidated debt less cash balances in excess of certain thresholds to (ii) our consolidated EBITDAX for the four fiscal quarter period most recently ended, not to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of such fiscal quarter; provided that (a) for the quarters ending between December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017, annualized EBITDAX will be based on the last six months' consolidated EBITDAX multiplied by 2, and (b) for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, annualized EBITDAX will be based on the last nine months' consolidated EBITDAX multiplied by 4/3, and (c) for the quarters ending on or after June 30, 2018, annualized EBITDAX will be based on the last twelve months' consolidated EBITDAX.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2016, we closed a private offering of our unsecured 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $537.2 million. Our Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7.875%. Interest on our Senior Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, and the first interest payment was made on January 15, 2017. Our Senior Notes will mature on July 15, 2021.\nWe may, at our option, redeem all or a portion of our Senior Notes at any time on or after July 15, 2018. We are also entitled to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes before July 15, 2018, with an amount of cash not greater than the net proceeds that we raise in certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.875% of the principal amount of our Senior Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, prior to July 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of our Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium. If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, holders of our Senior Notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nOur Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness and senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. Our Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Extraction Finance Corp., the co-issuer of our Senior Notes) that guarantees our indebtedness under a credit facility. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness (including all borrowings and other obligations under our revolving credit facility) to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.\nConvertible Preferred Securities\nWe previously issued to affiliates of Apollo $75.0 million in Series A Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series A Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears. We used $90.0 million of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem the Series A Preferred Units in full, which included a premium of $15.0 million.\nIn addition, we issued to, among others, investment funds affiliated with OZ Management LP and Yorktown $185.3 million in Series B Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series B Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we had the ability to pay up to 50% of the quarterly dividend in kind. The Series B Preferred Units were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that are entitled to receive a cash dividend of 5.875% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we have the ability to pay such quarterly dividends in kind at a dividend rate of 10% per year (decreased proportionately to the extent such quarterly dividends are partially paid in cash). Beginning on or after the later of (a) 90 days after the closing of the IPO and (b) the Lock-Up Period End Date, the Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the election of the Series A Preferred Holders at a conversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195. Beginning on or after the Lock-Up Period End Date until the three year anniversary of the closing of the IPO, we may elect to convert the Series A Preferred Stock at a conversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195, but only if the closing price of our common stock trades at or above a certain premium to our initial offering price, such premium to decrease with time. In certain situations, including a change of control, the Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 135% of the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) a 17.5% annualized internal rate of return on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock.

Additionally, for further information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, please refer to Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to our historical unaudited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells. If we do not meet such commitments, the acreage positions or wells may be lost or we may be required to pay damages if certain performance conditions are not met.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation/Deflation and Pricing\nAll of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, associated costs rise. Conversely, as prices for oil and natural gas decrease, costs decline. Cost declines tend to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion to decline commodity prices. Historically, field-level prices received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, commodity prices decreased, while during the year ended December 31, 2016, commodity prices increased. Changes in commodity prices impact our revenues, estimates of reserves, assessments of any impairment of oil and natural gas properties, as well as values of properties being acquired or sold. Price changes have the potential to affect our ability to raise capital, borrow money, and retain personnel.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of oil and gas reserves, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates include (1) oil and gas reserves; (2) cash flow estimates used in impairment testing of oil and gas properties; (3) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; (4) asset retirement obligations; (5) assigning fair value and allocating purchase price in connection with business combinations, including the determination of any resulting goodwill; (6) accrued revenue and related receivables; (7) valuation of commodity derivative instruments; (8) accrued liabilities; (9) valuation of unit and stock-based payments, and (10) income taxes. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, we believe our estimates are reasonable.\nSuccessful Efforts Method of Accounting\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs and development costs are capitalized when incurred and depleted on a units-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved reserves and proved developed reserves, respectively.\nThe costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Cost incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project has been made. The status of suspended well costs is monitored continuously and reviewed quarterly. Due to the capital-intensive nature and the geographical characteristics of certain projects, it may take an extended period of time to evaluate the future potential of an exploration project and the economics associated with making a determination of its commercial viability.\nGeological and geophysical costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of seismic studies that are utilized in development drilling within an area of proved reserves are capitalized as development costs. Amounts of seismic costs capitalized are based on only those blocks of data used in determining development well locations. To the extent that a seismic project covers areas of both developmental and exploratory drilling, those seismic costs are proportionately allocated between development costs and exploration expense.\nWe capitalize interest, if debt is outstanding, during drilling operations in our exploration and development activities.\nOil and Gas Reserves\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott, prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of all of our properties on a well-by-well basis. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nquality and quantity of available data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninterpretation of that data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\naccuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\njudgment of the independent reserve engineer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne of the most significant estimates we make is the estimate of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, projected future production, economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, operating expenses, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs and these estimates are inherently uncertain. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, our DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of oil and gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which would reduce earnings. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods.\nRyder Scott estimated all of our proved reserve quantities as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In connection with Ryder Scott performing their independent reserve estimations, we furnish them with the following information that they review: (1) technical support data, (2) technical analysis of geologic and engineering support information, (3) economic and production data and (4) our well ownership interests.\nThe following table presents information about proved reserve changes from period to period due to items we do not control, such as price, and from changes due to production history and well performance. These changes do not require a capital expenditure on our part, but may have resulted from capital expenditures we incurred to develop other estimated proved reserves.\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevisions resulting from price changes (MBOE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,666) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(48,578) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevisions resulting from production and performance (MBOE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(955) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,428 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,037 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revisions (MBOE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,621) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,150) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,038 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe recent significant decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices increases the uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves. We are unable to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. A prolonged period of depressed commodity prices may have a significant impact on the value and volumetric quantities of our proved reserve portfolio, assuming no other changes to our development plans or costs.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion.\nOur DD&A rate is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves, which incorporate various assumptions and future projections. If our estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, which in turn reduces our net income. Such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices or other changes to reserve estimates, as discussed above, and we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploration and development program, as well as future economic conditions.\nImpairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties\nProved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying amount of such property. We estimate the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares these undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will write down the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of reserves, future commodity prices, future production estimates, estimated future capital expenditures, estimated future operating costs, and discount rates commensurate with\nthe risk associated with realizing the projected cash flows. Impairment expense for proved oil and gas properties is reported in impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations, which increases accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $22.5 million in impairment expense on proved oil and gas properties in the our northern field. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $9.5 million in impairment expense on proved oil and gas properties in our northern field. The future undiscounted cash flows did not exceed its carrying amount associated with its proved oil and gas properties in our northern field and it was determined that the proved oil and gas properties had no remaining fair value. Therefore, the full net book value of these proved oil and gas properties were impaired at June 30, 2016 and 2015. In December 2015, we sold proved oil and gas properties for proceeds of $4.7 million. As result, these assets were fair valued on the date of the transaction in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. The net book value of these assets exceeded the fair value by $2.7 million, which we recognized as impairment expense. We recognized a total of $12.2 million in impairment expense attributable to proved oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2015. No impairment expense was recognized attributable to proved oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur impairment analyses requires us to apply judgment in identifying impairment indicators and estimating future cash flows of our oil and gas properties. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge.\nForward commodity prices and estimates of future production also play a significant role in determining impairment of proved oil and gas properties. As a result of lower commodity prices and their impact on our estimated future cash flows, we have continued to review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment. At December 31, 2015, our expected undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties by approximately $800.0 million, or 74%. At December 31, 2016, our expected undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties by approximately $1.7 billion, or 108%. The key assumptions used to determine the undiscounted future cash flows include estimates of future production, future commodity pricing, differentials, net estimated operating costs, anticipated capital expenditures and new wells on production. Future commodity pricing for oil and NGLs is based on five-year West Texas Intermediate strip prices, which increased 16% from an average of $48.40/Bbl at December 31, 2015 to an average of $56.23/Bbl at December 31, 2016, and on five-year Henry Hub strip prices, which increased 14% from an average of $2.70/MMBtu at December 31, 2015 to an average of $3.08/MMBtu at December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties\nUnproved oil and gas properties consist of costs to acquire unevaluated leases as well as costs to acquire unproved reserves. We evaluate significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment based on remaining lease term, drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage. When successful wells are drilled on undeveloped leaseholds, unproved property costs are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis. Impairment expense and lease extension payments for unproved properties is reported in exploration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, we recognized $22.3 million and $16.4 million in impairment expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No impairment expense was recognized attributable to unproved oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of the ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Our goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually on September 30 or whenever other circumstances or events indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying amount. If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, we determine it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the required two-step can be bypassed. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is not more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying value, we must perform the first step of the two-step impairment test and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit\nexceeds the estimated fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist, and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. We performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2016, which concluded the fair value of the reporting unit was more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying amount.\nCosts relating to the acquisition of internal-use software licenses are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the estimated useful life of the license.\nCommodity Derivative Instruments\nWe have entered into commodity derivative instruments, as described below. We have utilized swaps, put options, and call options to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. A swap has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed price, the counterparty pays us an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the fixed price, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. A put option has an established floor price. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium to enter into the put option. When the settlement price is below the floor price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires worthless. Some of our purchased put options have deferred premiums. For the deferred premium puts, we agree to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement.\nA call option has an established ceiling price. The buyer of the call option pays the seller a premium to enter into the call option. When the settlement price is above the ceiling price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the ceiling price, the call option expires worthless.\nWe combine swaps, purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options in order to achieve various hedging strategies. Some examples of our hedging strategies are collars which include purchased put options and sold call options, three-way collars which include purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options, and enhanced swaps, which include either sold put options or sold call options with the associated premiums rolled into an enhanced fixed price swap.\nThe objective of our use of commodity derivative instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage its exposure to commodity price risk. While the use of these commodity derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, such use may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements. We may, from time to time, add incremental derivatives to hedge additional production, restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of our existing positions. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\nThe commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying balance sheets as commodity derivative assets. We have not designated any of the derivative contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. Therefore, we do not apply hedge accounting to the commodity derivative instruments. Net gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments. Net gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the commodity derivative gain (loss) line on the statements of operations. Our cash flow is only impacted when the actual settlements under the commodity derivative contracts result in making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty. These settlements under the commodity derivative contracts are reflected as operating activities in our statements of cash flows.\nOur valuation estimate takes into consideration the counterparties' credit worthiness, our credit worthiness, and the time value of money. The consideration of the factors result in an estimated exit-price for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant's view. Management believes that this approach provides a reasonable, non-biased, verifiable, and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments. Please see -How We Evaluate Our Operations-Derivative Arrangements.\u201d\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe account for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and involves the use of significant judgment. In connection with a business combination, the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess or shortage of amounts assigned to assets and liabilities over or under the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase or goodwill. The amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIn estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. If sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, we must prepare estimates. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepare estimates of gas, oil and NGL reserves. We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, when a discounted cash flow model is used, the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk factors. In some instances, market comparable information of recent transactions is used to estimate fair value of unproved acreage.\nEstimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value, or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations ( ARO\u201d) consist of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil, natural gas and NGL wells, removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and land restoration in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws, and applicable lease terms. The fair value of an ARO liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate to be used; and inflation rates. In periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to the passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A over the life of the oil and gas property.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured and evidenced by a contract. We recognize revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL using the sales method of accounting, whereby revenue is recorded based on the our share of volume sold, regardless of whether we have taken our proportional share of volume produced. A receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves. We receive payment one to three months after delivery. At the end of each month, we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive. Variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month payment is received. A 10% change in our revenue accrual would have impacted total operating revenues by approximately $3.4 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUnit and Stock-Based Payments\nWe have granted restricted unit awards ( RUAs\u201d) to certain employees and nonemployee consultants, restricted stock awards ( RSUs\u201d) and stock option awards to certain employees, which therefore required us to recognize the expense in its financial statements. All unit and stock-based payments to employees are measured at fair value on the grant date and expensed over the relevant service period. Unit-based payments to nonemployees are measured at fair value at each financial reporting date and expensed over the period of performance, such that aggregate expense recognized is equal to the fair value of the restricted units on the date performance is completed. The fair value of stock option awards is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. All unit and stock-based payment expense is recognized using the straight-line method and is included within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to Note 11 - Unit and Stock-Based Compensation for additional discussion on unit and stock-based payments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing tax laws and the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income or loss are subject to examination by deferral and state taxing authorities.\nThe Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets, including net operating losses. In making this determination, the Company considers all the available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. The Company considers, among other things, its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends, and its outlook for future years. The Company believes it is more likely than not that certain net operating losses can be carried forward and utilized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company does not currently have uncertain tax positions.\nExtraction Oil & Gas Holdings, LLC, the Company's accounting predecessor, was a limited liability company that was not subject to U.S. federal income tax.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of an independent oil and gas company's activities, including its properties, financial performance, recent acquisitions, and corporate reorganization.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin. We have developed an oil, natural gas and NGL asset base of proved reserves, as well as a portfolio of development drilling opportunities on high resource-potential leasehold on contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin. We are focused on growing our proved reserves and production primarily through the development of our large inventory of identified liquids-rich horizontal drilling locations.\nOur Properties\nWe have assembled, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 109,400 net acres of large, contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin as indicated by the results of our horizontal drilling program and the results of offset operators. Additionally, we hold approximately 113,700 net acres outside of what we consider our Core DJ Basin, which we refer to as our Other Rockies Area,\u201d that we believe is prospective for many of the same formations as our properties in the Core DJ Basin. We operated 96% of our horizontal production for the year ended December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 238.1 MMBoe, of which approximately 20% were classified as proved developed reserves. For more information about our properties, please read Business-Our Properties.\u201d\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, coupled with the impact of settled derivatives, increased to $306.7 million as compared to $255.4 million in the same prior year period due to an increase in sales volumes of 3,856.0 MBoe, offset primarily by a decline of $8.02 in realized price per BOE, including settled derivatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $456.0 million as compared to net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss was driven by non-cash compensation expense of $200.3 million primarily related to the IPO and a net loss on commodity derivatives of $100.9 million, primarily due to the increase in NYMEX crude oil futures prices as December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 and change in fair value from the execution of new positions.\nAdjusted EBITDAX was $192.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $176.1 million in the same period in 2015, reflecting a 9% increase. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Adjusted EBITDAX.\u201d\nOperational Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we continued to focus on growing production while at the same time implementing operational efficiencies to reduce drilling and completion costs. We drilled 103 gross (89.8 net) horizontal wells and completed 72 gross (54.9 net) horizontal wells in the DJ Basin. As of January 2017, we are currently running a full time three-rig program and plan to use a fourth rig on a spot basis to fill in gaps in the drilling program.\nRecent Developments\nRecent Acquisitions\nNovember 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 22, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interest in approximately 9,200 net acres of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin for approximately $120.0 million, including customary closing adjustments. We also made an additional $41.1 million deposit in November 2016 in conjunction with November 2016 Acquisition, which has been reflected in the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet within the cash held in escrow line item. The deposit was made for two additional closings of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin. The first closing occurred in January 2017 and added approximately 5,300 net acres. The second closing is expected to occur in the first half of 2017 and will add approximately 800 net acres.\nOctober 2016 Acquisition\nOn October 3, 2016, we acquired additional oil and gas properties primarily located in the Wattenberg Field for total consideration of $405.3 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (the Bayswater Acquisition\u201d or October 2016 Acquisition\u201d). Upon completion of the Bayswater Acquisition, we acquired producing and non-producing assets primarily located in the central and northwest portions of the Wattenberg Field from an existing working interest partner, primarily around our existing Greeley and Windsor areas. The Bayswater Acquisition consisted of working interest in approximately 6,400 net acres and 31 gross (19 net) drilled but uncompleted wells, as of the date of acquisition. The Bayswater acquisition provided net daily production of approximately 6,900 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2016. We funded the purchase price through the issuance of $260.3 million in convertible preferred securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOption to Acquire Additional Assets from October 2016 Acquisition\nIn connection with the consummation of the Bayswater Acquisition, we paid $10.0 million for an option to purchase additional assets from Bayswater for an additional $190.0 million, for a total purchase price of $200.0 million (the Additional Bayswater Assets\u201d). The option allowed us to exercise at any time until March 31, 2017. If we were to not exercise our option to acquire the Additional Bayswater Assets, Bayswater would have the right until April 30, 2017 to elect to sell those assets to us for an additional $120.0 million, for a total purchase price for the Additional Bayswater Assets of $130.0 million. In March 2017, we entered into an amendment to this agreement with Bayswater to terminate both our and Bayswater's options for no further consideration. The $10.0 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2016 to other operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations.\nAugust 2016 Acquisition\nOn August 23, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interests in approximately 1,100 net acres of leasehold located the Core DJ Basin for approximately $13.7 million in cash. The effective date for the acquisition was August 31, 2016, with purchase price adjustments calculated as of the closing date on August 23, 2016. We expect to close on approximately 300 additional net acres related to this acquisition in the first half of 2017 for an additional $3.4 million.\nCapital Raises and Corporate Reorganization\nPrivate Placement of Common Stock\nOn December 15, 2016, we issued approximately 25.0 million shares of common stock, at a price of $18.25 per share, in a private placement of our common stock (the Private Placement\u201d). The Private Placement resulted in approximately $457.0 million of gross proceeds and approximately $441.9 million of net proceeds (after deducting placement agent commission and offering expenses). The offering of the common stock issued in connection with the Private Placement was registered in a Form S-1, filed on January 9, 2017. Proceeds from the Private Placement are going to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the Company's 2017 capital expenditures.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn October 17, 2016, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of approximately 33.3 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share and we became a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) under the ticker symbol XOG\u201d. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, we received approximately $681.0 million of aggregate net proceeds from our IPO after the underwriters exercised their option on October 24, 2016 to purchase 5.0 million additional shares in full. We used (i) $90.0 million of the net proceeds from the Offering to redeem in full the Series A Preferred Units (as defined below) and (ii) $291.6 million to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fund our 2017 capital expenditures.\nCorporate Reorganization\nExtraction Oil & Gas, Inc., formerly known as Extraction Oil & Gas, LLC, was converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation, on October 12, 2016. In connection with the IPO on October 17, 2016, Extraction Oil & Gas Holdings, LLC ( Holdings\u201d) was merged with and into Extraction, and Extraction was the surviving entity to the merger (the Corporate Reorganization\u201d). All equity holders in Holdings, other than the holders of the Series B Preferred Units (which were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of Series A Preferred Stock), but including the holders of restricted units and incentive units, received approximately 108.5 million shares of our common stock, with the allocation of such shares among our existing equity holders determined, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of Holdings, by reference to an implied valuation based on the 10-day volume weighted average price of Extraction's common stock following the closing of the IPO. The merger was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. As part of Holdings' merger with and into Extraction, all of Holdings' other subsidiaries became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Extraction.\nConvertible Preferred Securities\nWe previously issued to affiliates of Apollo Capital Management ( Apollo\u201d) $75.0 million in Series A Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series A Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we used $90.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem the Series A Preferred Units in full, which included a premium of $15.0 million.\nIn addition, we have issued to, among others, investment funds affiliated with OZ Management LP and Yorktown Partners LLC ( Yorktown\u201d) $185.3 million in Series B Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series B Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we had the ability to pay up to 50% of the quarterly dividend in kind. The Series B Preferred Units were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that are entitled to receive a cash dividend of 5.875% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we have the ability to pay such quarterly dividends in kind at a dividend rate of 10% per year (decreased proportionately to the extent such quarterly dividends are partially paid in cash). Beginning on or after the later of (a) 90 days after the closing of the IPO and (b) the earlier of 120 days after the closing of the IPO and the expiration of the lock-up period contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the IPO (the \"Lock-Up Period End Date\"), the Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the election of the Series A Preferred Holders at a conversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195. Beginning on or after the Lock-Up Period End Date until the three year anniversary of the closing of the IPO, we may elect to convert the Series A Preferred Stock at a\nconversion ratio per share of Series A Preferred Stock of 61.9195, but only if the closing price of our common stock trades at or above a certain premium to our initial offering price, such premium to decrease with time. In certain situations, including a change of control, the Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 135% of the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) a 17.5% annualized internal rate of return on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock mature on October 15, 2021, at which time they are mandatorily redeemable for cash at the liquidation preference.\nAmendment to Revolving Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2016, the borrowing base of our revolving credit facility was increased from $450.0 million to $475.0 million. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Revolving Credit Facility.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nIn connection with the IPO, Holdings was merged into the Company. Prior to this corporate reorganization, we were not subject to federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to us prior to such corporate reorganization contain no provision for federal or state income taxes because the tax liability with respect to Holdings' taxable income was passed through to our members. Beginning October 12, 2016, we began to be taxed as a C corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and subject to federal and state income taxes at a blended statutory rate of approximately 38% of pretax earnings.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and gas operations, including:\n \u00b7 Sources of revenue; \n \u00b7 Sales volumes; \n \u00b7 Realized prices on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL, including the effect of our commodity derivative contracts; \n \u00b7 Lease operating expenses ( LOE\u201d); \n \u00b7 Capital expenditures; and \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDAX (a Non-GAAP measure). \nSources of Our Revenues\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of NGL that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. Our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenues were derived 81% from oil sales, 10% from natural gas sales and 9% from NGL sales. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenues were derived 79% from oil sales, 13% from natural gas sales and 8% from NGL sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues were derived 70% from oil sales, 17% from natural gas sales and 13% from NGL sales. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nSales Volumes\nThe following table presents historical sales volumes for our properties for the periods indicated:\n\nAs reservoir pressures decline, production from a given well or formation decreases. Growth in our future production and reserves will depend on our ability to continue to add proved reserves in excess of our production. Accordingly, we plan to maintain our focus on adding reserves through organic growth as well as acquisitions. Our ability to add reserves through development projects and acquisitions is dependent on many factors, including takeaway capacity in our areas of operation and our ability to raise capital, obtain regulatory approvals, procure contract drilling rigs and personnel and successfully identify and consummate acquisitions. Please read Risks Related to the Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Industry and Our Business\u201d in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for a further description of the risks that affect us.\nRealized Prices on the Sale of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL\nOur results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to market our production effectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu during the same period. Declines in, and continued depression of, the price of oil and natural gas occurring during 2015 and continuing during 2016 are due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns and geopolitical risks. These price variations can have a material impact on our financial results and capital expenditures.\nOil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, financial markets and national and international politics. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. In the DJ Basin, oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials.\nNatural gas prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, wet natural gas with a high Btu content sells at a premium to low Btu content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGL. Location differentials to NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas' proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant, generally in the form of percentage of proceeds. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the DJ Basin is based on CIG prices, adjusted for certain deductions.\nOur price for NGL produced in the DJ Basin is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mont Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed.\nThe following table provides the high and low prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices and our differential to the average of those benchmark prices for the periods indicated. In the table below, the NYMEX averages and our average realized prices, with and without derivative settlements, are calculated based on\nthe average of each month's prices for the periods indicated. The differential varies, but our oil, natural gas and NGL normally sells at a discount to the NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub price, as applicable.\n\n (1) Based on the difference between our average realized price and the NYMEX Henry Hub Average as converted into Mcf using a conversion factor of 1.1 to 1. \nDerivative Arrangements\nTo achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, from time to time we enter into derivative arrangements for our oil and natural gas production. By removing a significant portion of price volatility associated with our oil production, we believe we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential negative effects of reductions in oil prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods. However, in a portion of our current positions, our hedging activity may also reduce our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices. We will sustain losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and, conversely, we will realize gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices. In certain circumstances, where we have unrealized gains in our derivative portfolio, we may choose to restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of our existing positions. See -Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk\u201d for information regarding our exposure to market risk, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, and our commodity derivative contracts.\nWe will continue to use commodity derivative instruments to hedge our price risk in the future. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion and may be different than what we have done on a historical basis. As a result of recent volatility in the price of oil and natural gas, we have relied on a variety of hedging strategies and instruments to hedge our future price risk. We have utilized swaps, put options, and call options, which in some instances require the payment of a premium, to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. We expect to continue to use a variety of hedging strategies and instruments for the foreseeable future.\nA swap has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed price, the counterparty pays us an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the fixed price, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume.\nA put option has an established floor price. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium to enter into the put option. When the settlement price is below the floor price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires worthless. Some of our purchased put options have deferred premiums. For the deferred premium puts, we agreed to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement.\nA call option has an established ceiling price. The buyer of the call option pays the seller a premium to enter into the call option. When the settlement price is above the ceiling price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the ceiling price, the call option expires worthless.\nWe combine swaps, purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options in order to achieve various hedging strategies. Some examples of our hedging strategies are collars which include purchased put options and sold call options, three-way collars which include purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options, and enhanced swaps, which include either sold put options or sold call options with the associated premiums rolled into an enhanced fixed price swap. We have historically relied on commodity derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to lower commodity prices.\nWe have historically been able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at prices that are significantly higher than current strip prices. However, in the current commodity price environment, our ability to enter into comparable derivative arrangements at favorable prices may be limited, and, we are not obligated to hedge a specific portion of our oil or natural gas production. The following summarizes our derivative positions related to crude oil and natural gas sales in effect as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) NYMEX WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate crude oil price on the New York Mercantile Exchange \n (2) NYMEX HH refers to the Henry Hub natural gas price on the New York Mercantile Exchange \nTable 154:", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin. We have developed an oil, natural gas and NGL asset base of proved reserves, as well as a portfolio of development drilling opportunities on high resource-potential leasehold on contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin. We are focused on growing our proved reserves and production primarily through the development of our large inventory of identified liquids-rich horizontal drilling locations.\nOur Properties\nWe have assembled, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 109,400 net acres of large, contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin as indicated by the results of our horizontal drilling program and the results of offset operators. Additionally, we hold approximately 113,700 net acres outside of what we consider our Core DJ Basin, which we refer to as our Other Rockies Area,\u201d that we believe is prospective for many of the same formations as our properties in the Core DJ Basin. We operated 96% of our horizontal production for the year ended December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 238.1 MMBoe, of which approximately 20% were classified as proved developed reserves. For more information about our properties, please read Business-Our Properties.\u201d\nFinancial Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, coupled with the impact of settled derivatives, increased to $306.7 million as compared to $255.4 million in the same prior year period due to an increase in sales volumes of 3,856.0 MBoe, offset primarily by a decline of $8.02 in realized price per BOE, including settled derivatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $456.0 million as compared to net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss was driven by non-cash compensation expense of $200.3 million primarily related to the IPO and a net loss on commodity derivatives of $100.9 million, primarily due to the increase in NYMEX crude oil futures prices as December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 and change in fair value from the execution of new positions.\nAdjusted EBITDAX was $192.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $176.1 million in the same period in 2015, reflecting a 9% increase. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Adjusted EBITDAX.\u201d\nOperational Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we continued to focus on growing production while at the same time implementing operational efficiencies to reduce drilling and completion costs. We drilled 103 gross (89.8 net) horizontal wells and completed 72 gross (54.9 net) horizontal wells in the DJ Basin. As of January 2017, we are currently running a full time three-rig program and plan to use a fourth rig on a spot basis to fill in gaps in the drilling program.\nRecent Developments\nRecent Acquisitions\nNovember 2016 Acquisition\nOn November 22, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interest in approximately 9,200 net acres of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin for approximately $120.0 million, including customary closing adjustments. We also made an additional $41.1 million deposit in November 2016 in conjunction with November 2016 Acquisition, which has been reflected in the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet within the cash held in escrow line item. The deposit was made for two additional closings of leaseholds located in the Core DJ Basin. The first closing occurred in January 2017 and added approximately 5,300 net acres. The second closing is expected to occur in the first half of 2017 and will add approximately 800 net acres.\nOctober 2016 Acquisition\nOn October 3, 2016, we acquired additional oil and gas properties primarily located in the Wattenberg Field for total consideration of $405.3 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (the Bayswater Acquisition\u201d or October 2016 Acquisition\u201d). Upon completion of the Bayswater Acquisition, we acquired producing and non-producing assets primarily located in the central and northwest portions of the Wattenberg Field from an existing working interest partner, primarily around our existing Greeley and Windsor areas. The Bayswater Acquisition consisted of working interest in approximately 6,400 net acres and 31 gross (19 net) drilled but uncompleted wells, as of the date of acquisition. The Bayswater acquisition provided net daily production of approximately 6,900 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2016. We funded the purchase price through the issuance of $260.3 million in convertible preferred securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOption to Acquire Additional Assets from October 2016 Acquisition\nIn connection with the consummation of the Bayswater Acquisition, we paid $10.0 million for an option to purchase additional assets from Bayswater for an additional $190.0 million, for a total purchase price of $200.0 million (the Additional Bayswater Assets\u201d). The option allowed us to exercise at any time until March 31, 2017. If we were to not exercise our option to acquire the Additional Bayswater Assets, Bayswater would have the right until April 30, 2017 to elect to sell those assets to us for an additional $120.0 million, for a total purchase price for the Additional Bayswater Assets of $130.0 million. In March 2017, we entered into an amendment to this agreement with Bayswater to terminate both our and Bayswater's options for no further consideration. The $10.0 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2016 to other operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations.\nAugust 2016 Acquisition\nOn August 23, 2016, we acquired an unaffiliated oil and gas company's interests in approximately 1,100 net acres of leasehold located the Core DJ Basin for approximately $13.7 million in cash. The effective date for the acquisition was August 31, 2016, with purchase price adjustments calculated as of the closing date on August 23, 2016. We expect to close on approximately 300 additional net acres related to this acquisition in the first half of 2017 for an additional $3.4 million.\nCapital Raises and Corporate Reorganization\nPrivate Placement of Common Stock\nOn December 15, 2016, we issued approximately 25.0 million shares of common stock, at a price of $18.25 per share, in a private placement of our common stock (the Private Placement\u201d). The Private Placement resulted in approximately $457.0 million of gross proceeds and approximately $441.9 million of net proceeds (after deducting placement agent commission and offering expenses). The offering of the common stock issued in connection with the Private Placement was registered in a Form S-1, filed on January 9, 2017. Proceeds from the Private Placement are going to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the Company's 2017 capital expenditures.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn October 17, 2016, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of approximately 33.3 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share and we became a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) under the ticker symbol XOG\u201d. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, we received approximately $681.0 million of aggregate net proceeds from our IPO after the underwriters exercised their option on October 24, 2016 to purchase 5.0 million additional shares in full. We used (i) $90.0 million of the net proceeds from the Offering to redeem in full the Series A Preferred Units (as defined below) and (ii) $291.6 million to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fund our 2017 capital expenditures.\nCorporate Reorganization\nExtraction Oil & Gas, Inc., formerly known as Extraction Oil & Gas, LLC, was converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation, on October 12, 2016. In connection with the IPO on October 17, 2016, Extraction Oil & Gas Holdings, LLC ( Holdings\u201d) was merged with and into Extraction, and Extraction was the surviving entity to the merger (the Corporate Reorganization\u201d). All equity holders in Holdings, other than the holders of the Series B Preferred Units (which were converted in connection with the closing of the IPO into shares of Series A Preferred Stock), but including the holders of restricted units and incentive units, received approximately 108.5 million shares of our common stock, with the allocation of such shares among our existing equity holders determined, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of Holdings, by reference to an implied valuation based on the 10-day volume weighted average price of Extraction's common stock following the closing of the IPO. The merger was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. As part of Holdings' merger with and into Extraction, all of Holdings' other subsidiaries became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Extraction.\nConvertible Preferred Securities\nWe previously issued to affiliates of Apollo Capital Management ( Apollo\u201d) $75.0 million in Series A Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series A Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we used $90.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem the Series A Preferred Units in full, which included a premium of $15.0 million.\nIn addition, we have issued to, among others, investment funds affiliated with OZ Management LP and Yorktown Partners LLC ( Yorktown\u201d) $185.3 million in Series B Preferred Units to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Bayswater Acquisition. The Series B Preferred Units were entitled to receive a cash dividend of 10% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, and we had the ability to pay up to 50% of the quarterly dividend in kind.

Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.\nSales Volumes\nThe following table presents historical sales volumes for our properties for the periods indicated:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOil (MBbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,287 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,946 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,022 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNatural gas (MMcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,212 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,823 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,664 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNGL (MBbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,284 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,335 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (MBoe)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,940 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,084 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,792 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage net sales (BOE/d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,891 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,408 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,908 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs reservoir pressures decline, production from a given well or formation decreases. Growth in our future production and reserves will depend on our ability to continue to add proved reserves in excess of our production. Accordingly, we plan to maintain our focus on adding reserves through organic growth as well as acquisitions. Our ability to add reserves through development projects and acquisitions is dependent on many factors, including takeaway capacity in our areas of operation and our ability to raise capital, obtain regulatory approvals, procure contract drilling rigs and personnel and successfully identify and consummate acquisitions. Please read Risks Related to the Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Industry and Our Business\u201d in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for a further description of the risks that affect us.\nRealized Prices on the Sale of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL\nOur results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to market our production effectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu during the same period. Declines in, and continued depression of, the price of oil and natural gas occurring during 2015 and continuing during 2016 are due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns and geopolitical risks. These price variations can have a material impact on our financial results and capital expenditures.\nOil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, financial markets and national and international politics. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. In the DJ Basin, oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials.\nNatural gas prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, wet natural gas with a high Btu content sells at a premium to low Btu content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGL. Location differentials to NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas' proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant, generally in the form of percentage of proceeds. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the DJ Basin is based on CIG prices, adjusted for certain deductions.\nOur price for NGL produced in the DJ Basin is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mont Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed.\nThe following table provides the high and low prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices and our differential to the average of those benchmark prices for the periods indicated. In the table below, the NYMEX averages and our average realized prices, with and without derivative settlements, are calculated based on\nthe average of each month's prices for the periods indicated. The differential varies, but our oil, natural gas and NGL normally sells at a discount to the NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub price, as applicable.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, from time to time we enter into derivative arrangements for our oil and natural gas production. By removing a significant portion of price volatility associated with our oil production, we believe we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential negative effects of reductions in oil prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods. However, in a portion of our current positions, our hedging activity may also reduce our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices. We will sustain losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and, conversely, we will realize gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices. In certain circumstances, where we have unrealized gains in our derivative portfolio, we may choose to restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of our existing positions. See -Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk\u201d for information regarding our exposure to market risk, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, and our commodity derivative contracts.\nWe will continue to use commodity derivative instruments to hedge our price risk in the future. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion and may be different than what we have done on a historical basis. As a result of recent volatility in the price of oil and natural gas, we have relied on a variety of hedging strategies and instruments to hedge our future price risk. We have utilized swaps, put options, and call options, which in some instances require the payment of a premium, to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. We expect to continue to use a variety of hedging strategies and instruments for the foreseeable future.\nA swap has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed price, the counterparty pays us an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the fixed price, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume.\nA put option has an established floor price. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium to enter into the put option. When the settlement price is below the floor price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires worthless. Some of our purchased put options have deferred premiums. For the deferred premium puts, we agreed to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement.\nA call option has an established ceiling price. The buyer of the call option pays the seller a premium to enter into the call option. When the settlement price is above the ceiling price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the ceiling price, the call option expires worthless.\nWe combine swaps, purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options in order to achieve various hedging strategies. Some examples of our hedging strategies are collars which include purchased put options and sold call options, three-way collars which include purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options, and enhanced swaps, which include either sold put options or sold call options with the associated premiums rolled into an enhanced fixed price swap. We have historically relied on commodity derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to lower commodity prices.\nWe have historically been able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at prices that are significantly higher than current strip prices. However, in the current commodity price environment, our ability to enter into comparable derivative arrangements at favorable prices may be limited, and, we are not obligated to hedge a specific portion of our oil or natural gas production.
