MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with information included in Item 8 of this report. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms Company\u201d, Chefs' Warehouse\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, and our\u201d refer to The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nOverview\nWe are a premier distributor of specialty foods in eight of the leading culinary markets in the United States. We offer more than 43,000 SKUs, ranging from high-quality specialty foods and ingredients to basic ingredients and staples and center-of-the-plate proteins. We serve more than 28,000 customer locations, primarily located in our 15 geographic markets across the United States and Canada, and the majority of our customers are independent restaurants and fine dining establishments. As a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers, we also sell certain of our center-of-the-plate products directly to consumers.\nWe believe several key differentiating factors of our business model have enabled us to execute our strategy consistently and profitably across our expanding customer base. These factors consist of a portfolio of distinctive and hard-to-find specialty food products, an extensive selection of center-of-the-plate proteins, a highly trained and motivated sales force, strong sourcing capabilities, a fully integrated warehouse management system, a highly sophisticated distribution and logistics platform and a focused, seasoned management team.\nIn recent years, our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth in demand for specialty food products and center-of-the-plate products in general; increased market share driven by our large percentage of sophisticated and experienced sales professionals, our high-quality customer service and our extensive breadth and depth of product offerings, including, as a result of our acquisitions of Michael's in August 2012, Allen Brothers in December 2013 and Del Monte in April 2015, meat, seafood and other center-of-the-plate products, and, as a result of our acquisition of Qzina in May 2013, gourmet chocolate, pastries and dessert; the acquisition of other specialty food and center-of-the-plate distributors; the expansion of our existing distribution centers; our entry into new distribution centers, including the construction of a new distribution center in Chicago; and the import and sale of our proprietary brands. Through these efforts, we believe that we have been able to expand our customer base, enhance and diversify our product selections, broaden our geographic penetration and increase our market share. We believe that as a result of these efforts, we have increased sales from $400,632 in fiscal 2011 to $1,192,866 in fiscal 2016.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 26, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of M.T. Food Service, Inc. (\"MT Food\"), based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the mid-1990's, MT Food is a wholesale distributor of dairy, produce, specialty and grocery items in the metro Chicago area. The purchase price for the transaction was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing with an additional $500 payable 18 months after the closing date. The aggregate purchase price was paid through cash-on-hand and the proceeds from a draw down on our delayed draw term loan facility. The final purchase price is subject to a customary working capital true-up. We will also pay additional contingent consideration, if earned, in the form of an earn-out amount which totals $500 to MT Food; the payment of the earn-out liability is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement of Gross Profit targets for the MT Food entity during the period between the acquisition date and the date the MT Food operations are transferred to our existing Chicago facility, not to exceed one year.\nOn April 6, 2015, we acquired substantially all the equity interests of Del Monte Capitol Meat Co. and substantially all the assets of certain of its affiliated companies (collectively, Del Monte\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184,074. Founded in 1926, Del Monte supplies high quality, USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood products to Northern California. The funding of the acquisition consisted of the following:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$123,893 in cash, which was funded with cash-on-hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $25,000 of additional senior secured notes that bear interest at 5.80% per annum due on October 17, 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock (valued at $22.17 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$36,750 in convertible subordinated notes issued to certain entities affiliated with Del Monte with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.50% with a conversion price of $29.70 per share; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1,258 offset received as an adjustment to the purchase price.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we have agreed to pay additional contingent consideration of up to $24,500 upon the successful achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements in certain operating metrics for our existing protein business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired by the Company over the six years following the closing.\nOn October 24, 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of Euro Gourmet Inc. ( Euro Gourmet\u201d), a wholesale specialty distributor based in Beltsville, Maryland. Founded in 1999, Euro Gourmet was a supplier of imported and domestic products. Euro Gourmet supplied more than 3,000 products to some of the finest restaurants, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, hotels and cruise lines along the mid-Atlantic United States. The total purchase price for Euro Gourmet was approximately $2,063 at closing and was funded with cash from operations.\nDebt Restructuring\nOn June 22, 2016, we refinanced our debt structure by entering into a new senior secured term loan. We used the proceeds to pay off our revolving credit facility of $96,400, our previous term loan of $1,681 and our senior secured notes of $125,000. We were required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, we wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees, is reflected in interest expense.\nOur Growth Strategies and Outlook\nWe continue to invest in our people, facilities and technology in an effort to achieve the following objectives and maintain our premier position within the specialty foodservice distribution market:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sales and service territory expansion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operational excellence and high customer service levels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expanded purchasing programs and improved buying power;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>product innovation and new product category introduction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operational efficiencies through system enhancements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating expense reduction through the centralization of general and administrative functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur growth has allowed us to improve upon our organization's infrastructure, open new distribution facilities and pursue selective acquisitions. Over the last several years, we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately 1.3 million square feet in 24 distribution facilities at December 30, 2016. From the second half of fiscal 2013 through the end of fiscal 2016, we have invested significantly in acquisitions, infrastructure and management.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nDue to our focus on menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores, our results of operations are materially impacted by the success of the food-away-from-home industry in the United States and Canada, which is materially impacted by general economic conditions, weather, discretionary spending levels and consumer confidence. When economic conditions deteriorate, our customers' businesses are negatively impacted as fewer people eat away-from-home and those who do spend less money. As economic conditions begin to improve, our customers' businesses historically have likewise improved, which contributes to improvements in our business. Likewise, the direct-to-consumer business of our Allen Brothers subsidiary is significantly dependent on consumers' discretionary spending habits, and weakness or uncertainty in the economy could lead to consumers buying less from Allen Brothers.\nVolatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our profitability. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers' establishments, which could adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit as a percentage of sales may remain relatively constant. However, some of our products, particularly certain of our protein items, are priced on a cost plus a dollar markup, which helps mitigate the negative impact of deflation.\nGiven our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, the shift in product mix resulting from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is fragmented but consolidating, and we have supplemented our internal growth through selective strategic acquisitions. We believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us, which may allow us to grow our business at a faster pace than we would otherwise be able to grow the business organically.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn addition to evaluating our income from operations, our management team analyzes our performance based on net sales growth, gross profit and gross profit margin.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net sales growth. Our net sales growth is driven principally by changes in volume and, to a lesser degree, changes in price related to the impact of inflation in commodity prices and product mix. In particular, product cost inflation and deflation impacts our results of operations and, depending on the amount of inflation or deflation, such impact may be material. For example, inflation may increase the dollar value of our sales, and deflation may cause the dollar value of our sales to fall despite our unit sales remaining constant or growing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, are driven principally by changes in volume and fluctuations in food and commodity prices and our ability to pass on any price increases to our customers in an inflationary environment and maintain or increase gross profit margin when our costs decline. Our gross profit margin is also a function of the product mix of our net sales in any period. Given our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, impact of product mix from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Financial Definitions\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net sales. Net sales consist primarily of sales of specialty products, center-of-the-plate proteins and other food products to independently-owned restaurants and other high-end foodservice customers, which we report net of certain group discounts and customer sales incentives. Net sales also include sales by our Allen Brothers subsidiary that are direct-to-consumers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of sales. Cost of sales include the net purchase price paid for products sold, plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities. Our cost of sales may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that include all costs related to their distribution network and protein processing costs in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating expenses. Our operating expenses include warehousing, processing and distribution expenses (which include salaries and wages, employee benefits, facility and distribution fleet rental costs and other expenses related to warehousing, processing and delivery) and selling, general and administrative expenses (which include selling, insurance, administrative, wage and benefit expenses and share-based compensation expense).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding indebtedness and, as applicable, the amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. Based on this definition, we believe our critical accounting policies include the following: (i) determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, (ii) inventory valuation, with regard to determining our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, (iii) valuing goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) vendor rebates and other promotional incentives, (v) self-insurance reserves, and (vi) accounting for income taxes and (vii) contingent earn-out liabilities. For all financial statement periods presented, there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe analyze customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are either conducted using cash-on-delivery terms or the account is closely monitored so that agreed-upon payments are received prior to orders being released. A failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders. We also estimate receivables that will ultimately be uncollectible based upon historical write-off experience. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance. Our accounts receivable balance was $128,030 and $124,139, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $6,848 and $5,803, as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nWe maintain reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventories. These reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions. A sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and could require a corresponding charge to earnings. We actively manage our inventory levels as we seek to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a relatively high level of inventory turnover.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, as we aggregate our component units into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty, based on a discounted cash flow approach. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing our estimated fair value to our carrying value, including goodwill. If our estimated fair value exceeds our carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of our goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if we were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeds the carrying value of our goodwill, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nWhen analyzing whether to aggregate the business components into single reporting units, the Company considers whether each component has similar economic characteristics. The Company has evaluated the economic characteristics of its different geographic markets, including its recently acquired businesses, along with the similarity of the operations and margins, nature of the products, type of customer and methods of distribution of products and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates and concluded that the business components can be combined into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty.\nAs of December 30, 2016, our annual assessment indicated that we are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment of goodwill existed, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value. Total goodwill as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 was $163,784 and $155,816, respectively.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during fiscal 2016 or 2015 indicating that the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets are not recoverable. Total finite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 were $131,131 and $132,211, respectively.\nThe assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved.\nVendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives\nWe participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, including volume and growth rebates, annual incentives and promotional programs. In accounting for vendor rebates, we follow the guidance in ASC 605-50 (Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor and EITF No. 03-10, Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers).\nWe generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold; however, in certain circumstances, we record marketing-related consideration as a reduction of marketing costs incurred. We may receive consideration in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions.\nWe record consideration that we receive for volume and growth rebates and annual incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for those incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual incentives when we earn them, generally over the agreement period. We record consideration received to promote and sell the suppliers' products as a reduction of our costs, as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us. If we received consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs, we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nEffective October 1, 2011, we began maintaining a self-insured group medical program. The program contains individual stop loss thresholds of $125 per incident and aggregate stop loss thresholds based upon the average number of employees enrolled in the program throughout the year. The amount in excess of the self-insured levels is fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and medical cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nEffective August 1, 2012, we became self-insured for workers' compensation and automobile liability to deductibles or self-insured retentions of $350 for workers compensation and $250 for automobile liability per occurrence. The amounts in excess of our deductibles are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.\nContingent Earn-out Liabilities\nWe account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios, including the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and weight the probability of these outcomes. The ultimate settlement of contingent earn-out liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors, and the board of directors has reviewed the above disclosure. Our consolidated financial statements contain other items that require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed above. These other items include our calculations for bonus accruals,\ndepreciation and amortization. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FISCAL YEAR ENDED\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 26, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015\nThe fiscal year ended December 30, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015, which consisted of 52 weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 increased approximately13.9% to $1,192,866 from $1,046,878 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the Del Monte acquisition on April 6, 2015, the MT Food acquisition on June 27, 2016, the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and organic sales growth. Del Monte contributed approximately $48,587, or 4.6%, MT Food contributed $31,630, or 3.0%, and the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $24,051, or 2.3%, to net sales growth for fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $41,720, or 4.0%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated deflation was approximately 1.2% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, driven largely by our protein division. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2015 was approximately 3.0%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 12.1% to $301,217 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 primarily due to the increased sales volumes discussed above. Gross profit margin decreased approximately 42 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016 from 25.7% in fiscal 2015. This decrease in gross profit margin related to the higher mix of protein sales in fiscal 2016 due to the acquisition of Del Monte in the second quarter of 2015 and the relative performance of Del Monte and Allen Brothers during the period. Gross profit margins decreased approximately 34 basis points in the Company's specialty division and 23 basis points in the protein division compared to margins in the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by approximately 11.2% to $253,978 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $228,311 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased 52 basis points to 21.3% for fiscal 2016 from 21.8% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our operating expenses is largely attributable to the acquisitions of Del Monte and MT Food which accounted for year-on-year increases of $12,219 and $5,155, respectively, higher warehousing and distribution costs of $4,612 and $3,405, respectively, due to increased sales levels, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 of approximately $4,797 and increased amortization expense of $1,980, partially offset by the reduction in the fair value of earn-out obligations of $10,031 in 2016.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased approximately 16.9% to $47,239 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 compared to $40,400 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 4.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to 3.9% in fiscal 2015. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales discussed above.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense increased $28,874 to $41,563 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, from $12,689 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt on June 22, 2016. As part of the refinancing, the Company retired its previous revolving credit facility, term loan and senior secured notes. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. This retirement was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the loss on debt extinguishment of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees is reflected in interest expense in the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. In addition, the Company had higher overall debt levels in fiscal 2016 as a result of financing the Del Monte acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 46.7% and 41.5% for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 is due primarily to the impact of the debt extinguishment in fiscal 2016, which significantly reduced our taxable income and amplified the impacts of permanent differences on our effective tax rate. Adjusted to remove the impact of the debt extinguishment, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 41.3%.\nNet Income\nReflecting the factors described in more detail above, net income decreased $13,186 to $3,023 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, compared to $16,209 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015.\nFiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 26, 2014\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 increased approximately 25.7% to $1,046,878 from $832,709 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the acquisition of Del Monte, as well as organic sales growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately $174,432 or 20.9%, to net sales growth for the year. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $39,737, or 4.8%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated inflation was approximately 3.0% for the year ended December 25, 2015, driven largely by certain protein and chocolate categories offset in part by deflation in the cheese, dairy and seafood categories. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2014 was approximately 5.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 31.0% to $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 from $205,158 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014 primarily due to the increased sales volumes discussed above. Gross profit margin increased approximately 103 basis points to 25.7% in fiscal 2015 from 24.6% in fiscal 2015. The increase was due\nprimarily to increased profit margins in our core specialty business and improved operating performance in our Allen Brothers subsidiary, which experienced significant cost pressure in fiscal 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by approximately 32.6% to $228,311 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 from $172,148 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014 primarily due to the increased sales volumes discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased 114 basis points to 21.8% for fiscal 2015 from 20.7% for fiscal 2014. The increase in our operating expense ratio is primarily attributable to $4,210 of amortization expense and $653 of non-cash accretion of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Del Monte. Additionally, fiscal 2014 included a $1,500 gain related to a settlement with the former owners of Michael's and the reversal of earn-out liabilities of $1,904 for our Queensgate and Allen Brothers acquisitions as the performance metrics applicable to these earn-out obligations were not achieved.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased approximately 22.4% to $40,400 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 compared to $33,010 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 3.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in sales volume and gross profit margin, partially offset by the higher operating expenses as discussed above.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense increased $4,527 to $12,689 for the year ended December 25, 2015, from $8,162 for the year ended December 26, 2014. This increase can be attributed to increased interest expense due to higher levels of debt related to the financing of our acquisitions, offset in part by a $349 gain on the sale of one of our owned properties.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 41.5% and 42.8% for the years ended December 25, 2015 and December 26, 2014, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 is due primarily to the negative impact from a New York state tax audit for the years 2010 through 2012, which was reflected in fiscal 2014. Adjusted for the impact of the audit, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was approximately 40.7%.\nNet Income\nReflecting the factors described in more detail above, net income increased $1,994 to $16,209 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015, compared to $14,215 for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe finance our day-to-day operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, operating leases, trade payables and bank indebtedness.\nOn June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a new senior secured term loan and asset based loan facility. The Company used the proceeds to pay off the revolving credit facility of $96,400, the previous term loan of $1,681 and the senior secured notes of $125,000. The revolving credit facility and previous term loan were originally due in April 2017. The senior secured notes had maturities of $50,000 in April 2018, $25,000 in October 2020 and $50,000 in April 2023. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees, is reflected in interest expense.\nSenior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility\nOn June 22, 2016, Chefs' Warehouse Parent, LLC ( CW Parent\u201d) and Dairyland USA Corporation ( Dairyland\u201d), as co-borrowers, and The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (the Company\u201d) and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC\n( Jefferies\u201d) acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) in an aggregate amount of $305,000,000 with a $50,000,000 six-month delayed draw term loan facility (the DDTL\u201d; the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility (including the DDTL), the Term Loans\u201d). Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company's Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used to repay the Company's senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds will be used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On June 27, 2016, the Company drew $14,000,000 from the DDTL to help pay for the MT Food acquisition. On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement under which the remaining portion of the DDTL was terminated, the Company's interest rate schedule was modified and the Company repaid $25,000,000 of the outstanding balance of the Term Loans. The interest rate on this facility at December 30, 2016 was 6.75%.\nThe final maturity of the Term Loan Facility is June 22, 2022. Subject to adjustment for prepayments, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to Term Loans, will be, at the co-borrowers' option, equal to either a base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. A commitment fee is payable in respect of the amount of the undrawn DDTL commitments during the period the DDTL is available, equal to a percentage equal to 50% of the interest rate with respect to Term Loans accruing interest based on the adjusted LIBO rate.\nThe Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Facility.\nAsset Based Loan Facility\nOn June 22, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset based loan facility (the ABL Facility\u201d) in the aggregate amount of up to $75,000,000. Availability under the ABL Facility will be limited to a borrowing base consisting of the difference of (a) the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves minus (b) outstanding borrowings. The co-borrowers under the ABL Facility are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000,000. The ABL Facility matures on June 22, 2021.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to loans, other than swingline loans, under the ABL Credit Facility will be, at the co-borrowers' option, equal to either a base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL Facility, including fees on the unused commitments of the lenders.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility will require compliance with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL Facility falls below a specified dollar amount or percentage of the borrowing base.\nThere were no outstanding balances under the ABL as of December 30, 2016. Borrowings under the ABL Facility will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. As of December 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $8,295,000 of the ABL facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 30, 2016, funds totaling $66,705,000 were available for borrowing under the ABL facility.\nNew Markets Tax Credit Loan\nOn April 26, 2012, Dairyland HP LLC ( DHP\u201d), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a financing arrangement under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC\u201d) program under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pursuant to which a subsidiary of Chase, provided to DHP an $11,000 construction loan (the NMTC Loan\u201d) to help fund DHPs expansion and build-out of the Bronx, New York facility and the rail shed located at that facility, which construction is required under the facility lease agreement. Borrowings under the NMTC Loan are secured by a first priority secured lien on DHPs leasehold interest in the Bronx, New York facility, including all improvements made on the premises, as well as, among other things, a lien on all fixtures incorporated into the project improvements.\nUnder the NMTC Loan, DHP is obligated to pay (i) monthly interest payments on the principal balance then outstanding and (ii) the entire unpaid principal balance then due and owing on April 26, 2017. So long as DHP is not in default, interest accrues on borrowings at 1.00% per annum. The Company may prepay the NMTC Loan, in whole or in part, in $100,000 increments.\nAs of December 30, 2016, DHP was in compliance with all debt covenants under the NMTC Loan.\nConvertible Subordinated Notes\nOn April 6, 2015, the Company issued $36,750 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.5% and a conversion price of $29.70 per share (the Convertible Subordinated Notes\u201d) to certain of the Del Monte entities as partial consideration in the Del Monte acquisition. The holders of the Convertible Subordinated Notes may, in certain instances beginning one year after issuance, redeem the Convertible Subordinated Notes for cash or shares of the Company's common stock. Moreover, the Company may pay the outstanding principal amount due and owing under the Convertible Subordinated Notes at maturity in either cash or shares of the Company's common stock. The Convertible Subordinated Notes, which are subordinate to the Company's and its subsidiaries' senior debt, are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock by the holders at any time at a conversion price of $29.70.\nLiquidity\nOur capital expenditures, excluding cash paid for acquisitions, were approximately $16,623 for fiscal 2016 . We believe our capital expenditures, excluding cash paid for acquisitions, for fiscal 2017 will be approximately $9,900. The significant decrease in projected capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is the result of the completion of the renovation and expansion of our new Bronx, NY and Las Vegas, NV distribution facilities. Recurring capital expenditures will be financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility. Our planned capital projects will provide both new and expanded facilities and improvements to our technology that we believe will produce increased efficiency and the capacity to continue to support the growth of our customer base. Future investments and acquisitions will be financed through either internally generated cash flow, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities in place at the time of the potential investment or acquisition or through the issuance of equity or debt securities, including, but not limited to, longer-term, fixed-rate debt securities and shares of our common stock.\nOn June 26, 2016, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of MT Food, based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the mid 1990's, MT Food is a wholesale distributor of dairy, produce, specialty and grocery items in the metro Chicago area. The purchase price for the transaction was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing with an additional $500 payable 18 months after the closing date.\nIn July 2015, we closed on a sale-leaseback transaction of our new Las Vegas, NV distribution facility. The property was sold for $14,645, which approximated its cost. The related on-going lease will be accounted for as an operating lease.\nOn April 6, 2015, we acquired substantially all the equity interests of Del Monte for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184,074. The funding of the acquisition consisted of the following:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$123,893 in cash, which was funded with cash-on-hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $25,000 of additional senior secured notes that bear interest at 5.80% per annum due on October 17, 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock (valued at $22.17 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$36,750 in convertible subordinated notes issued to certain entities affiliated with Del Monte with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.50% with a conversion price of $29.70 per share; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1,258 offset received as an adjustment to the purchase price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we agreed to pay additional contingent consideration of up to $24,500 upon the successful achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements in certain operating metrics for our existing protein business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired by the Company over the six years following the closing.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operations was $38,914 for fiscal 2016, an increase of $1,187 from the $37,727 provided by operations for fiscal 2015. The primary reasons for the increase in net cash provided by operations were increased cash generated through net income from operations partially offset by cash used in working capital changes. During fiscal 2016 net income decreased by $13,186. The primary cause for this decrease in net income was a loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, partially offset by the related tax impact on the loss of approximately $9,281. Exclusive of the net impact of the loss on extinguishment, which is a cash flow from financing activities, net income from operations decreased by $157. Embedded within the net income from operations decrease, non-cash charges decreased by $2,809, representing an overall decrease of cash provided by operations through net income of $2,966. The primary cause for this decrease was the $10,031 fair-value adjustment to the Company's Allen Brothers and Del Monte earn-out liabilities partially offset by the related tax impact of $4,172, organic growth as well as the cash generating impacts of the Del Monte and MT Food acquisitions. The decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash used for accounts payable changes of $16,292 and an increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets changes of $8,482 (exclusive of the tax impact of the loss on debt extinguishment, a financing activity), offset by increases in cash provided by inventory changes of $13,147 and accounts receivable changes of $8,552.\nNet cash provided by operations was $37,727 for fiscal 2015, a increase of $27,930 from the $9,797 provided by operations for fiscal 2014. The primary reasons for the increase in net cash provided by operations were increased cash generated through net income and a decrease in cash used in working capital and other operating assets and liabilities. During fiscal 2015, net income increased by $1,994 and, embedded within the net income increase, non-cash charges increased by $13,223, representing an overall increase of cash provided through net income of $15,217. The primary cause for this increase is the organic growth of the Company as well as the cash generating impacts of the Del Monte acquisition, and to a lesser extent the Euro Gourmet acquisition. Offsetting these positive impacts were increased corporate costs, including higher interest and income tax payments. The decrease in cash used for working capital was due to decreases in cash used for accounts receivable of $10,277 and inventory of $4,700, an increase in cash provided from accounts payable of $4,607, offset by a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other assets of $4,759. These improvements in working capital were due to a concerted effort by management to better control this area during these periods of high growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $35,815 for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $93,485 from the net cash used in investing activities of $129,300 for fiscal 2015. The decrease in net cash used was primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions, resulting from the Del Monte acquisition in 2015 partially offset by the cash paid for the MT Food acquisition in 2016, and lower capital expenditures the result of completing construction of our Bronx, NY and Las Vegas, NV distribution facilities offset, in part, by the sale of one of our owned facilities in fiscal 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $129,300 for fiscal 2015, an increase of $105,627 from the net cash used in investing activities of $23,673 for fiscal 2014. The increase in net cash used primarily due to increased cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received of $124,315, the result of the Del Monte acquisition, which was partially offset by reduced capital expenditures of $2,550, the result of completing construction of our Bronx, NY and Las Vegas, NV distribution facilities, and an increase in proceeds from asset disposals of $16,138, the result of the sale-leaseback of our Las Vegas, NV distribution facility and the sale of one other facility.\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $27,235 in fiscal 2016, a decrease of $63,811 from the $91,046 provided from financing activities in fiscal 2015. This decrease primarily resulted from the debt issued in 2015 to pay for the Del Monte acquisition and payments made to pay off our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2016, the result of improved cash flow from operations and lower capital expenditures.\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $91,046 in fiscal 2015, an increase of $93,744 from the $2,698 used in financing activities in fiscal 2014. This increase primarily resulted from the receipt of proceeds from our senior notes of $25,000 and the drawdown of $93,382 from of revolving credit facility to pay for the Del Monte acquisition. These proceeds were partially offset by increases in debt payments of $16,839 and use of restricted cash in fiscal 2014 of $5,578.\nCommitments and Significant Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 30, 2016.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LESS THAN\nONE YEAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>THEREAFTER\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations and software financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension exit liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest on our various outstanding debt instruments is included in the above table, except for our senior secured credit facility, which has a variable interest rate. At December 30, 2016, we had borrowings of $291.6 million under our senior secured credit facility. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, the interest rate on our senior secured credit facility was 6.75% and we incurred interest expense of $8,351. See Note 9 Debt Obligations\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA portion of the indebtedness obligations shown in the above table reflects the expiration of our Credit Facilities, not necessarily the underlying individual borrowings. In addition, cash to be paid for income taxes is excluded from the table above.\nUntil February 29, 2016, one of the Company's subsidiaries, Dairyland USA Corporation, sublet office space in one of its distribution centers from TCW Leasing Co., LLC ( TCW\u201d), an entity controlled by the Company's founders. TCW leases the distribution center from the New York City Industrial Development Agency. In connection with this sublease arrangement and TCW's obligations to its mortgage lender, Dairyland USA Corporation and two of the Company's other subsidiaries initially were required to act as guarantors of TCW's mortgage obligation on the distribution center. The mortgage payoff date is December 2029 and the potential obligation under this guarantee totaled $5,316 at December 30, 2016. By agreement dated July 1, 2005, the lender conditionally released all three of the Company's subsidiaries from their guaranty obligations, provided the sublease between Dairyland USA Corporation and TCW remains in full force and effect. As of February 29, 2016, Dairyland exited the sublease arrangement with TCW, triggering the guarantee obligation. The Company believes that the fair value of the building securing the mortgage more than offsets any potential obligation. In addition, TCW is actively pursuing business strategies that upon completion will unconditionally and fully release the Company from any guaranty of TCW's mortgage loan.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $8,295 and $5,945 at December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure our borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\nSeasonality\nExcluding our direct-to-consumer business, we generally do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses, management's ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel changes, demand for our products, supply shortages, weather patterns and general economic conditions.\nOur direct-to-consumer business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with direct-to-consumer center-of-the-plate protein sales typically higher during the holiday season in our fourth quarter; accordingly, a disproportionate amount of operating cash flows from this portion of our business is generated by our direct-to-consumer business in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\nDespite a significant portion of these sales occurring in the fourth quarter, there are operating expenses, principally advertising and promotional expenses, throughout the year.\nInflation\nOur profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials, labor, energy and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our customers. The impact of inflation on food, labor, energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.", "summary": "The MD&A report provides an overview and recent developments of The Chefs' Warehouse, a distributor of specialty foods in the U.S. The company has expanded its customer base, diversified product offerings, increased market share, and invested in acquisitions, infrastructure, and management. Recent acquisitions include M.T. Food Services, Inc., Del Monte, and Euro Gourmet Inc. The company also restructured its debt and continues to invest in growth strategies. The report also discusses key financial definitions, critical accounting policies, and recent accounting pronouncements. The results of operations for the fiscal years ending December 2016 and December 2015 are provided, including the changes in net sales, gross profit, operating expenses, other expenses, provision for income taxes, and net income. The analysis reveals an increase in net sales, gross profit, and operating income for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2016 compared to the previous year but a decrease in net income, primarily attributed to increased operating expenses and other expenses.", "item_7_tables": "Table 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FISCAL YEAR ENDED\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 26, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with information included in Item 8 of this report. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms Company\u201d, Chefs' Warehouse\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, and our\u201d refer to The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nOverview\nWe are a premier distributor of specialty foods in eight of the leading culinary markets in the United States. We offer more than 43,000 SKUs, ranging from high-quality specialty foods and ingredients to basic ingredients and staples and center-of-the-plate proteins. We serve more than 28,000 customer locations, primarily located in our 15 geographic markets across the United States and Canada, and the majority of our customers are independent restaurants and fine dining establishments. As a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers, we also sell certain of our center-of-the-plate products directly to consumers.\nWe believe several key differentiating factors of our business model have enabled us to execute our strategy consistently and profitably across our expanding customer base. These factors consist of a portfolio of distinctive and hard-to-find specialty food products, an extensive selection of center-of-the-plate proteins, a highly trained and motivated sales force, strong sourcing capabilities, a fully integrated warehouse management system, a highly sophisticated distribution and logistics platform and a focused, seasoned management team.\nIn recent years, our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth in demand for specialty food products and center-of-the-plate products in general; increased market share driven by our large percentage of sophisticated and experienced sales professionals, our high-quality customer service and our extensive breadth and depth of product offerings, including, as a result of our acquisitions of Michael's in August 2012, Allen Brothers in December 2013 and Del Monte in April 2015, meat, seafood and other center-of-the-plate products, and, as a result of our acquisition of Qzina in May 2013, gourmet chocolate, pastries and dessert; the acquisition of other specialty food and center-of-the-plate distributors; the expansion of our existing distribution centers; our entry into new distribution centers, including the construction of a new distribution center in Chicago; and the import and sale of our proprietary brands. Through these efforts, we believe that we have been able to expand our customer base, enhance and diversify our product selections, broaden our geographic penetration and increase our market share. We believe that as a result of these efforts, we have increased sales from $400,632 in fiscal 2011 to $1,192,866 in fiscal 2016.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 26, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of M.T. Food Service, Inc. (\"MT Food\"), based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the mid-1990's, MT Food is a wholesale distributor of dairy, produce, specialty and grocery items in the metro Chicago area. The purchase price for the transaction was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing with an additional $500 payable 18 months after the closing date. The aggregate purchase price was paid through cash-on-hand and the proceeds from a draw down on our delayed draw term loan facility. The final purchase price is subject to a customary working capital true-up. We will also pay additional contingent consideration, if earned, in the form of an earn-out amount which totals $500 to MT Food; the payment of the earn-out liability is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement of Gross Profit targets for the MT Food entity during the period between the acquisition date and the date the MT Food operations are transferred to our existing Chicago facility, not to exceed one year.\nOn April 6, 2015, we acquired substantially all the equity interests of Del Monte Capitol Meat Co. and substantially all the assets of certain of its affiliated companies (collectively, Del Monte\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184,074. Founded in 1926, Del Monte supplies high quality, USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood products to Northern California. The funding of the acquisition consisted of the following:\n \u2022 $123,893 in cash, which was funded with cash-on-hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $25,000 of additional senior secured notes that bear interest at 5.80% per annum due on October 17, 2020; \n \u2022 approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock (valued at $22.17 per share); \n \u2022 $36,750 in convertible subordinated notes issued to certain entities affiliated with Del Monte with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.50% with a conversion price of $29.70 per share; and \n \u2022 $1,258 offset received as an adjustment to the purchase price. \nIn addition, we have agreed to pay additional contingent consideration of up to $24,500 upon the successful achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements in certain operating metrics for our existing protein business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired by the Company over the six years following the closing.\nOn October 24, 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of Euro Gourmet Inc. ( Euro Gourmet\u201d), a wholesale specialty distributor based in Beltsville, Maryland. Founded in 1999, Euro Gourmet was a supplier of imported and domestic products. Euro Gourmet supplied more than 3,000 products to some of the finest restaurants, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, hotels and cruise lines along the mid-Atlantic United States. The total purchase price for Euro Gourmet was approximately $2,063 at closing and was funded with cash from operations.\nDebt Restructuring\nOn June 22, 2016, we refinanced our debt structure by entering into a new senior secured term loan. We used the proceeds to pay off our revolving credit facility of $96,400, our previous term loan of $1,681 and our senior secured notes of $125,000. We were required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, we wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees, is reflected in interest expense.\nOur Growth Strategies and Outlook\nWe continue to invest in our people, facilities and technology in an effort to achieve the following objectives and maintain our premier position within the specialty foodservice distribution market:\n \u2022 sales and service territory expansion; \n \u2022 operational excellence and high customer service levels; \n \u2022 expanded purchasing programs and improved buying power; \n \u2022 product innovation and new product category introduction; \n \u2022 operational efficiencies through system enhancements; and \n \u2022 operating expense reduction through the centralization of general and administrative functions. \nOur growth has allowed us to improve upon our organization's infrastructure, open new distribution facilities and pursue selective acquisitions. Over the last several years, we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately 1.3 million square feet in 24 distribution facilities at December 30, 2016. From the second half of fiscal 2013 through the end of fiscal 2016, we have invested significantly in acquisitions, infrastructure and management.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nDue to our focus on menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores, our results of operations are materially impacted by the success of the food-away-from-home industry in the United States and Canada, which is materially impacted by general economic conditions, weather, discretionary spending levels and consumer confidence. When economic conditions deteriorate, our customers' businesses are negatively impacted as fewer people eat away-from-home and those who do spend less money. As economic conditions begin to improve, our customers' businesses historically have likewise improved, which contributes to improvements in our business. Likewise, the direct-to-consumer business of our Allen Brothers subsidiary is significantly dependent on consumers' discretionary spending habits, and weakness or uncertainty in the economy could lead to consumers buying less from Allen Brothers.\nVolatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our profitability. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers' establishments, which could adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit as a percentage of sales may remain relatively constant. However, some of our products, particularly certain of our protein items, are priced on a cost plus a dollar markup, which helps mitigate the negative impact of deflation.\nGiven our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, the shift in product mix resulting from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is fragmented but consolidating, and we have supplemented our internal growth through selective strategic acquisitions. We believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us, which may allow us to grow our business at a faster pace than we would otherwise be able to grow the business organically.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn addition to evaluating our income from operations, our management team analyzes our performance based on net sales growth, gross profit and gross profit margin.\n \u2022 Net sales growth. Our net sales growth is driven principally by changes in volume and, to a lesser degree, changes in price related to the impact of inflation in commodity prices and product mix. In particular, product cost inflation and deflation impacts our results of operations and, depending on the amount of inflation or deflation, such impact may be material. For example, inflation may increase the dollar value of our sales, and deflation may cause the dollar value of our sales to fall despite our unit sales remaining constant or growing. \n \u2022 Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, are driven principally by changes in volume and fluctuations in food and commodity prices and our ability to pass on any price increases to our customers in an inflationary environment and maintain or increase gross profit margin when our costs decline. Our gross profit margin is also a function of the product mix of our net sales in any period. Given our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, impact of product mix from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products. \nKey Financial Definitions\n \u2022 Net sales. Net sales consist primarily of sales of specialty products, center-of-the-plate proteins and other food products to independently-owned restaurants and other high-end foodservice customers, which we report net of certain group discounts and customer sales incentives. Net sales also include sales by our Allen Brothers subsidiary that are direct-to-consumers. \n \u2022 Cost of sales. Cost of sales include the net purchase price paid for products sold, plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities. Our cost of sales may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that include all costs related to their distribution network and protein processing costs in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses. \n \u2022 Operating expenses. Our operating expenses include warehousing, processing and distribution expenses (which include salaries and wages, employee benefits, facility and distribution fleet rental costs and other expenses related to warehousing, processing and delivery) and selling, general and administrative expenses (which include selling, insurance, administrative, wage and benefit expenses and share-based compensation expense). \n \u2022 Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding indebtedness and, as applicable, the amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. Based on this definition, we believe our critical accounting policies include the following: (i) determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, (ii) inventory valuation, with regard to determining our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, (iii) valuing goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) vendor rebates and other promotional incentives, (v) self-insurance reserves, and (vi) accounting for income taxes and (vii) contingent earn-out liabilities. For all financial statement periods presented, there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe analyze customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are either conducted using cash-on-delivery terms or the account is closely monitored so that agreed-upon payments are received prior to orders being released. A failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders. We also estimate receivables that will ultimately be uncollectible based upon historical write-off experience. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance. Our accounts receivable balance was $128,030 and $124,139, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $6,848 and $5,803, as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nWe maintain reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventories. These reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions. A sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and could require a corresponding charge to earnings. We actively manage our inventory levels as we seek to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a relatively high level of inventory turnover.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, as we aggregate our component units into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty, based on a discounted cash flow approach. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing our estimated fair value to our carrying value, including goodwill. If our estimated fair value exceeds our carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of our goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if we were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeds the carrying value of our goodwill, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nWhen analyzing whether to aggregate the business components into single reporting units, the Company considers whether each component has similar economic characteristics. The Company has evaluated the economic characteristics of its different geographic markets, including its recently acquired businesses, along with the similarity of the operations and margins, nature of the products, type of customer and methods of distribution of products and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates and concluded that the business components can be combined into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty.\nAs of December 30, 2016, our annual assessment indicated that we are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment of goodwill existed, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value. Total goodwill as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 was $163,784 and $155,816, respectively.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during fiscal 2016 or 2015 indicating that the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets are not recoverable. Total finite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 were $131,131 and $132,211, respectively.\nThe assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved.\nVendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives\nWe participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, including volume and growth rebates, annual incentives and promotional programs. In accounting for vendor rebates, we follow the guidance in ASC 605-50 (Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor and EITF No. 03-10, Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers).\nWe generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold; however, in certain circumstances, we record marketing-related consideration as a reduction of marketing costs incurred. We may receive consideration in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions.\nWe record consideration that we receive for volume and growth rebates and annual incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for those incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual incentives when we earn them, generally over the agreement period. We record consideration received to promote and sell the suppliers' products as a reduction of our costs, as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us. If we received consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs, we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nEffective October 1, 2011, we began maintaining a self-insured group medical program. The program contains individual stop loss thresholds of $125 per incident and aggregate stop loss thresholds based upon the average number of employees enrolled in the program throughout the year. The amount in excess of the self-insured levels is fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and medical cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nEffective August 1, 2012, we became self-insured for workers' compensation and automobile liability to deductibles or self-insured retentions of $350 for workers compensation and $250 for automobile liability per occurrence. The amounts in excess of our deductibles are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.\nContingent Earn-out Liabilities\nWe account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios, including the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and weight the probability of these outcomes. The ultimate settlement of contingent earn-out liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors, and the board of directors has reviewed the above disclosure. Our consolidated financial statements contain other items that require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed above. These other items include our calculations for bonus accruals,\ndepreciation and amortization. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales:\n\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015\nThe fiscal year ended December 30, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015, which consisted of 52 weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 increased approximately13.9% to $1,192,866 from $1,046,878 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the Del Monte acquisition on April 6, 2015, the MT Food acquisition on June 27, 2016, the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and organic sales growth. Del Monte contributed approximately $48,587, or 4.6%, MT Food contributed $31,630, or 3.0%, and the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $24,051, or 2.3%, to net sales growth for fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $41,720, or 4.0%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated deflation was approximately 1.2% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, driven largely by our protein division. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2015 was approximately 3.0%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 12.1% to $301,217 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 primarily due to the increased sales volumes discussed above. Gross profit margin decreased approximately 42 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016 from 25.7% in fiscal 2015. This decrease in gross profit margin related to the higher mix of protein sales in fiscal 2016 due to the acquisition of Del Monte in the second quarter of 2015 and the relative performance of Del Monte and Allen Brothers during the period. Gross profit margins decreased approximately 34 basis points in the Company's specialty division and 23 basis points in the protein division compared to margins in the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by approximately 11.2% to $253,978 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $228,311 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased 52 basis points to 21.3% for fiscal 2016 from 21.8% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our operating expenses is largely attributable to the acquisitions of Del Monte and MT Food which accounted for year-on-year increases of $12,219 and $5,155, respectively, higher warehousing and distribution costs of $4,612 and $3,405, respectively, due to increased sales levels, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 of approximately $4,797 and increased amortization expense of $1,980, partially offset by the reduction in the fair value of earn-out obligations of $10,031 in 2016.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased approximately 16.9% to $47,239 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 compared to $40,400 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 4.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to 3.9% in fiscal 2015. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales discussed above.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense increased $28,874 to $41,563 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, from $12,689 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt on June 22, 2016. As part of the refinancing, the Company retired its previous revolving credit facility, term loan and senior secured notes. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. This retirement was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the loss on debt extinguishment of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees is reflected in interest expense in the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. In addition, the Company had higher overall debt levels in fiscal 2016 as a result of financing the Del Monte acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 46.7% and 41.5% for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 is due primarily to the impact of the debt extinguishment in fiscal 2016, which significantly reduced our taxable income and amplified the impacts of permanent differences on our effective tax rate. Adjusted to remove the impact of the debt extinguishment, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 41.3%.\nNet Income\nReflecting the factors described in more detail above, net income decreased $13,186 to $3,023 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, compared to $16,209 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015.\nFiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 26, 2014\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 increased approximately 25.7% to $1,046,878 from $832,709 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the acquisition of Del Monte, as well as organic sales growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately $174,432 or 20.9%, to net sales growth for the year. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $39,737, or 4.8%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated inflation was approximately 3.0% for the year ended December 25, 2015, driven largely by certain protein and chocolate categories offset in part by deflation in the cheese, dairy and seafood categories. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2014 was approximately 5.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 31.0% to $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 from $205,158 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014 primarily due to the increased sales volumes", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

All dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nOverview\nWe are a premier distributor of specialty foods in eight of the leading culinary markets in the United States. We offer more than 43,000 SKUs, ranging from high-quality specialty foods and ingredients to basic ingredients and staples and center-of-the-plate proteins. We serve more than 28,000 customer locations, primarily located in our 15 geographic markets across the United States and Canada, and the majority of our customers are independent restaurants and fine dining establishments. As a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers, we also sell certain of our center-of-the-plate products directly to consumers.\nWe believe several key differentiating factors of our business model have enabled us to execute our strategy consistently and profitably across our expanding customer base. These factors consist of a portfolio of distinctive and hard-to-find specialty food products, an extensive selection of center-of-the-plate proteins, a highly trained and motivated sales force, strong sourcing capabilities, a fully integrated warehouse management system, a highly sophisticated distribution and logistics platform and a focused, seasoned management team.\nIn recent years, our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth in demand for specialty food products and center-of-the-plate products in general; increased market share driven by our large percentage of sophisticated and experienced sales professionals, our high-quality customer service and our extensive breadth and depth of product offerings, including, as a result of our acquisitions of Michael's in August 2012, Allen Brothers in December 2013 and Del Monte in April 2015, meat, seafood and other center-of-the-plate products, and, as a result of our acquisition of Qzina in May 2013, gourmet chocolate, pastries and dessert; the acquisition of other specialty food and center-of-the-plate distributors; the expansion of our existing distribution centers; our entry into new distribution centers, including the construction of a new distribution center in Chicago; and the import and sale of our proprietary brands. Through these efforts, we believe that we have been able to expand our customer base, enhance and diversify our product selections, broaden our geographic penetration and increase our market share. We believe that as a result of these efforts, we have increased sales from $400,632 in fiscal 2011 to $1,192,866 in fiscal 2016.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 26, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of M.T. Food Service, Inc. (\"MT Food\"), based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the mid-1990's, MT Food is a wholesale distributor of dairy, produce, specialty and grocery items in the metro Chicago area. The purchase price for the transaction was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing with an additional $500 payable 18 months after the closing date. The aggregate purchase price was paid through cash-on-hand and the proceeds from a draw down on our delayed draw term loan facility. The final purchase price is subject to a customary working capital true-up. We will also pay additional contingent consideration, if earned, in the form of an earn-out amount which totals $500 to MT Food; the payment of the earn-out liability is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement of Gross Profit targets for the MT Food entity during the period between the acquisition date and the date the MT Food operations are transferred to our existing Chicago facility, not to exceed one year.\nOn April 6, 2015, we acquired substantially all the equity interests of Del Monte Capitol Meat Co. and substantially all the assets of certain of its affiliated companies (collectively, Del Monte\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184,074. Founded in 1926, Del Monte supplies high quality, USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood products to Northern California. The funding of the acquisition consisted of the following:\n \u2022 $123,893 in cash, which was funded with cash-on-hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $25,000 of additional senior secured notes that bear interest at 5.80% per annum due on October 17, 2020; \n \u2022 approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock (valued at $22.17 per share); \n \u2022 $36,750 in convertible subordinated notes issued to certain entities affiliated with Del Monte with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.50% with a conversion price of $29.70 per share; and \n \u2022 $1,258 offset received as an adjustment to the purchase price. \nIn addition, we have agreed to pay additional contingent consideration of up to $24,500 upon the successful achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements in certain operating metrics for our existing protein business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired by the Company over the six years following the closing.\nOn October 24, 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of Euro Gourmet Inc. ( Euro Gourmet\u201d), a wholesale specialty distributor based in Beltsville, Maryland. Founded in 1999, Euro Gourmet was a supplier of imported and domestic products. Euro Gourmet supplied more than 3,000 products to some of the finest restaurants, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, hotels and cruise lines along the mid-Atlantic United States. The total purchase price for Euro Gourmet was approximately $2,063 at closing and was funded with cash from operations.\nDebt Restructuring\nOn June 22, 2016, we refinanced our debt structure by entering into a new senior secured term loan. We used the proceeds to pay off our revolving credit facility of $96,400, our previous term loan of $1,681 and our senior secured notes of $125,000. We were required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, we wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees, is reflected in interest expense.\nOur Growth Strategies and Outlook\nWe continue to invest in our people, facilities and technology in an effort to achieve the following objectives and maintain our premier position within the specialty foodservice distribution market:\n \u2022 sales and service territory expansion; \n \u2022 operational excellence and high customer service levels; \n \u2022 expanded purchasing programs and improved buying power; \n \u2022 product innovation and new product category introduction; \n \u2022 operational efficiencies through system enhancements; and \n \u2022 operating expense reduction through the centralization of general and administrative functions. \nOur growth has allowed us to improve upon our organization's infrastructure, open new distribution facilities and pursue selective acquisitions. Over the last several years, we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately 1.3 million square feet in 24 distribution facilities at December 30, 2016. From the second half of fiscal 2013 through the end of fiscal 2016, we have invested significantly in acquisitions, infrastructure and management.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nDue to our focus on menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores, our results of operations are materially impacted by the success of the food-away-from-home industry in the United States and Canada, which is materially impacted by general economic conditions, weather, discretionary spending levels and consumer confidence. When economic conditions deteriorate, our customers' businesses are negatively impacted as fewer people eat away-from-home and those who do spend less money. As economic conditions begin to improve, our customers' businesses historically have likewise improved, which contributes to improvements in our business. Likewise, the direct-to-consumer business of our Allen Brothers subsidiary is significantly dependent on consumers' discretionary spending habits, and weakness or uncertainty in the economy could lead to consumers buying less from Allen Brothers.\nVolatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our profitability. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers' establishments, which could adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit as a percentage of sales may remain relatively constant. However, some of our products, particularly certain of our protein items, are priced on a cost plus a dollar markup, which helps mitigate the negative impact of deflation.\nGiven our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, the shift in product mix resulting from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is fragmented but consolidating, and we have supplemented our internal growth through selective strategic acquisitions. We believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us, which may allow us to grow our business at a faster pace than we would otherwise be able to grow the business organically.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn addition to evaluating our income from operations, our management team analyzes our performance based on net sales growth, gross profit and gross profit margin.\n \u2022 Net sales growth. Our net sales growth is driven principally by changes in volume and, to a lesser degree, changes in price related to the impact of inflation in commodity prices and product mix. In particular, product cost inflation and deflation impacts our results of operations and, depending on the amount of inflation or deflation, such impact may be material. For example, inflation may increase the dollar value of our sales, and deflation may cause the dollar value of our sales to fall despite our unit sales remaining constant or growing. \n \u2022 Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, are driven principally by changes in volume and fluctuations in food and commodity prices and our ability to pass on any price increases to our customers in an inflationary environment and maintain or increase gross profit margin when our costs decline. Our gross profit margin is also a function of the product mix of our net sales in any period. Given our wide selection of product categories, as well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets that we have more recently entered, impact of product mix from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products. \nKey Financial Definitions\n \u2022 Net sales. Net sales consist primarily of sales of specialty products, center-of-the-plate proteins and other food products to independently-owned restaurants and other high-end foodservice customers, which we report net of certain group discounts and customer sales incentives. Net sales also include sales by our Allen Brothers subsidiary that are direct-to-consumers. \n \u2022 Cost of sales. Cost of sales include the net purchase price paid for products sold, plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities. Our cost of sales may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that include all costs related to their distribution network and protein processing costs in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses. \n \u2022 Operating expenses. Our operating expenses include warehousing, processing and distribution expenses (which include salaries and wages, employee benefits, facility and distribution fleet rental costs and other expenses related to warehousing, processing and delivery) and selling, general and administrative expenses (which include selling, insurance, administrative, wage and benefit expenses and share-based compensation expense). \n \u2022 Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding indebtedness and, as applicable, the amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. Based on this definition, we believe our critical accounting policies include the following: (i) determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, (ii) inventory valuation, with regard to determining our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, (iii) valuing goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) vendor rebates and other promotional incentives, (v) self-insurance reserves, and (vi) accounting for income taxes and (vii) contingent earn-out liabilities. For all financial statement periods presented, there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe analyze customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are either conducted using cash-on-delivery terms or the account is closely monitored so that agreed-upon payments are received prior to orders being released. A failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders. We also estimate receivables that will ultimately be uncollectible based upon historical write-off experience. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance. Our accounts receivable balance was $128,030 and $124,139, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $6,848 and $5,803, as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nWe maintain reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventories. These reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions. A sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and could require a corresponding charge to earnings. We actively manage our inventory levels as we seek to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a relatively high level of inventory turnover.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, as we aggregate our component units into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty, based on a discounted cash flow approach. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing our estimated fair value to our carrying value, including goodwill. If our estimated fair value exceeds our carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of our goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if we were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeds the carrying value of our goodwill, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nWhen analyzing whether to aggregate the business components into single reporting units, the Company considers whether each component has similar economic characteristics. The Company has evaluated the economic characteristics of its different geographic markets, including its recently acquired businesses, along with the similarity of the operations and margins, nature of the products, type of customer and methods of distribution of products and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates and concluded that the business components can be combined into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty.\nAs of December 30, 2016, our annual assessment indicated that we are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment of goodwill existed, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value. Total goodwill as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 was $163,784 and $155,816, respectively.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during fiscal 2016 or 2015 indicating that the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets are not recoverable. Total finite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015 were $131,131 and $132,211, respectively.\nThe assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved.\nVendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives\nWe participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, including volume and growth rebates, annual incentives and promotional programs. In accounting for vendor rebates, we follow the guidance in ASC 605-50 (Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor and EITF No. 03-10, Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers).\nWe generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold; however, in certain circumstances, we record marketing-related consideration as a reduction of marketing costs incurred. We may receive consideration in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions.\nWe record consideration that we receive for volume and growth rebates and annual incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for those incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual incentives when we earn them, generally over the agreement period. We record consideration received to promote and sell the suppliers' products as a reduction of our costs, as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us. If we received consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs, we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nEffective October 1, 2011, we began maintaining a self-insured group medical program. The program contains individual stop loss thresholds of $125 per incident and aggregate stop loss thresholds based upon the average number of employees enrolled in the program throughout the year. The amount in excess of the self-insured levels is fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and medical cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nEffective August 1, 2012, we became self-insured for workers' compensation and automobile liability to deductibles or self-insured retentions of $350 for workers compensation and $250 for automobile liability per occurrence. The amounts in excess of our deductibles are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.\nContingent Earn-out Liabilities\nWe account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios, including the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and weight the probability of these outcomes. The ultimate settlement of contingent earn-out liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors, and the board of directors has reviewed the above disclosure. Our consolidated financial statements contain other items that require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed above. These other items include our calculations for bonus accruals,\ndepreciation and amortization. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FISCAL YEAR ENDED\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 26, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015\nThe fiscal year ended December 30, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015, which consisted of 52 weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 increased approximately13.9% to $1,192,866 from $1,046,878 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the Del Monte acquisition on April 6, 2015, the MT Food acquisition on June 27, 2016, the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and organic sales growth. Del Monte contributed approximately $48,587, or 4.6%, MT Food contributed $31,630, or 3.0%, and the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $24,051, or 2.3%, to net sales growth for fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $41,720, or 4.0%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated deflation was approximately 1.2% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, driven largely by our protein division. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2015 was approximately 3.0%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 12.1% to $301,217 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 primarily due to the increased sales volumes discussed above. Gross profit margin decreased approximately 42 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016 from 25.7% in fiscal 2015. This decrease in gross profit margin related to the higher mix of protein sales in fiscal 2016 due to the acquisition of Del Monte in the second quarter of 2015 and the relative performance of Del Monte and Allen Brothers during the period. Gross profit margins decreased approximately 34 basis points in the Company's specialty division and 23 basis points in the protein division compared to margins in the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by approximately 11.2% to $253,978 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 from $228,311 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased 52 basis points to 21.3% for fiscal 2016 from 21.8% for fiscal 2015. The increase in our operating expenses is largely attributable to the acquisitions of Del Monte and MT Food which accounted for year-on-year increases of $12,219 and $5,155, respectively, higher warehousing and distribution costs of $4,612 and $3,405, respectively, due to increased sales levels, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 of approximately $4,797 and increased amortization expense of $1,980, partially offset by the reduction in the fair value of earn-out obligations of $10,031 in 2016.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased approximately 16.9% to $47,239 for the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016 compared to $40,400 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 4.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to 3.9% in fiscal 2015. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales discussed above.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense increased $28,874 to $41,563 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, from $12,689 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's debt on June 22, 2016. As part of the refinancing, the Company retired its previous revolving credit facility, term loan and senior secured notes. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. This retirement was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the loss on debt extinguishment of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees is reflected in interest expense in the fifty-three weeks ended December 30, 2016. In addition, the Company had higher overall debt levels in fiscal 2016 as a result of financing the Del Monte acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 46.7% and 41.5% for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 is due primarily to the impact of the debt extinguishment in fiscal 2016, which significantly reduced our taxable income and amplified the impacts of permanent differences on our effective tax rate. Adjusted to remove the impact of the debt extinguishment, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 41.3%.\nNet Income\nReflecting the factors described in more detail above, net income decreased $13,186 to $3,023 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, compared to $16,209 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015.\nFiscal Year Ended December 25, 2015 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 26, 2014\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 increased approximately 25.7% to $1,046,878 from $832,709 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the acquisition of Del Monte, as well as organic sales growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately $174,432 or 20.9%, to net sales growth for the year. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately $39,737, or 4.8%, of total net sales growth. Internally calculated inflation was approximately 3.0% for the year ended December 25, 2015, driven largely by certain protein and chocolate categories offset in part by deflation in the cheese, dairy and seafood categories. Internally calculated inflation for fiscal 2014 was approximately 5.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased approximately 31.0% to $268,711 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2015 from $205,158 for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2014 primarily due to the increased sales volumes"}
