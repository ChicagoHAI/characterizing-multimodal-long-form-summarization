Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments' results.\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; energy prices; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, and inventory held in the supply chain; customers' ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers' or our customers' personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.\nLike other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have entered into nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company now operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. Commencing with the first quarter of 2015, the flat products segment has been separated into two reportable segments; carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products. The flat products segments' assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments' products are stored in the shared facilities and processed on the shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology. The financial information for 2014 has been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure. The financial information for 2013 has not been recast due to system limitations and the carbon and specialty metals flat products segment financial information is reported consolidated.\nWe follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach\u201d to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.\nCarbon flat products\nThe primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCombined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 23 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe tubular and pipe products segment consists of the CTI business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including payroll expenses for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\nDue to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments' average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.\nDue to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales impacts total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the last-in, first-out, or LIFO, method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.\nResults of Operations\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe metals industry experienced a significant decline in the price of metals during 2015 as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported materials arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals and a global oversupply of metals. The price of hot-rolled carbon flat steel decreased approximately 41% during 2015. Similarly, the price of stainless steel and aluminum decreased during 2015. The declines in metals shipments and pricing have negatively impacted our 2015 sales and earnings. Industry demand has also softened in 2015 compared to 2014 as evidenced by lower year over year shipments by metals service centers in the United States. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge in our tubular and pipe products segment as a result of the continued decline in metals pricing and its impact on the tubular and pipe products segment results. The impairment charge consisted of a $16.5 million goodwill impairment, which eliminated the remaining goodwill in the tubular and pipe products segment, and a partial impairment of $8.0 million related to the segment's tradename. The tradename is an indefinitely lived intangible asset with a remaining value of $15.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $500 thousand impairment charge, which fully eliminated the goodwill in our specialty metals flat products segment.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,175,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,436,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>942,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,779 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,208 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,594 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,114 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,817 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,777 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Includes $3,347 of LIFO income for 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense for 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

Carbon flat products net sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, and were 65.1% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 68.6% in 2014. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, and were 16.4% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 14.4% in 2014. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, and were 18.5% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 17.0% of total net sales in 2014. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a 10.2% decrease in sales volume and an 8.9% decrease in average selling prices in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCost of materials sold decreased $218 million, or 18.8%, to $942 million in 2015 from $1.16 billion in 2014. During 2015, we recorded LIFO income of $3.3 million compared to LIFO expense of $365 thousand recorded in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 is primarily due to the decreased sales volume of 10.2%, decreased metals costs of 9.6% during 2015 and the impact of LIFO income during 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 19.8% in 2015 from 19.2% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 19.2% from 18.2% in 2014 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.5% from 28.9% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. LIFO increased gross profit by 0.3% of net sales in 2015 and had no consolidated gross profit impact in 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in the carbon flat rolled and tubular and pipe products segments, as well as the impact of LIFO income in 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $25.2 million, or 9.6%, to $236.2 million in 2015 from $261.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% in 2015 from 18.1% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased in all categories as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During 2015, we executed on our profit improvement plan, which contributed to the cost reductions. Distribution expense decreased by $5.2 million, or 12.7%, due to the decreased sales volume. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $6.8 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and reduced warehouse consumables expenses related to the 10.2% 2015 volume decrease. Administrative costs decreased by $7.2 million, or 10.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses, centralization of certain administrative functions, lower variable based incentive compensation and decreases in travel and entertainment expenses. Selling expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 14.7%, as a result of decreased variable compensation associated with fewer sales employees and decreased discretionary spending. Occupancy expenses decreased $560 thousand as a result of decreased heating and snow removal expenses. Depreciation expense decreased $1.7 million, or 8.8%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2014. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $19.0 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment decreased $2.4 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $1.8 million, and Corporate expenses decreased $0.9 million.\nThe goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 includes a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $500 thousand goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2014 included a $23.8 million goodwill impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $5.7 million in 2015 compared to $6.8 million in 2014. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.1% in 2015 compared to 2.4% in 2014. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average borrowing rates during 2015 compared to 2014.\nFor 2015, loss before income taxes totaled $33.6 million compared to loss before income taxes of $16.1 million in 2014. 2015 includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge and LIFO income of $3.3 million. 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the tube and pipe segment and LIFO expense of $365 thousand.\nAn income tax benefit of 20.3% was recorded for 2015, compared to an income tax provision of (18.3%) in 2013. The 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates were impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%. The income tax provision for 2014 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 38.2%. We expect our 2016 income tax rate to approximate 38% to 40%.\nNet loss for 2015 totaled $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $19.1 million, or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, for 2014. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares. The goodwill impairment in 2014 impacted earnings per basic and diluted shares by $2.14.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,037,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,166,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>765,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>985,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>618,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,217 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTons sold decreased 11.0% to 1.04 million tons in 2015 from 1.17 million tons in 2014. Toll tons sold decreased 4.1% to 102 thousand tons in 2015 from 107 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments of carbon flat products in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, to $765.4 million in 2015 from $985.0 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased 12.7% to $738 per ton, compared to $845 per ton in 2013. The decrease in sales was due to an 11.0% decrease in sales volume and a 12.7% decrease in average selling prices during 2015. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of declining prices in the metals industry during 2015 discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect market carbon flat metals prices in the first quarter of 2016 to increase slightly over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCost of materials sold decreased $187.1 million, or 23.2%, to $618.7 million in 2015 from $805.7 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 11.0% as well as a 13.7% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 19.2% in 2015 from 18.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $141 in 2015 from $154 in 2014 due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2015.\nOperating expenses in 2015 decreased $19.0 million, or 11.0%, to $153.9 million from $173.0 million in 2014 mirroring the sales volume decrease of 11.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% for 2015 from 17.6% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, decreases in travel and entertainment expenses, and lower distribution expense as a result of lower sales volumes.\nOperating loss for 2015 totaled $7.2 million compared to operating income of $6.3 million in 2014.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,574 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry wide shipments of stainless and aluminum flat products.\nNet sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, to $192.5 million in 2015 from $206.7 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased to $2,671 per ton, compared to $2,833 per ton in 2014. The decrease in sales was due to a 1.2% decrease in sales volume and a 5.7% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in the year over year average selling price per ton is a result of declining market price of nickel and aluminum, which continue to pressure stainless and aluminum pricing. We expect market stainless and aluminum prices in the first quarter of 2016 to continue to be pressured.\nCost of materials sold decreased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, to $176.7 million in 2015 from $180.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 1.2% and a 1.1% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $220 in 2015 compared to $355 per ton in 2015. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of the declining price of nickel, which is a large component of stainless steel and aluminum pricing, and the cost of our material not declining as fast as the average sell price due to slower inventory turns in 2015.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased $2.9 million, or 14.5%, to $16.9 million in 2015 from $19.8 million in 2014. The decrease in operating expenses exceeded the decrease in sales volume of 1.2%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 8.8% of net sales in 2015 from 9.5% in 2014. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and wages decreased as a result of lower sales volumes. Expenses also decreased as a result of the profit improvement plan initiated in 2015 and the decrease in variable performance-based incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015 we recorded a $500 thousand non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the continued market pressures which fully eliminated the goodwill for the specialty metals flat products segment.\nOperating loss for 2015 totaled $1.6 million compared to operating income of $6.1 million in 2015.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands).\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,868 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,651 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Includes $3,347 of LIFO income in 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> The non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, to $217.6 million in 2015 from $244.5 million in 2014. The decrease in net sales was due to a 5.7% decrease in the sales volume and a 5.6% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in volume was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments of pipe and tube products.\nCost of materials sold decreased $26.9 million, or 15.5%, to $146.9 million in 2015 from $173.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 5.7% decrease in sales volume and a 10.4% decrease in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO income of $3.3 million in 2015 compared to LIFO expense of $365 thousand in 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 32.5% in 2015 from 28.9%, in 2014. The LIFO income recorded in 2015 increased gross profit by 1.5% of net sales and the LIFO expense recorded in 2014, decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased as a result of increased value added processing sales and an increase in the product mix to higher margin sales.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $2.4 million, or 4.0%, to $58.2 million from $60.6 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 26.8% for 2015 compared to 24.8% for 2014. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and certain selling expenses, decreased as a result of lower sales volume and net sales. Depreciation expense increased as a result of recent investments in processing equipment.\nIn 2015 we recorded a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and an $8.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge. In 2014 we recorded a $23.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nOperating loss for 2015 totaled $11.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.7 million in 2014. The operating loss for 2015 was the result of the goodwill impairment of $16.5 million and the asset impairment charge of $8.0 million. The 2014 operating loss was a result of the $23.8 million goodwill impairment as well as LIFO expense of $365 thousand.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 10.7%, to $7.1 million in 2015 compared to $8.0 million in 2014. The decrease in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to decreases in travel and entertainment expenses and lower variable performance-based compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e. all three segments), including payroll expenses for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,436,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,263,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>999,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,208 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (loss), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,114 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Includes $365 of LIFO expense for 2014 and $3,572 of LIFO income for 2013 (inclusive of a $1,932 out-of-period LIFO adjustment recorded in 2013).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> The non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the tubular and pipe prodcuts segment is seperately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $173 million, or 13.7%, to $1.44 billion in 2014 from $1.26 billion in 2013. Flat products net sales increased $165 million, or 16.1%, and were 83.0% of total net sales in 2014 compared to 81.3% in 2013. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $8 million, or 3.4%, and were 17.0% of total net sales in 2014 compared to 18.7% of total net sales in 2013. The increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a 13.3% increase in sales volume and a 0.3% increase in average selling prices in 2014 compared to 2013.\nCost of materials sold increased $161 million, or 16.1%, to $1.16 billion in 2014 from $999 million in 2013. During 2014, we recorded LIFO expense of $365 thousand compared to $3.6 million of LIFO income recorded in 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, we made an out-of-period adjustment to record previously unrecognized LIFO adjustments, which resulted in a 2013 decrease to cost of materials sold of $1.9 million. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2014 was primarily due to the increased sales volume of 13.3%, increased metals costs of 2.1% during 2014 and the impact of LIFO expense during 2014 compared to LIFO income in 2013.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 19.2% in 2014 from 20.9% in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in both segments. LIFO had no consolidated gross profit impact in 2014 and increased gross profit by 0.3% of net sales in 2013. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2014 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices in the flat rolled segment, as well as the impact of LIFO expense in 2014 compared to LIFO income in 2013.\nOperating expenses in 2014 increased $40.7 million, or 16.6%, from 2013. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 19.8% in 2014 from 19.3% in 2013. The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from a $23.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the tubular and pipe products segment. The goodwill impairment charge accounted for 58.6% of the operating expense increase. During 2014, distribution expense increased by $6.2 million, or 17.8%, due to the increased volume during 2014 as well as the inflationary dynamics in the transportation industry. Warehouse and processing costs increased $7.8 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to increased payroll and warehouse consumables expenses related to the 13.3% 2014 volume increase. Administrative costs increased by $3.7 million, or 5.4%, primarily related to employee travel, education and training, non-income taxes and one-time costs related to the CTI centennial celebration in 2014. Selling expenses decreased $0.1 million, or 0.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013 on a 13.7% sales increase as a result of decreased variable compensation associated with fewer sales employees and decreased discretionary spending, offset by $467 thousand of increased bad debt expense. Occupancy expense increased $657 thousand in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher utility and snow removal costs during the harsh winter in the first quarter of 2014. Depreciation expense decreased $1.5 million in 2014 as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in 2014.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $6.8 million in 2014 compared to $6.7 million in 2013. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.4% in 2014 compared to 2.3% in 2013. The increase in interest and other expense on debt in 2014 was primarily attributable to the fixed interest rate hedge and higher average borrowings, offset by lower rate premiums under our credit facility.\nFor 2014, loss before income taxes totaled $16.1 million compared to income before income taxes of $12.9 million in 2013. 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the tube and pipe segment and LIFO expense of $365 thousand. 2013 income before taxes included LIFO income of $3.6 million, inclusive of an out-of-period LIFO income adjustment of $1.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2013.\nAn income tax provision of (18.3%) was recorded for 2014, compared to an income tax provision of 40.8% in 2013. The 2014 effective income tax rate was unusual due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge for the tubular and pipe products segment. The income tax provision for 2014 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 38.2%.\nNet loss for 2014 totaled $19.1 million or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $7.6 million or $0.69 per basic and diluted share for 2013. The goodwill impairment impacted earnings per share by $2.14 per basic and diluted shares and the LIFO expense decreased earnings per share by $0.02 per basic and diluted share. The impact of LIFO income in 2013 increased earnings per share by $0.19 per basic and diluted shares. The out-of-period LIFO income adjustment accounted for $0.10 per basic and diluted share of the increase.\nSegment Results of Operations\nFlat products\nCommencing with the first quarter of 2015, the flat products segment has been separated into two reportable segments; carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products. The flat products segments' assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments' products are stored in the shared facilities and processed on the shared equipment. Separate carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products segment data is not available for 2013 due to system limitations. As a result, the carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products segments' 2014 results have been consolidated into the flat products segment in the discussion below. The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,132,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,007,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,239,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,088,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,191,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,026,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>986,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>834,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTons sold increased 13.8% to 1.24 million tons in 2014 from 1.09 million tons in 2013. The increase in tons sold was due to increased customer demand and increased market share. Toll tons sold increased 31.4% to 107 thousand tons in 2014 from 81 thousand tons in 2013. The increase in toll tons sold was due to a shift by some customers from direct sales to toll sales in 2014.\nNet sales increased $165 million, or 16.1%, to $1.19 billion in 2014 from $1.03 billion in 2013. Average selling prices in 2014 increased to $962 per ton, compared to $943 per ton in 2013. The increase in sales was due to a 13.8% increase in sales volume as well as a 2.0% increase in the average sell price during 2014.\nCost of materials sold increased $151.6 million, or 18.2%, to $986.6 million in 2014 from $835.0 million in 2013. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to the volume increase of 13.8% as well as a 3.8% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2014 compared to 2013.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 17.2% in 2014 from 18.7% in 2013. The decrease in gross profit percentage in 2014 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $166 in 2014 and $176 in 2013. The decrease in gross profit percentage in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the competitive market pressures associated with the growth in shipments and a higher mix of toll sales and lower gross margin percentage stainless and aluminum sales versus carbon sales.\nOperating expenses in 2014 increased $13.1 million, or 7.3%, from 2013. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 16.2% for 2014 from 17.5% in 2013. Freight and distribution expenses increased $5.3 million, or 20.2%, as a result of increased volume as well as the inflationary dynamics in the transportation industry. Warehouse and processing expenses increased $7.7 million, or 11.2%, as a result of higher sales volumes. Administrative and general expenses increased $1.7 million, or 4.1%, primarily as a result of increased compensation expenses. Depreciation decreased $1.8 million, or 10.8%, as a result of fully depreciated assets. Occupancy expenses increased as a result of higher utility and snow removal costs during the first quarter of 2014.\nOperating income for 2014 increased to $12.4 million, or 1.0% of net sales, from $12.1 million, or 1.2% of net sales in 2013.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2014 and 2013 (dollars shown in thousands).\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,651 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Includes $365 of LIFO expense in 2014 and $3,572 of LIFO income in 2013 (inclusive of a $1,932 out-of-period LIFO adjustment)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total cossts and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is seperately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $8.0 million, or 3.4%, to $244.5 million in 2014 from $236.6 million in 2013. The increase in net sales was due to a 6.2% increase in the sales volume offset by a 2.7% decrease in the average selling price during 2014.\nCost of materials sold increased $9.5 million, or 5.8%, to $173.8 million in 2014 from $164.2 million in 2013. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 6.2% increase in sales volume and the impact of LIFO expense of $365 thousand in 2014 compared to LIFO income of $3.6 million in 2013, offset by a decrease in the average cost of materials sold of 2.7%.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) totaled 28.9% in 2014 compared to 30.6%, in 2013. The LIFO expense recorded in 2014 decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales and the LIFO income recorded in 2013, increased gross profit by 1.5% of net sales, resulting in pre-LIFO gross margin as a percentage of net sales remaining constant at 29.1% in both 2014 and 2013.\nOperating expenses increased $27.1 million, or 47.2%, to $84.4 million, or 34.5% of net sales, in 2014 compared to $57.4 million, or 24.3%, of net sales in 2013. In 2014, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million. The impairment charge accounted for 88.0% of the operating expense increase. Distribution expense increased $913 thousand, or 10.5%, as a result of the increased sales volume as well as the inflationary dynamics in the transportation industry. Warehouse and processing expense increased $132 thousand, or 0.8%, on a 6.2% increase in sales volume. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased $1.7 million, or 6.5%, due to non-recurring costs related to CTI's Centennial events in 2014 and increased payroll costs. Depreciation expense increased $316 thousand, or 7.2%, as a result of the St. Paul facility expansion in 2013 and new processing equipment.\nOperating loss for 2014 totaled $13.7 million, or (5.6%) of net sales, compared to operating income of $15.0 million, or 6.3% of net sales, for 2013. The operating loss for 2014 was the result of the goodwill impairment of $23.8 million as well as LIFO expense of $365 thousand. Operating income for 2013 included LIFO income of $3.6 million.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $540 thousand, or 7.3%, to $8.0 million in 2014, compared to $7.4 million in 2013. The increase in Corporate expenses in 2014 is mainly attributable to a full year of office rent and increased professional fees and travel costs.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows\nOur principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations, leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements.\nWe believe that funds available under our credit facility, lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and share repurchases and any business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2015, we generated $107.5 million of cash from operations, of which $12.4 million was generated from operating activities and $95.1 million was generated from working capital. During 2014, we used $39.6 million of cash for operations, of which $25.4 million was generated from operating activities and $65.0 million was used for working capital.\nNet cash from operations totaled $12.4 million during 2015 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.9 million and the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of $25.0 million, offset by the net loss of $26.8 million. Net cash from operations totaled $25.4 million during 2014 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $21.8 million and the non-cash goodwill impairment of $23.8 million, offset by the net loss of $19.1 million.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2015 totaled $231.9 million, a $94.8 million decrease from December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $104.5 million decrease in inventory (resulting from decreased inventory purchases and lower metals cost in 2015 compared to 2014) and a $30.9 million decrease in accounts receivable (resulting from lower sales volume and selling prices), offset by a $35.6 million decrease in accounts payable and outstanding checks and a $18.5 million decrease in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other and accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities is mainly related to the decrease in metals derivatives.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities was $7.3 million during 2015, compared to $7.8 million during 2014. In 2015, capital expenditures were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment at our flat products (carbon and specialty metals) and tube and pipe products existing facilities. During 2016, we expect to limit our capital spending to less than our annual depreciation expense (approximately $18 million in 2016).\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2015, $100.8 million of cash was used for financing activities which primarily consisted of $98.3 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2014, $46.4 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $49.2 million of net borrowings under our credit facility, including the payoff of our term loan of $48.9 million upon refinancing and subsequent borrowings under our revolving credit facility, offset by $1.2 million of additional deferred financing fees incurred as part of the June 30, 2014 amendment to the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below).\nIn February 2016, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2016. Our Board previously approved 2015 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid on each of March 16, 2015, June 15, 2015, September 15, 2015 and December 15, 2015. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, the $2.5 million annual limitation on cash dividends under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn October 2, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Any of the repurchased shares will be held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $2.5 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $2.5 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 25% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($91.3 million at December 31, 2015) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($54.8 million at December 31, 2015) and we must maintain a pro-forma ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under the ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. During 2016, we expect to be limited to the $2.5 million available without restrictions to repurchase common stock and pay dividends.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 65,283 shares for a total cost of $699 thousand.\nDebt Arrangements\nOur ABL Credit Facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Credit Facility consists of a revolving credit line of $365 million. Revolver borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of eligible receivables and inventories, or $365 million in the aggregate. The ABL Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2019.\nThe ABL Credit Facility requires us to comply with various covenants, the most significant of which include: (i) until maturity of the ABL Credit Facility, if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($36.5 million at December 31, 2015) then we must maintain a ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period; (ii) limitations on dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (iii) restrictions on additional indebtedness. We have the option to borrow under our revolver based on the agent's base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 3.00%.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its covenants and had approximately $87.7 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $2.8 million of bank financing fees were included in Prepaid expenses and other\u201d and Other long-term assets\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit facility and are included in Interest and other expense on debt\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWe entered into a forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge that commenced June 2013, in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on $53.2 million of then outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The hedge matures on June 1, 2016 and the notional amount is reduced monthly by $729 thousand. The remaining hedged balance as of December 31, 2015 was $31.4 million. The interest rate hedge fixed the rate at 1.21% plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. Although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate hedge agreement, we anticipate performance by the counterparties.\nAs part of the CTI acquisition in July 2011, we assumed approximately $5.9 million of Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB) indebtedness issued through the Stanly County, North Carolina Industrial Revenue and Pollution Control Authority. The bond matures in April 2018, with the option to provide principal payments annually on April 1st. On April 1, 2015, we paid an optional principal payment of $840 thousand. Since the IRB is remarketed annually, it is included in Current portion of long-term debt\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest is payable monthly, with a variable rate that resets weekly. As a security for payment of the bonds, we obtained a direct pay letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The letter of credit reduces annually by the principal reduction amount. The interest rate at December 31, 2015 was 0.11% for the IRB debt.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2014, we used $39.6 million of cash from operations, of which $25.4 million was generated from operating activities and $65.0 million was used for working capital. During 2013, we generated $54.7 million of net cash from operations, of which $29.1 million was generated from operating activities and $25.5 million was generated from working capital.\nNet cash from operations totaled $25.4 million during 2014 and was primarily generated from depreciation and amortization of $21.8 million and the non-cash goodwill impairment of $23.8 million, offset by the net loss of $19.1 million. Net cash from operations totaled $29.1 million during 2013 and was primarily generated from net income of $7.6 million, and depreciation and amortization of $23.6 million.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2014 totaled $326.7 million, a $74.7 million increase from December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to a $24.7 million increase in inventory (a result of increased inventory tonnage related to increased sales), an $8.5 million increase in accounts receivable (a result of increased sales), a $34.8 million decrease in accounts payable (a result of less inventory purchases at the end of the year in 2014 compared to 2013), and a $7.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other, offset by a $10.7 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. The increase in prepaid expenses and other and accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities is mainly related to the increase in metals derivatives.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities was $7.8 million during 2014, compared to $16.1 million during 2013. In 2014, capital expenditures were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment at our flat products and tube and pipe products existing facilities.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2014, $46.4 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $49.2 million of net borrowings under our credit facility, including the payoff of our term loan of $48.9 million upon refinancing and subsequent borrowings under our revolving credit facility, offset by $1.2 million of additional deferred financing fees incurred as part of the June 30, 2014 amendment to the ABL Credit Facility.\nOur Board of Directors approved regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid on each of March 17, 2014, June 16, 2014, September 16, 2014 and December 15, 2014.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations\n</td> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax positions\n</td> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,631 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Future interest obligations are calculated using the debt balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased metals, inbound freight, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Costs of our flat product segment's inventories, including flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method.\nCertain of our tubular and pipe products inventory is stated under the LIFO method. At December 31, 2015, approximately $42.7 million, or 20.7% of consolidated inventory, was reported under the LIFO method of accounting. The cost of the remainder of CTI's inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first-in, first-out method.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill for the specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products segments and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the tubular and pipe products segment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for each of the Company's reporting units that carry goodwill.\nIf a quantitative fair value measurement is used, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. As described below, at December 31, 2015 all of the Company's goodwill has been impaired; accordingly, future goodwill impairment testing will no longer be required unless we make acquisitions in the future.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology, an income approach, and a publicly traded companies guideline method, a market approach. Management's assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results, projected financial information and recent economic events. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill.\nDuring 2015, the metals industry experienced a significant decline in the price of metals as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported materials arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals, and an oversupply of metals. The price of hot-rolled carbon steel decreased approximately 22%, or $130 per ton, during the first six months of 2015. As a result, the Company determined that a triggering event occurred in the Company's tubular and pipe products segment during the second quarter of 2015. The challenging market conditions negatively impacted the segment's financial performance and the decrease of the Company's market capitalization led the Company to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the tubular and pipe products segment with its carrying value. The Company engaged an independent third-party valuation expert to assist with the completion of the goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible asset impairment testing.\nThe asset impairment testing determined that the carrying value of the operations was in excess of the fair value and indefinitely lived intangible asset and goodwill impairments were identified. The Company concluded that the indefinitely lived intangible asset, Trade name, was partially impaired and the impairment in the amount of $8.0 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Based on the second step of the impairment test, the Company concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill for the tubular and pipe products segment was less than its carrying value and a full goodwill impairment of $16.5 million was recorded at June 30, 2015.\nThe metals industry continued to experience declining metals prices in the second half of 2015 as well as declining nickel prices. As a result, the Company concluded during its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2015 that the $500 thousand of goodwill related to the specialty metals flat products segment was fully impaired as the implied fair value of goodwill for specialty metals flat products segment was less than its carrying value.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. The Company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.\nDue to the impairment of the tubular and pipe products and specialty metals segments' goodwill, a triggering event occurred for the long-lived assets of the Company. We performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis that demonstrated there were no indicators of impairment of the long-lived assets of the Company. Additionally, the indefinite lived intangible asset was tested for impairment due to the triggering event. This test identified an impairment to the Company's intangible assets of $8.0 million, which was recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Based on the Company's analysis in the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no further impairments of the Company's long-lived assets in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred, which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers. Given the proximity of our customers to our facilities, substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nCertain engineered products produced by CTI can take several months to manufacture due to their size and complexity. Substantially all projects are completed within six months. The Company may request advance payments from customers during the production of these products. These payments are included in Other accrued liabilities\u201d on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to their short-term nature, the Company uses the units of delivery method to account for these contracts. Revenue for the contracts is recognized when the product is shipped and title of the product transfers to the customers. Revenues for these engineered products accounted for approximately 1.8%, 1.7% and 1.9% of our net sales during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\u201d This ASU is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce complexity in the presentation of deferred taxes. This new guidance eliminates the requirement for entities that present a classified statement of financial position to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead require that they classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. However, the guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. Companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The guidance may be applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively (i.e., by reclassifying the comparative balance sheet). If applied prospectively, entities are required to include a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If applied retrospectively, entities are also required to include quantitative information about the effects of the change on prior periods. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\u201d This ASU is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce the complexity in the presentation of debt issuance costs. This new guidance requires companies to present debt issuance costs the same way they currently present debt discounts, as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability. The guidance is limited to simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs and does not impact the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments of ASU No. 2015-03 must be applied retrospectively, where the balance sheet of each presented individual period is adjusted to indicate the period-specific impact of using the new guidance. The FASB considered that because both debt issuance costs and debt discounts are amortized using the effective interest method, there would be no effect on the income statement upon adoption of the amendments. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance requires management to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures under certain circumstances. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d This ASU is a joint project initiated by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards that will: remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. As originally proposed, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from contracts with customers.\u201d This ASU deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a company involved in metals processing and distribution services.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments' results.\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; energy prices; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, and inventory held in the supply chain; customers' ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers' or our customers' personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.\nLike other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have entered into nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company now operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. Commencing with the first quarter of 2015, the flat products segment has been separated into two reportable segments; carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products. The flat products segments' assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments' products are stored in the shared facilities and processed on the shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology. The financial information for 2014 has been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure. The financial information for 2013 has not been recast due to system limitations and the carbon and specialty metals flat products segment financial information is reported consolidated.\nWe follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach\u201d to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.\nCarbon flat products\nThe primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCombined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 23 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe tubular and pipe products segment consists of the CTI business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including payroll expenses for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\nDue to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments' average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.\nDue to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales impacts total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the last-in, first-out, or LIFO, method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.\nResults of Operations\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe metals industry experienced a significant decline in the price of metals during 2015 as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported materials arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals and a global oversupply of metals. The price of hot-rolled carbon flat steel decreased approximately 41% during 2015. Similarly, the price of stainless steel and aluminum decreased during 2015. The declines in metals shipments and pricing have negatively impacted our 2015 sales and earnings. Industry demand has also softened in 2015 compared to 2014 as evidenced by lower year over year shipments by metals service centers in the United States. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge in our tubular and pipe products segment as a result of the continued decline in metals pricing and its impact on the tubular and pipe products segment results. The impairment charge consisted of a $16.5 million goodwill impairment, which eliminated the remaining goodwill in the tubular and pipe products segment, and a partial impairment of $8.0 million related to the segment's tradename. The tradename is an indefinitely lived intangible asset with a remaining value of $15.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $500 thousand impairment charge, which fully eliminated the goodwill in our specialty metals flat products segment.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands):\n\n (a) Includes $3,347 of LIFO income for 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense for 2014. \n (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment shown seperately below for comparability purposes. \n (d) The non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge is seperately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. $24,451 in 2015 and $23,836 in 2014 of the impairment charge is related to the tubular and pipe products segment and $500 in 2015 is related to the specialty metals flat products segment. \nNet sales decreased $261 million, or 18.2%, to $1.18 billion in 2015 from $1.44 billion in 2014. Carbon flat products net sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, and were 65.1% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 68.6% in 2014. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, and were 16.4% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 14.4% in 2014. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, and were 18.5% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 17.0% of total net sales in 2014. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a 10.2% decrease in sales volume and an 8.9% decrease in average selling prices in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCost of materials sold decreased $218 million, or 18.8%, to $942 million in 2015 from $1.16 billion in 2014. During 2015, we recorded LIFO income of $3.3 million compared to LIFO expense of $365 thousand recorded in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 is primarily due to the decreased sales volume of 10.2%, decreased metals costs of 9.6% during 2015 and the impact of LIFO income during 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 19.8% in 2015 from 19.2% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 19.2% from 18.2% in 2014 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.5% from 28.9% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. LIFO increased gross profit by 0.3% of net sales in 2015 and had no consolidated gross profit impact in 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in the carbon flat rolled and tubular and pipe products segments, as well as the impact of LIFO income in 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $25.2 million, or 9.6%, to $236.2 million in 2015 from $261.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% in 2015 from 18.1% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased in all categories as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During 2015, we executed on our profit improvement plan, which contributed to the cost reductions. Distribution expense decreased by $5.2 million, or 12.7%, due to the decreased sales volume. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $6.8 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and reduced warehouse consumables expenses related to the 10.2% 2015 volume decrease. Administrative costs decreased by $7.2 million, or 10.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses, centralization of certain administrative functions, lower variable based incentive compensation and decreases in travel and entertainment expenses. Selling expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 14.7%, as a result of decreased variable compensation associated with fewer sales employees and decreased discretionary spending. Occupancy expenses decreased $560 thousand as a result of decreased heating and snow removal expenses. Depreciation expense decreased $1.7 million, or 8.8%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2014. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $19.0 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment decreased $2.4 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $1.8 million, and Corporate expenses decreased $0.9 million.\nThe goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 includes a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $500 thousand goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2014 included a $23.8 million goodwill impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $5.7 million in 2015 compared to $6.8 million in 2014. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.1% in 2015 compared to 2.4% in 2014. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average borrowing rates during 2015 compared to 2014.\nFor 2015, loss before income taxes totaled $33.6 million compared to loss before income taxes of $16.1 million in 2014. 2015 includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge and LIFO income of $3.3 million. 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the tube and pipe segment and LIFO expense of $365 thousand.\nAn income tax benefit of 20.3% was recorded for 2015, compared to an income tax provision of (18.3%) in 2013. The 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates were impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%. The income tax provision for 2014 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 38.2%. We expect our 2016 income tax rate to approximate 38% to 40%.\nNet loss for 2015 totaled $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $19.1 million, or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, for 2014. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares. The goodwill impairment in 2014 impacted earnings per basic and diluted shares by $2.14.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\n\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. \nTons sold decreased 11.0% to 1.04 million tons in 2015 from 1.17 million tons in 2014. Toll tons sold decreased 4.1% to 102 thousand tons in 2015 from 107 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments of carbon flat products in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, to $765.4 million in 2015 from $985.0 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased 12.7% to $738 per ton, compared to $845 per ton in 2013. The decrease in sales was due to an 11.0% decrease in sales volume and a 12.7% decrease in average selling prices during 2015. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of declining prices in the metals industry during 2015 discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect market carbon flat metals prices in the first quarter of 2016 to increase slightly over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCost of materials sold decreased $187.1 million, or 23.2%, to $618.7 million in 2015 from $805.7 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 11.0% as well as a 13.7% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 19.2% in 2015 from 18.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $141 in 2015 from $154 in 2014 due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2015.\nOperating expenses in 2015 decreased $19.0 million, or 11.0%, to $153.9 million from $173.0 million in 2014 mirroring the sales volume decrease of 11.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% for 2015 from 17.6% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, decreases in travel and entertainment expenses, and lower distribution expense as a result of lower sales volumes.\nOperating loss for 2015 totaled $7.2 million compared to operating income of $6.3 million in 2014.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\n\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill impairment charge shown separately below for comparability purposes. \n (c) The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. \nTons sold decreased 1.2% to 72 thousand tons in 2015 from 73 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry wide shipments of stainless and aluminum flat products.\nNet sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, to $192.5 million in 2015 from $206.7 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased to $2,671 per ton, compared to $2,833 per ton in 2014. The decrease in sales was due to a 1.2% decrease in sales volume and a 5.7% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in the year over year average selling price per ton is a result of declining market price of nickel and aluminum, which continue to pressure stainless and aluminum pricing. We expect market stainless and aluminum prices in the first quarter of 2016 to continue to be pressured.\nCost of materials sold decreased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, to $176.7 million in 2015 from $180.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 1.2% and a 1.1% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a)", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The impairment charge consisted of a $16.5 million goodwill impairment, which eliminated the remaining goodwill in the tubular and pipe products segment, and a partial impairment of $8.0 million related to the segment's tradename. The tradename is an indefinitely lived intangible asset with a remaining value of $15.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $500 thousand impairment charge, which fully eliminated the goodwill in our specialty metals flat products segment.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,175,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,436,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>942,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,779 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,208 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,594 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,114 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,817 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,777 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes $3,347 of LIFO income for 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense for 2014. \n (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

Carbon flat products net sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, and were 65.1% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 68.6% in 2014. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, and were 16.4% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 14.4% in 2014. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, and were 18.5% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 17.0% of total net sales in 2014. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a 10.2% decrease in sales volume and an 8.9% decrease in average selling prices in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCost of materials sold decreased $218 million, or 18.8%, to $942 million in 2015 from $1.16 billion in 2014. During 2015, we recorded LIFO income of $3.3 million compared to LIFO expense of $365 thousand recorded in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 is primarily due to the decreased sales volume of 10.2%, decreased metals costs of 9.6% during 2015 and the impact of LIFO income during 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 19.8% in 2015 from 19.2% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 19.2% from 18.2% in 2014 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.5% from 28.9% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. LIFO increased gross profit by 0.3% of net sales in 2015 and had no consolidated gross profit impact in 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in the carbon flat rolled and tubular and pipe products segments, as well as the impact of LIFO income in 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $25.2 million, or 9.6%, to $236.2 million in 2015 from $261.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% in 2015 from 18.1% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased in all categories as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During 2015, we executed on our profit improvement plan, which contributed to the cost reductions. Distribution expense decreased by $5.2 million, or 12.7%, due to the decreased sales volume. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $6.8 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and reduced warehouse consumables expenses related to the 10.2% 2015 volume decrease. Administrative costs decreased by $7.2 million, or 10.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses, centralization of certain administrative functions, lower variable based incentive compensation and decreases in travel and entertainment expenses. Selling expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 14.7%, as a result of decreased variable compensation associated with fewer sales employees and decreased discretionary spending. Occupancy expenses decreased $560 thousand as a result of decreased heating and snow removal expenses. Depreciation expense decreased $1.7 million, or 8.8%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2014. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $19.0 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment decreased $2.4 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $1.8 million, and Corporate expenses decreased $0.9 million.\nThe goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 includes a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $500 thousand goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2014 included a $23.8 million goodwill impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $5.7 million in 2015 compared to $6.8 million in 2014. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.1% in 2015 compared to 2.4% in 2014. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average borrowing rates during 2015 compared to 2014.\nFor 2015, loss before income taxes totaled $33.6 million compared to loss before income taxes of $16.1 million in 2014. 2015 includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge and LIFO income of $3.3 million. 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the tube and pipe segment and LIFO expense of $365 thousand.\nAn income tax benefit of 20.3% was recorded for 2015, compared to an income tax provision of (18.3%) in 2013. The 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates were impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%. The income tax provision for 2014 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 38.2%. We expect our 2016 income tax rate to approximate 38% to 40%.\nNet loss for 2015 totaled $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $19.1 million, or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, for 2014. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares. The goodwill impairment in 2014 impacted earnings per basic and diluted shares by $2.14.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,037,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,166,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>765,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>985,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>618,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,217 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. \nTons sold decreased 11.0% to 1.04 million tons in 2015 from 1.17 million tons in 2014. Toll tons sold decreased 4.1% to 102 thousand tons in 2015 from 107 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments of carbon flat products in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, to $765.4 million in 2015 from $985.0 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased 12.7% to $738 per ton, compared to $845 per ton in 2013. The decrease in sales was due to an 11.0% decrease in sales volume and a 12.7% decrease in average selling prices during 2015. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of declining prices in the metals industry during 2015 discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect market carbon flat metals prices in the first quarter of 2016 to increase slightly over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCost of materials sold decreased $187.1 million, or 23.2%, to $618.7 million in 2015 from $805.7 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 11.0% as well as a 13.7% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 19.2% in 2015 from 18.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $141 in 2015 from $154 in 2014 due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2015.\nOperating expenses in 2015 decreased $19.0 million, or 11.0%, to $153.9 million from $173.0 million in 2014 mirroring the sales volume decrease of 11.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% for 2015 from 17.6% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, decreases in travel and entertainment expenses, and lower distribution expense as a result of lower sales volumes.\nOperating loss for 2015 totaled $7.2 million compared to operating income of $6.3 million in 2014.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,574 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. \n (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry wide shipments of stainless and aluminum flat products.\nNet sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, to $192.5 million in 2015 from $206.7 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased to $2,671 per ton, compared to $2,833 per ton in 2014. The decrease in sales was due to a 1.2% decrease in sales volume and a 5.7% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in the year over year average selling price per ton is a result of declining market price of nickel and aluminum, which continue to pressure stainless and aluminum pricing. We expect market stainless and aluminum prices in the first quarter of 2016 to continue to be pressured.\nCost of materials sold decreased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, to $176.7 million in 2015 from $180.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 1.2% and a 1.1% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a)"}
