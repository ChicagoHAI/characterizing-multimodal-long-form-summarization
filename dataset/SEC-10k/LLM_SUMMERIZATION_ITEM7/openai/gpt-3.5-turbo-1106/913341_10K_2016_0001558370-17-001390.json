We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.\nThe following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: We establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs for relevant periods of time, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower's ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. For more information, see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nAllowance for Indemnifications: The allowance for indemnifications is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for indemnifications, which is included in other noninterest expenses. A loss is charged against the allowance for indemnifications when a purchaser of a loan (investor) sold by C&F Mortgage incurs a validated indemnified loss due to borrower misrepresentation, fraud, early default, or underwriting error. The allowance represents an amount that, in management's judgment, will be adequate to absorb any losses arising from valid indemnification requests. Management's judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on the volume of loans sold, historical experience, current economic conditions and information provided by investors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Loans: We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. We do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due. We measure impairment on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial, construction and residential loans in excess of $500,000 by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment. Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are also considered impaired loans, even when the loan balance is less than $500,000. A TDR occurs when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. For more information see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination: Loans acquired in the acquisition of CVBK and its subsidiary CVB were segregated between (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and (ii) purchased performing loans and were recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition without the carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Corporation will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans were aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference,\u201d is not recorded and is available to absorb future credit losses on those loans. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable\u201d yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nSubsequent to acquisition, we evaluate on a quarterly basis our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Corporation's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of CVB. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming by CVB are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at quarterly re-estimation periods, we believe we will fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Corporation accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. Because there is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date, a provision for loan losses may be required in future periods for any deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nImpairment of Securities: Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nvalue. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO): Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Corporation may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nGoodwill: The Corporation's goodwill was recognized in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of CVBK in October 2013 and C&F Bank's acquisition of C&F Finance Company in September 2002. The Corporation reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. In assessing the recoverability of the Corporation's goodwill, major assumptions used in determining impairment are increases in future income, sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. If an impairment test is performed, we will prepare a sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate, lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income.\nRetirement Plan: C&F Bank maintains a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. C&F Bank's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may affect pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: The Corporation uses derivatives primarily to manage risk associated with changing interest rates and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. The Corporation's derivative financial instruments may include (1) interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on mortgage loans that will be held for sale and related forward sales commitments, (2) interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties and (3) interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes. The Corporation recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Because the IRLCs, forward sales commitments and interest rate swaps with loan customers and dealer counterparties are classified as free standing derivatives, adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these instruments are reported in the income statement. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the Corporation's cash flow hedges is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.\nIncome Taxes: Determining the Corporation's effective tax rate requires judgment. The Corporation's net deferred tax asset is determined annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. In addition, there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain and the Corporation's tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual.\nFor further information concerning accounting policies, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary financial goals are to maximize the Corporation's earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals: (i) return on average assets (ROA), (ii) return on average common equity (ROE), and (iii) growth in earnings. In addition to these financial performance measures, we track the performance of the Corporation's three principal business activities: retail banking, mortgage banking, and consumer finance. We also actively manage our capital through growth, dividends and share repurchases, while considering the need to maintain a strong regulatory capital position.\nFinancial Performance Measures\nNet income for the Corporation was $13.5 million in 2016, or $3.89 per common share assuming dilution, compared with net income of $12.5 million in 2015, or $3.68 per common share assuming dilution. The change in financial results for 2016, as compared to 2015, was attributable to increases in earnings at the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments, offset in part by decreases in earnings at the Consumer Finance segment and the Bank's wealth management subsidiary. See Principal Business Activities\u201d below for additional discussion.\nThe Corporation's ROE and ROA were 9.90 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 9.87 percent and 0.92 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in these ratios during 2016 resulted primarily from earnings growth, which outpaced the growth in average equity and average assets. Average equity increased due to internal capital growth and average assets increased primarily due to the 10.0 percent increase in average loans.\n2017 Outlook\nManagement believes the Corporation's financial performance in 2017 will be affected by (i) lower accretion income related to the fair value accounting adjustments for the CVBK acquisition, partially offset by an increase in interest income from growth in average loans outstanding, (ii) an uncertain interest rate environment and potential fluctuations in interest rates that may depress loan production levels in the Mortgage Banking segment, and (iii) continued elevated charge-off levels and competition in the Consumer Finance segment. The following additional factors could influence the Corporation's financial performance in 2017:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRetail Banking: Growth in higher-yielding earning assets, specifically loans, will be our primary focus at the Bank during 2017. With commercial and small business lending teams already in our targeted markets in Charlottesville, Hampton, Newport News, Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia and the continued resurgence in the real estate development and construction sectors in our markets, we expect to continue to grow our loan portfolio during 2017. However, the general economic trends in the Bank's markets and the current low interest rate environment have contributed to increased competition and lower yields on both the loan and investment portfolios. It will be challenging to maintain the Retail Banking segment's net interest margin at its current level as the net accretion of the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the CVB acquisition decline and as the recent increase in the federal funds rate provides stimulus for higher-costing deposits. Also in 2017, we will continue to focus on our digital strategy because online and mobile access are quickly becoming the primary means of banking for many businesses and individuals, and we believe our digital strategy commitment is critical to remaining competitive within the financial services industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMortgage Banking: C&F Mortgage generates significant noninterest income from the sale of residential loan products into the secondary market. Although earnings increased at the Mortgage Banking segment in 2016, compared to 2015, increasing future profitability at the current origination levels will be challenging due to the fixed costs of maintaining the personnel, compliance and technology infrastructure required to support mortgage banking activities. While our goal is to increase origination volume through internal growth in existing markets and through strategic initiatives, such as our recent expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and Moyock, North Carolina, our ability to maintain a level of loan production in 2017 sufficient to sustain profitability will be dependent on market factors beyond our control, such as the interest rate environment and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>changes in interest rates, housing starts and loan demand. If mortgage interest rates continue to rise during 2017, C&F Mortgage may experience a lower loan demand, particularly for mortgage refinancings, which could negatively affect earnings of the Mortgage Banking segment in 2017. In addition, during 2017 C&F Mortgage anticipates it will continue to (i) compete to retain and attract qualified loan officers, (ii) incur costs associated with updating and enhancing our compliance management system and processes for originating residential loans to mitigate compliance and regulatory risks, as well as improving the quality of our loan origination process and (iii) utilize systems to their fullest capacity in order to realize efficiencies overall in our mortgage banking processes and to create opportunities for revenue generation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsumer Finance: C&F Finance provides automobile financing through programs that are designed to serve customers in the non-prime market. As has been the case for the last several years, competition in the non-prime automobile loan business remains aggressive, resulting in lower interest rates and in many cases, less restrictive underwriting standards by several of our competitors. As a result, organic loan growth was difficult during 2016, and we expect organic loan growth to be equally as challenging in 2017. However, C&F Finance implemented strategic initiatives in 2016 to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition. During 2016, C&F Finance implemented a scorecard model that improved underwriting and pricing efficiencies and contributed to loan growth. We expect this model, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, will lead to loan growth in 2017. Further, we believe our scorecard model, which results in the purchase of loans with higher credit metrics, should help reduce future charge-offs at C&F Finance. However, we believe it will be challenging to maintain the Consumer Finance segment's net interest margin at its current level as competition in the non-prime market causes yields to decline and the recent increase in the federal funds rate triggers higher-costing variable-rate borrowings. During 2017, we expect to continue investing in technology at C&F Finance in order to capture more business, improve efficiencies, and manage the rigorous regulatory burdens and evolving compliance issues in the indirect auto lending industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal Business Activities\nAn overview of the financial results for each of the Corporation's principal segments is presented below. A more detailed discussion is included in the section Results of Operations.\u201d\nRetail Banking: The Retail Banking segment reported net income of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income for 2016 was positively influenced by (1) the effect of loan growth on interest income, as average loans at the Retail Banking segment increased $72.9 million or 12.6 percent during 2016 over 2015, (2) an increase in non-interest income due to fees collected on loans closed under a new loan interest rate swap program initiated in 2016, (3) an increase in debit card interchange income, and (4) a lower cost of borrowings resulting from the maturity and restructuring of the Bank's higher-rate FHLB advances. Also contributing to the increase in earnings during 2016 were one-time revenue items in the second quarter of 2016 associated with a contract amendment for one of the Bank's debit card programs ($237,000 after tax), the Bank's bank-owned life insurance program ($493,000 after tax) and a gain on the sale of a Bank-owned property ($92,000 after tax). Partially offsetting these positive factors were (1) a decline in the yield on the investment portfolio due to replacing matured and called securities with lower-yielding securities, (2) a decline in the yield on loans due to the effects of the low interest rate and competitive loan environment, and (3) higher operating expenses associated with strengthening C&F Bank's technology infrastructure, growing its commercial lending teams, expanding its product offerings and promoting brand awareness.\nThe results for both 2016 and 2015 for the Retail Banking segment have been affected by the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of CVB. These adjustments resulted from marking assets and liabilities acquired from CVB to their fair values as of the acquisition date. As a result, yields on loans and investments acquired from CVB increased and the cost of certificates of deposit decreased, the benefits of which were partially offset by the (1) amortization of the core deposit intangible and (2) higher depreciation expense associated with the buildings acquired in the CVB merger. The aggregate net accretion attributable to these fair value accounting adjustments was $1.2 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.3 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Retail Banking segment's nonperforming assets were $4.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016 included $4.2 million in nonaccrual loans, compared to $6.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $195,000 in OREO, compared to $942,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2016 was primarily due to loan payoffs and transfers to OREO. The OREO decrease during 2016 was primarily due to the sale of several OREO properties and a shorter holding period for properties transferred to OREO during 2016. Management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, based on the relevant history of charge-offs and recoveries, current economic conditions, overall portfolio quality, review of specific criticized loans and other factors analyzed by management. If loan concentrations within the Bank's loan portfolio result in higher credit risk or if economic conditions decline, a higher loan loss allowance may be warranted in future periods, which may require a provision for loan losses.\nMortgage Banking: The Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The improvement in net income of the Mortgage Banking segment for 2016 resulted from an increase in the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold during 2016, compared to 2015. Loan volume increased due to successful strategic initiatives and benefited from favorable housing markets for both resale and new construction, as well as favorable interest rates. The higher loan volume resulted in higher gains on sales of loans and higher ancillary loan origination fees. These revenue increases were partially offset by higher employee compensation and loan production expenses, as well as costs associated with the mortgage banking segment's expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $674.3 million from $549.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amount of loan originations during 2016 for refinancings and home purchases were $152.7 million and $521.6 million, respectively, compared to $104.4 million and $444.9 million, respectively, during 2015.\nConsumer Finance: The Consumer Finance segment reported net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in net income for 2016, compared to 2015, was principally due to an increase in the provision for loan losses from $15.5 million in 2015 to $18.0 million in 2016 because of higher net charge-offs, as discussed below, and loan growth. Partially offsetting the effect of the higher provision for loan losses was the effect on net interest income of the $13.7 million increase in average loans during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in average loans was attributable to the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2015, along with organic loan growth during 2016. C&F Finance has implemented a scorecard model that is providing underwriting efficiencies and generating more competitive pricing, which, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, led to an increase in loan originations during 2016.\nThe results of the Consumer Finance segment included an increase of $2.6 million in the provision for loan losses from 2015 to 2016. The net charge-off ratio for 2016 was 5.59 percent, compared to 5.50 percent for 2015. Loans charged off increased during 2016 because of economic and competitive factors affecting non-prime consumer finance customers. The allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to 8.40 percent at December 31, 2016, compared to 8.21 percent at December 31, 2015. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. If factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in a higher net charge-off ratio in the future, C&F Finance Company may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses, which could negatively affect future earnings.\nOther and Eliminations: The other segment, which principally includes the Corporation's holding company operations and wealth management subsidiary, reported an aggregate net loss of $975,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $955,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss during 2016 was due to lower earnings at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary due to stock market volatility during 2016, as well as costs associated with the wealth management subsidiary's addition of a new wealth management group in Williamsburg, Virginia. We expect the addition of this wealth management group will increase revenue in future periods. Other segments also included a $229,000 and $163,000 tax benefit during the year and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively, associated with the adoption of a new accounting standard.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCapital Management\nTotal shareholders' equity was $139.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $131.1 million at December 31, 2015. Capital growth resulted from earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 and stock option exercises, offset in part by dividends during the year.\nThe Corporation's Board of Directors continued its policy of paying dividends in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Corporation declared dividends of $1.29 per share, which was a six percent increase over dividends of $1.22 per share declared in 2015. The dividend payout ratio was 33.1 percent of basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 33.2 percent in 2015. The Board of Directors of the Corporation continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, capital levels, expected future earnings, and regulatory capital requirements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation's Board of Directors reauthorized a share repurchase program for the Corporation's outstanding common stock (the Repurchase Program) to purchase up to $5.0 million of the Corporation's common stock through May 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had not used any of this authority and remained authorized to purchase up to $5.0 million of the Corporation's common stock under the Repurchase Program.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation qualified for inclusion in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index, which serves as a benchmark for small-cap stocks in the United States. Management believes that inclusion in the Russell 2000\u00ae has the potential to raise the Corporation's profile and generate greater interest in the Corporation's stock at an institutional investor level.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nThe following table shows the average balance sheets, the amounts of interest earned on earning assets, with related yields, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, with related rates, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Loans include loans held for sale. Loans placed on a nonaccrual status are included in the balances and are included in the computation of yields, but had no material effect. Accretion and amortization of fair value purchase adjustments are included in the computation of yields on loans and investments and on the cost of deposits and borrowings acquired in connection with the purchase of CVB. The CVB accretion contributed approximately 24 basis points to the yield on loans and 17 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to approximately 25 basis points to the yield on loans and 18 basis points to both the yield on interest earning assets and the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately 32 basis points to the yield on loans, 22 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and 23 basis points to the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest on tax-exempt loans and securities is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis (which converts the income on loans and investments for which no income taxes are paid to the equivalent yield as if income taxes were paid using the federal corporate income tax rate of 34 percent in all three years presented).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTABLE 1: Average Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates\nTable

The following table shows the direct causes of the year-to-year changes in the components of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. The Corporation calculates the rate and volume variances using a formula prescribed by the SEC. Rate/volume variances, the third element in the calculation, are not shown separately in the table, but are allocated to the rate and volume variances in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Loans include both nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTABLE 2: Rate-Volume Recap\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

$82.5 million, compared to $80.6 million for 2015. The increase in net interest income for 2016, compared to 2015, was a result of an increase in average earning assets, offset in part by a decrease in net interest margin. The net interest margin for 2016 decreased five basis points to 6.30 percent, compared to 6.35 percent for 2015. The decrease resulted from a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets of six basis points, which was primarily attributable to decreases in the yields on the loan and investment securities portfolios, which was somewhat offset by a shift in the composition of earning assets as growth in the higher-yielding loan portfolio was funded in part by a decline in lower-yielding deposits in other banks. While the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2016 increased two basis points, deposits continued to shift from higher-cost term deposits to lower-cost non-term deposits, as described below.\nAverage loans, which includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, increased $89.2 million to $994.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. Average loans held for sale increased $2.6 million, or 6.2 percent, during 2016, compared to 2015, due to a 22.8 percent increase in loan originations at the Mortgage Banking segment from 2015 to 2016 and fluctuations in the holding period between mortgage loan origination and sales to third-party investors. Average loans held for investment for the Retail Banking segment increased $72.9 million, or 12.6 percent, during 2016 because of growth in the commercial real estate, real estate mortgage and real estate construction segments of the loan portfolio, which was driven by investing in experienced commercial lending personnel over the past several years and the continued strong loan demand in the real estate development and construction sectors in our markets. Average loans held for investment at the Consumer Finance segment increased $13.7 million, or 4.8 percent, during 2016 because of the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio at the end the second quarter of 2015, along with organic loan growth during 2016.\nThe overall yield on average loans decreased 50 basis points to 8.35 percent during 2016, compared to 2015. The decrease in the average loan yield was due to (1) loan growth at the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments, which have lower average yields, outpacing growth in higher-yielding loans at the Consumer Finance segment and (2) the decline in the average yield on loans at the Retail Banking and Consumer Finance segments. The Bank's average yields\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nhave declined due to the effects of the low interest rate and competitive environment on new originations and renewals. In addition, the yield on loans at the Retail Banking segment included the net accretion attributable to the acquisition accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of CVB. The accretion contributed approximately 24 basis points to the yield on loans and 17 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for 2016, compared to approximately 25 basis points to the yield on loans and 18 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for 2015. The Consumer Finance segment's yield has been negatively affected by the continued competitive pressure during 2016 on loan pricing strategies and a strategic decision to purchase loans with higher credit quality metrics, but lower yields.\nAverage securities available for sale decreased $6.5 million during 2016, compared to 2015, because securities maturities, sales and calls outpaced purchases of investment securities. The average yield on the securities portfolio decreased due to the (1) purchase of lower-yielding shorter-term securities to replace maturities and calls of longer-term, higher yielding securities and (2) the current interest rate environment. The Corporation continued its strategy of investing in lower-yielding, shorter-term securities, including mortgage-backed securities, to limit exposure to a potential future rising interest rate environment by limiting the security portfolio's duration.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits in other banks, consisting primarily of excess reserves maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $41.3 million during 2016, compared to 2015, because the Corporation used these funds to partially fund loan growth during 2016. The average yield on these overnight funds increased 23 basis points during 2016 because of the Federal Reserve Bank's increase in the interest rate on excess reserve balances from 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent in December 2015. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank once again raised the interest rate from 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, which had a minimal effect on average yields during 2016.\nAverage interest-bearing time and savings deposits and average demand deposits increased $10.7 million and $24.7 million, respectively, during 2016, compared to 2015. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased one basis point during 2016. The increase in the cost of jumbo certificates of deposit during 2016, compared to 2015, was due to the accretion in 2015 of the CVB fair value accounting adjustment, which lowered the cost of jumbo certificates of deposit during that year. This acquisition adjustment was fully accreted in the second quarter of 2015 and had no effect on the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during 2016. However, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during 2016 benefited from a shift in composition from time deposits to non-term savings, money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, which pay lower interest rates.\nAverage borrowings decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. The decrease resulted from the repayment during 2016 of the borrowings used to purchase a consumer finance loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2015. The average cost of borrowings increased eight basis points during 2016, compared to 2015, because of increases in one-month LIBOR to which variable-rate borrowing at the Consumer Finance segment is indexed, which was offset in part by a lower cost of borrowings at the Bank resulting from the maturity and restructuring of higher-rate FHLB advances.\nIt will be challenging to maintain the Retail Banking segment's net interest margin at its current level, even with anticipated loan growth during 2017, because the current low interest rate environment has contributed to lower yields on both the loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the recent increase in the federal funds rate may provide stimulus for higher-costing deposits, which reprice faster than loans and investments when interest rates rise. The net interest margin at the Consumer Finance segment will be most affected by continued market competition and lower yields on higher-quality loans and the recent increase in the federal funds rate triggering higher-costing variable-rate borrowings.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $80.6 million, compared to $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net interest income for 2015, compared to 2014, was a result of an increase in average earning assets, offset in part by a decrease in net interest margin. Net interest margin decreased 20 basis points to 6.35 percent for 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease resulted from a decline in the yield on interest-earning assets of 20 basis points, which was primarily attributable to decreases in the yields on the loan and investment securities portfolios, as described below. While the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2015 remained\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlevel with 2014, deposits continued to shift from higher-cost term deposits to lower-cost deposits, including interest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts and noninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nAverage loans, which includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, increased $50.7 million to $905.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. Average loans held for sale increased $12.2 million, or 42.1 percent, during 2015, compared to 2014, due to a 14.8 percent increase in loan originations from 2014 to 2015 and fluctuations in the period of time between mortgage loan origination and sales to third-party investors. Average loans held for investment for the Retail Banking segment increased $37.1 million, or 7.0 percent, for 2015 due to growth in commercial real estate lending, commercial business lending and real estate mortgage segments of the loan portfolio, which was driven by investing in experienced commercial lending personnel and the resurgence in the real estate development and construction sectors in our markets. Average loans held for investment at the Consumer Finance segment increased $705,000, or 0.25 percent, for 2015 due to the purchase of a loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2015, which was acquired to improve interest income in light of the lack of internally generated loan growth.\nThe overall yield on average loans decreased 42 basis points to 8.85 percent for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease in the average loan yield is due to the decline in the average yield at both the Retail Banking and Consumer Finance segments. At the Retail Banking segment the decrease in yield is the result of the effects of the low interest rate environment, coupled with a decline in the net accretion attributable to fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of CVB. The accretion contributed approximately 25 basis points to the yield on loans and 18 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and net interest margin for 2015 compared to approximately 32 basis points to the yield on loans, 22 basis points to the yield on interest earning assets and 23 basis points to the net interest margin for 2014. At the Consumer Finance segment, the decrease in yield is the result of increased competition and loan pricing strategies that competitors have used to grow market share. Partially offsetting the decrease in the yield is the incremental interest income from the Consumer Finance segment's higher-yielding acquired loan portfolio that was purchased in the second quarter of 2015.\nAverage securities available for sale increased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. The average yield on the securities portfolio decreased due to the (1) purchase of lower-yielding shorter-term securities to replace maturities and calls of longer-term, higher yielding securities and (2) the current interest rate environment. The Corporation has utilized the strategy of investing in lower-yielding, shorter-term securities, including mortgage-backed securities, to limit exposure to a potential future rising interest rate environment by limiting the security portfolio's duration.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits in other banks, consisting primarily of excess reserves maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, and federal funds sold decreased $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014. These decreases occurred as the Corporation used these funds to partially fund loan growth during 2015. The average yield on these overnight funds increased one basis point during 2015. Effective December 17, 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank increased the interest rate on excess reserve balances from 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, which had a minimal effect on yield for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAverage interest-bearing time and savings deposits increased $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 1 basis point during 2015. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits benefited from the shift in deposit composition from time deposits to non-term savings, money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, which pay lower interest rates. However, the rate on other certificates of deposit increased 14 basis points in 2015 over 2014 primarily due to only a partial year of CVB purchase accretion during 2015. The fair value adjustment on the CVB certificates of deposit was fully accreted during the second quarter of 2015. Time deposit accretion related to the accounting adjustment to the CVB time deposits reduced cost by 4 basis points 2015, compared to 13 basis points in 2014.\nAverage borrowings increased $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014. This increase resulted from borrowings related to the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2015. The average cost of borrowings declined one basis point during 2015, as a result of the maturity of higher interest rate FHLB advances, which were replaced with lower rate FHLB advances.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nTABLE 3: Noninterest Income\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

same period in 2015. The increase in total noninterest income for 2016 was attributable to (1) a higher volume of loans originated and sold during 2016 at the Mortgage Banking segment, which resulted in higher gains on sales of loans and ancillary loan origination fees, (2) higher debit card interchange income at the Retail Banking segment, and (3) swap fee income at the Retail Banking segment related to the new interest rate swap program initiated in 2016. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest income during 2016 were one-time revenue items at the Retail Banking segment in the second quarter of 2016 associated with a contract amendment for one of the Bank's debit card programs ($237,000 after tax), the Bank's BOLI program ($493,000 after tax) and a gain on the sale of a Bank-owned property ($92,000 after tax). Other income for both the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments increased due to the inclusion of net unrealized\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nappreciation in noninterest income related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2016, compared to net depreciation recognized in noninterest expense during 2015. These increases were partially offset by (1) declines in overdraft fees at the Retail Banking segment, (2) lower loan servicing fees at the Consumer Finance segment and (3) lower investment services income at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary due to stock market volatility during 2016.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal noninterest income increased $1.3 million, or 6.7 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in total noninterest income for 2015 was attributable to (1) higher loan production at the Mortgage Banking segment resulting in higher gains on sales of loans and ancillary loan origination fees and (2) higher investment services income at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by lower noninterest income at (1) the Retail Banking segment due to a decline in overdraft and maintenance fees, which was offset in part by higher debit card interchange income and other branch fee income and (2) lower loan servicing fees at the Consumer Finance segment. Other income for both the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments decreased due to the inclusion of net unrealized depreciation in noninterest expense related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, compared to net appreciation included in noninterest income during 2014.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nTABLE 4: Noninterest Expense\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

same period in 2015. The increase in total noninterest expenses for 2016 resulted primarily from higher personnel costs during 2016 (1) at C&F Bank because of increased staff levels and support positions associated with personnel dedicated to growing C&F Bank's commercial and small business loan portfolios, including its expansion into Charlottesville, Virginia in June 2016, (2) at C&F Mortgage because of higher loan production and the Mortgage Banking segment's expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and Moyock, North Carolina, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016, (3) at C&F Finance because of personnel additions in certain major markets, competition for qualified personnel and staffing increases for compliance and asset quality processes, and (4) at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary because of its expansion initiatives in Williamsburg and Newport News, Virginia beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Noninterest expense also increased because of operating expenses associated with (1) strengthening the Bank's technology infrastructure and expanding its product offerings and promoting brand awareness, (2) updating and enhancing C&F Mortgage's compliance management system and processes for originating residential loans and improving the quality of its loan origination process and (3) investing in technology at C&F Finance to improve efficiencies, help manage the rigorous regulatory burdens, and strengthen its compliance management system, which the Corporation anticipates will contribute to capturing more business.These increases were offset in part because noninterest expenses for both the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments included net unrealized depreciation related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, compared to net appreciation included in noninterest income during 2016.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal noninterest expenses increased $2.6 million, or 4.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in total noninterest expenses for 2015 resulted primarily from higher personnel costs during 2015 (1) at C&F Bank due to increased staff levels and support positions associated with personnel dedicated to growing C&F Bank's commercial and small business loan portfolios, (2) at C&F Mortgage due to higher production-based compensation associated with the higher loan volume and (3) at C&F Finance due to entry into new markets over the past several years, competition for qualified personnel and staffing increases for compliance and asset quality processes. Other expenses at C&F Finance increased due to higher (1) collection expenses, (2) loan application volume and (3) conversion costs related to data processing and front-end lending systems to enhance our ability to capture a larger share of the market and support future growth. Other expenses for both the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments included net unrealized depreciation related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, compared to net appreciation included in noninterest income during 2014. The other segment, which principally includes the Corporation's holding company operations and wealth management subsidiary, experienced increases in general corporate expenses. Cost savings related to the integration of CVB into the Bank's infrastructure contributed to the decline in total noninterest expense at the Retail Banking segment.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense on 2016 earnings was $4.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.9 percent, compared with $4.9 million, or 27.9 percent, in 2015 and $5.1 million, or 29.4 percent, in 2014. As described in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 2: Adoption of New Accounting Standards,\u201d effective\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nJanuary 1, 2015, the Corporation began recognizing amortization of its investments in qualified affordable housing projects as a component of income taxes. As required by ASU 2014-01, noninterest expense and income tax expense for 2014 has been restated for the retrospective application of this standard. Accordingly, income tax expense included $406,000 and $415,000 of amortization of its investments in qualified affordable housing projects during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Corporation's effective tax rate has progressively declined over the past three years as a result of earnings growth at the Retail Banking segment, which is exempt from state income taxes and has substantial tax-exempt income on securities issued by states and political subdivisions.\nAs described in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 2: Adoption of New Accounting Standards,\u201d during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Corporation began recognizing excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments, including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards, within income tax expense. In accordance with the adoption provisions of ASU 2016-09, income tax expense for 2016 was reduced by $229,000, which was the aggregate excess tax benefits for the entire year and contributed to the decline in the Corporation's effective tax rate for 2016.\nASSET QUALITY\nAllowance and Provision for Loan Losses\nAllowance for Loan Losses Methodology - Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking. We conduct an analysis of the collectibility of the loan portfolio on a regular basis. This analysis does not apply to PCI loans, loans carried at fair value, loans held for sale or off-balance sheet credit exposure (e.g., unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit). We use this analysis to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and to determine the necessary provision for loan losses.\nThe analysis, at a minimum, considers the following factors:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting, collection, charge-off and recovery;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the quality of our loan review system;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe effect of other external factors, such as competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHistorical trends of actual loan losses based on volume and types of loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSignificant one-time transactions affecting the allowance for loan losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn conjunction with the factors described above, we consider the following risk elements that are inherent in the loan portfolio as part of the analysis:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate residential mortgage loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule, the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the principal amount of the loan.

In addition to these loans, all substandard commercial, construction and residential loans in excess of $500,000 and all troubled debt restructurings are considered for individual impairment testing. We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. A loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected. If a loan is considered impaired, impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, we follow a consistent process to measure that impairment in our loan portfolio. We then establish a specific allowance for impaired loans based on the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its estimated fair value. For collateral dependent loans we obtain an updated appraisal if we do not have a current one on file. Appraisals are performed by independent third party appraisers with relevant industry experience. We may make adjustments to the appraised value based on recent sales of similar properties or general market conditions when appropriate. We also estimate costs to sell collateral in the measurement of impairment if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan.\nThe remaining non-impaired loans are grouped by loan type (e.g., commercial real estate, commercial, residential mortgage, consumer). We assign each loan type an allowance factor based on the historical loss rate for that type of loan and an evaluation of the qualitative factors mentioned above to determine a general allowance. We assign classified loans (i.e., special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss) a higher allowance factor than non-classified loans within a particular loan type based on our concerns regarding collectibility. Our allowance factors increase with the severity of classification. Allowance factors used for unclassified loans are based on our analysis of charge-off history for relevant periods of time which can vary depending on economic conditions, and our judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment including the general economic conditions. Our analysis of charge-off history also considers economic cycles and the trends during those cycles. Those cycles that more closely match the current environment are considered more relevant during our review. The allowance for loan losses is the aggregate of specific allowances and the general allowance for each portfolio type.\nAs discussed above we segregate loans meeting the criteria for special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss from non-classified, or pass rated, loans. We review the characteristics of each rating at least annually, generally during the first quarter. The characteristics of these ratings are as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPass rated loans are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition, appropriate collateral margins, appropriate cash flow to service the existing loan, and an appropriate leverage ratio. The borrower has paid all obligations as agreed and it is expected that this type of payment history will continue. When necessary, acceptable personal guarantors support the loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecial mention loans have a specific defined weakness in the borrower's operations and the borrower's ability to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis. The borrower's recent payment history may be characterized by late payments. The Corporation's risk exposure is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan. The collateral is considered to be well-margined, well maintained, accessible and readily marketable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubstandard loans are considered to have specific and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of the Corporation's credit extension. The payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment source may be inadequate to service the loan. The estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and/or ability of the personal guarantor(s) to pay the loan may not adequately protect the Corporation. There is a distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term. A substandard loan would not automatically meet the Corporation's definition of impaired unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower's performance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSubstandard nonaccrual loans have the same characteristics as substandard loans; however they have a non-accrual classification because it is probable that the Corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDoubtful rated loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan that is classified substandard but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoss rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future payment on the loan. Loss rated loans are fully charged off.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses Methodology - PCI Loans - As previously described, on a quarterly basis we evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans. These evaluations require the continued assessment of key assumptions and estimates similar to the initial estimate of fair value, such as the effect of collateral value changes, changing loss severities, estimated and experienced prepayment speeds and other relevant factors. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows to be collected on a PCI loan will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. For a more detailed description, see Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Item 7.\nAllowance for Loan Losses Methodology - Consumer Finance. The Consumer Finance segment's loans consist of non-prime automobile loans. These loans carry risks associated with (1) the continued credit-worthiness of borrowers who may be unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources and (2) the value of rapidly-depreciating collateral. These loans do not lend themselves to a classification process because of the short duration of time between delinquency and repossession. Therefore, the loan loss allowance review process generally focuses on the levels of and trends in delinquencies, deferrals, defaults, repossessions and losses. Allowance factors also include an analysis of charge-off history for relevant periods of time which can vary depending on economic conditions and competition, and our judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment. Loans are segregated between performing and nonperforming loans. Performing loans are those that have made timely payments in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and that are not past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans are those that do not accrue interest and are greater than 90 days past due.\nIn accordance with its policies and guidelines and consistent with industry practices, C&F Finance, at times, offers payment deferrals to borrowers, whereby the borrower is allowed to move up to two payments within a twelve-month rolling period to the end of the loan. A fee will be collected for extensions only in states that permit it. An account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account. Thereafter, such an account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account. We evaluate the results of this deferment strategy based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections. Payment deferrals may affect the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses. The average amounts deferred, as a percentage of loans outstanding, was 2.21 percent in 2016, 2.13 percent in 2015 and 2.10 percent in 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses increases the allowance, and loans charged off, net of recoveries, reduce the allowance.

2016. There was no provision for loan losses at the Retail Banking segment during 2016 because of the overall improvement in the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by the decline in nonaccrual loans and the decline in accruing loans past due for 90 days or more. The allowance for loan losses to total loans, excluding purchased credit impaired loans, declined to 1.63 percent at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.86 percent at December 31, 2015. We believe that the current level of the allowance for loan losses at C&F Bank is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, based on the relevant history of charge-offs and recoveries, current economic conditions, overall portfolio quality and review of specific criticized loans. If loan concentrations within the Bank's loan portfolio result in higher credit risk or if economic conditions begin to worsen, a higher loan loss allowance may be warranted in future periods, which may require a provision for loan losses.\nThe Consumer Finance segment's allowance for loan losses increased by $1.4 million to $25.4 million at December 31, 2016 from $24.0 million at December 31, 2015, and its provision for loan losses increased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. The higher provision resulted from an increase in charge-offs and loan growth during 2016. Loans charged off increased during 2016 because of economic conditions affecting non-prime consumer finance customers and competitive factors in the market for non-prime consumer finance loans. The net charge-off ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 5.59 percent, compared to 5.50 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans increased to 8.40 percent at December 31, 2016, compared to 8.21 percent at December 31, 2015. The inclusion of the purchased consumer finance loans, which were recorded at a discount, had the effect of reducing this ratio 14 and 32 basis points at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While we expect the purchase discount accretion on this portfolio to mitigate the potential effect of losses on the purchased portfolio, this portfolio is routinely re-evaluated as part of the segment's overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, in 2016, the Consumer Finance segment began purchasing more loan contracts with higher credit quality metrics, which management expects will help reduce future charge-offs. As previously described, the Consumer Finance segment, at times, offers payment deferrals to borrowers as a management technique to achieve higher ultimate cash collections on select loan accounts. Payment deferrals may affect the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off. A significant reliance on deferrals as a means of managing collections may result in a lengthening of the loss\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconfirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The average amounts deferred, as a percentage of average loans outstanding during 2016 was 2.21%, compared to 2.13% during 2015.\nWe believe that the current level of the allowance for loan losses at the Consumer Finance segment is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, if factors influencing the Consumer Finance segment result in higher net charge-off ratio in future periods, the Consumer Finance segment may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses, which could negatively affect future earnings of the Consumer Finance segment.\nNonperforming Assets\nA loan's past due status is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. For those loans that are carried on nonaccrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable assurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed. These policies are applied consistently across our loan portfolio, including purchased loans.\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of like properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. We may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the property valuations are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets and improvements are capitalized.\nBecause C&F Finance focuses on non-prime borrowers, the anticipated rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on the consumer finance loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase at the Consumer Finance segment. These periods also may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which we may sell repossessed automobiles or delay the timing of these sales. While we manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non-prime borrowers through the underwriting criteria and collection methods employed by C&F Finance, we cannot guarantee that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks. However, we believe that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb any losses on existing Consumer Finance segment loans that may become uncollectible.\nAt the Consumer Finance segment, the automobile repossession process is generally initiated after a loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. Repossessions are handled by independent repossession firms engaged by C&F Finance. After the prescribed waiting period, the repossessed automobile is sold in a third-party auction. We credit the proceeds from the sale of the automobile, and any other recoveries, against the balance of the loan and related fees. Proceeds from the sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the loan, and the resulting deficiency is charged off. The charge-off represents the difference between the actual net sale proceeds minus collections and repossession expenses and the principal balance of the delinquent loan. C&F Finance pursues collection of deficiencies, as allowed by state law, when it deems such action to be appropriate.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTable 8 summarizes nonperforming assets at December 31 of each of

percent decrease during 2016. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016 included $4.2 million of nonaccrual loans, compared to $6.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $195,000 of OREO compared to $942,000 at December 31, 2015. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans increased to 262.46 percent at December 31, 2016 from 178.93 percent at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual loans since December 31, 2015 was primarily due to loan payoffs and transfers to OREO.\nThe Corporation's aggregate OREO properties were $195,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $942,000 at December 31, 2015, and primarily consisted of residential lots. These properties have been written down to their estimated fair values less cost to sell. The decrease in OREO during 2016 was primarily due to the sale of several OREO properties and a shorter holding period for properties transferred to OREO during 2016.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNonaccrual loans at the Consumer Finance segment decreased to $565,000 at December 31, 2016 from $830,000 at December 31, 2015. As noted above, the allowance for loan losses at the Consumer Finance segment increased from $24.0.million at December 31, 2015 to $25.4 million at December 31, 2016, and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total consumer finance loans was 8.40 percent as of December 31, 2016, compared to 8.21 percent at December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual consumer finance loans remain low relative to the allowance for loan losses and the total consumer finance loan portfolio because the Consumer Finance segment generally initiates repossession of loan collateral once a loan is 60 days or more past due but before the loan reaches 90 days or more past due and is evaluated for nonaccrual status. At December 31, 2016, repossessed assets totaled $3.1 million, compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2015.\nIf interest on nonaccrual loans had been recognized, we would have recorded additional gross interest income of $304,000 for 2016, $531,000 for 2015, and $413,000 for 2014. Interest received on nonaccrual loans was $247,000 for 2016, $246,000 in 2015, $233,000 in 2014.\nAs discussed above, we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment. TDRs occur when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. These concessions typically are made for loss mitigation purposes and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. TDRs are considered impaired loans.\nImpaired loans, which consisted solely of TDRs, and the related allowance at December 31, 2016, were as follows:\nTABLE 10A: Impaired Loans\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnpaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nin Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nin Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrincipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwithout\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwith\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRelated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImpaired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecific Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecific Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAllowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate -

If a loan was on nonaccrual status at the time of the TDR modification, the loan will remain on nonaccrual status following the modification and may be returned to accrual status based on the Corporation's policy for returning loans to accrual status. If a loan was accruing prior to being modified as a TDR and if the Corporation concludes that the borrower is able to make such modified payments, and there are no other factors or circumstances that would cause it to conclude otherwise, the TDR will remain on an accruing status.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nSUMMARY\nA financial institution's primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets and sales of financial assets, while its major expenses are produced by the funding of those assets with interest-bearing liabilities, provisions for loan losses and compensation to employees. Effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution's maximum profitability while maintaining an acceptable level of risk.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Corporation had total assets of $1.45 billion compared to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2015. The significant components of the Corporation's balance sheet are discussed below.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\nGeneral\nThrough the Retail Banking segment, we engage in a wide range of lending activities, which include the origination, primarily in the Retail Banking segment's market area, of (1) one-to-four family and multi-family residential mortgage loans, (2) commercial real estate loans, (3) construction loans, (4) land acquisition and development loans, (5) consumer loans and (6) commercial business loans. We engage in non-prime automobile lending through the Consumer Finance segment and in residential mortgage lending through the Mortgage Banking segment with the majority of the loans originated through the Mortgage Banking segment sold to third-party investors. At December 31, 2016, the Corporation's loans held for investment in all categories, net of the allowance for loan losses, totaled $960.2 million and loans held for sale had a fair value of $52.0 million.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTables 12 and 13 present information pertaining to the composition of loans held for investment and maturity/repricing of certain loans held for investment.\nTABLE 12: Summary

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total loans from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to loan growth at the Retail Banking segment, especially in the commercial and real estate construction portfolios, as well as organic loan growth in the Consumer Finance segment during 2016. The increase in total loans of the Retail Banking segment was driven by successful investments in our commercial lending personnel and strength in commercial lending in our local markets, as well as expansion into new markets. The increase in total loans of the Consumer Finance segment resulted primarily from the implementation of a scorecard model at the Consumer Finance segment in 2016 that contributed to the growth through underwriting and pricing efficiencies.\nTotal loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 included loans purchased in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of CVB on October 1, 2013. These loans were recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition without the carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. On the date of acquisition, the Corporation acquired PCI loans with a fair value of $35.3 million and purchased performing loans with a fair value of $111.8 million.

The policy provides guidance in general credit policies, underwriting policies and risk management, credit approval, and administrative and problem asset management policies. The overall goal of the Corporation's credit policy is to ensure that loan growth is accompanied by acceptable asset quality with uniform and consistently applied approval, administration, and documentation practices and standards.\nResidential Mortgage Lending - Held for Sale\nThe Mortgage Banking segment's guidelines for underwriting conventional conforming loans comply with the underwriting criteria established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and/or the applicable third party investor. The guidelines for non-conforming conventional loans are based on the requirements of private investors and information provided by third-party investors. The guidelines used by C&F Mortgage to originate FHA-insured, USDA-guaranteed and VA-guaranteed loans comply with the criteria established by HUD, the USDA, the VA and/or the applicable third party investor. The conventional loans that C&F Mortgage originates that have loan-to-value ratios greater than 80 percent at origination are generally insured by private mortgage insurance.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResidential Mortgage Lending - Held for Investment\nThe Retail Banking segment originates residential mortgage loans secured by first and second liens on properties located in its primary market area in the Hampton to Charlottesville corridor in Virginia. The Bank offers various types of residential first mortgage loans in addition to traditional long-term, fixed-rate loans. The majority of such loans include 10, 15 and 30 year amortizing mortgage loans with fixed rates of interest and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of 20, 25 and 30 years but subject to call after five years at the Bank's option. Second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates. Second mortgage loans are granted for a fixed period of time, usually between five and 20 years. Call option provisions are included in the loan documents for some longer-term, fixed-rate second mortgage loans, and these provisions allow the Bank to make interest rate adjustments for such loans.\nLoans associated with residential mortgage lending are included in the real estate-residential mortgage category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nConstruction Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment has a real estate construction lending program. We make loans primarily for the construction of one-to-four family residences and, to a lesser extent, multi-family dwellings. The Bank also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects, generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the Retail Banking segment.\nThe amounts, interest rates and terms for construction loans vary, depending upon market conditions, the size and complexity of the project, and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan. The term for a typical construction loan ranges from nine months to 15 months for the construction of an individual residence and from 15 months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects. We do not typically amortize construction loans, and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan. The Bank offers fixed and variable interest rates on construction loans. We do not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis. For residential builder loans, we limit the number of models and/or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions, the builder's financial strength and track record and other factors. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for one-to-four family residential construction loans is 80 percent of the property's fair market value, or 85 percent of the property's fair market value if the property will be the borrower's primary residence. The fair market value of a project is determined on the basis of an appraisal of the project conducted by an appraiser approved by the Bank. For larger projects where unit absorption or leasing is a concern, we may also obtain a feasibility study or other acceptable information from the borrower or other sources about the likely disposition of the property following the completion of construction.\nConstruction loans for nonresidential projects and multi-unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the Bank than residential mortgage loans. We attempt to minimize such risks (1) by making construction loans in accordance with our underwriting standards and to established customers in our primary market area and (2) by monitoring the quality, progress and cost of construction. Generally, our maximum loan-to-value ratio for non-residential projects and multi-unit residential projects is 80 percent; however, this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis.\nLoans associated with construction lending are included in the real estate-construction category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nConsumer Lot Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment's consumer lot loans are made to individuals for the purpose of acquiring an unimproved building site for the construction of a residence that generally will be occupied by the borrower. Consumer lot loans are made only to individual borrowers, and each borrower generally must certify his or her intention to build and occupy a single-family residence on the lot. These loans typically have a maximum term of either three or five years with a balloon payment of the entire balance of the loan being due in full at the end of the initial term. The interest rate for these loans is fixed or variable at a rate that is slightly higher than prevailing rates for one-to-four family residential mortgage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nloans. We do not believe consumer lot loans bear as much risk as land acquisition and development loans because such loans are not made for the construction of residences for immediate resale, are not made to developers and builders, and are not concentrated in any one subdivision or community.\nLoans associated with consumer lot lending are included in the real estate-construction category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment's commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by the value of real property. The proceeds of commercial real estate loans are generally used by the borrower to finance or refinance the cost of acquiring and/or improving a commercial property. The properties that typically secure these loans are office and warehouse facilities, hotels, apartment complexes, retail facilities, restaurants and other commercial properties. Present policy authorizes commercial real estate loans to borrowers who will occupy or use the financed property in connection with their normal business operations. We also will consider making commercial real estate loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties under the following two conditions: (1) the borrower is in strong financial condition and presents a substantial business opportunity for the Corporation and (2) the borrower has substantially pre-leased the improvements to high-caliber tenants.\nOur commercial real estate loans are usually amortized over a period of time ranging from 15 years to 25 years and usually have a term to maturity ranging from five years to 15 years. These loans normally have provisions for interest rate adjustments after the loan is three to five years old. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for a commercial real estate loan is 80 percent; however, this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis. Most commercial real estate loans are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees.\nIn recent years, we have structured a portion of our commercial real estate loans as mini-permanent loans. The amortization period, term and interest rates for these loans vary based on borrower preferences and our assessment of the loan and the degree of risk involved. If the borrower prefers a fixed rate of interest, we usually offer a loan with a fixed rate of interest for a term of three to ten years with an amortization period of up to 25 years. The remaining balance of the loan is due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of the initial term. We believe these loan terms provide some protection from changes in the borrower's business and income as well as changes in general economic conditions. In the case of fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, shorter maturities also provide an opportunity to adjust the interest rate on this type of interest-earning asset in accordance with our asset and liability management strategies. Certain commercial customers qualify for participation in an interest rate swap program that was initiated in 2016. This program provides flexible pricing structures for our larger borrowers who wish to pay a fixed rate of interest, while preserving a floating rate for the Bank thus protecting C&F Bank from exposure to rising interest rates.\nLoans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are usually dependent on successful operation or management of the properties securing such loans, repayment of such loans is subject to changes in both general and local economic conditions and the borrower's business and income. As a result, events beyond our control, such as a downturn in the local economy, could adversely affect the performance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. We seek to minimize these risks by lending to established customers and generally restricting our commercial real estate loans to our primary market area. Emphasis is placed on the income producing characteristics and quality of the collateral.\nLoans associated with commercial real estate lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nLand Acquisition and Development Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment makes land acquisition and development loans to builders and developers for the purpose of acquiring unimproved land to be developed for residential building sites, residential housing subdivisions, multi-family dwellings and a variety of commercial uses. Our policy is to make land acquisition loans to borrowers for the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npurpose of acquiring developed lots for single-family, townhouse or condominium construction. We will make both land acquisition and development loans to residential builders, experienced developers and others in strong financial condition to provide additional construction and mortgage lending opportunities for the Bank.\nWe underwrite and process land acquisition and development loans in much the same manner as commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans. For land acquisition and development loans, we use lower loan-to-value ratios, which are a maximum of 65 percent for raw land, 75 percent for land development and improved lots and 80 percent of the discounted appraised value of the property as determined in accordance with the appraisal policies for developed lots for single-family or townhouse construction. We can waive the maximum loan-to-value ratio for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis. The term of land acquisition and development loans ranges from a maximum of two years for loans relating to the acquisition of unimproved land to, generally, a maximum of three years for other types of projects. All land acquisition and development loans generally are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees. Because these loans are usually larger in amount and involve more risk than consumer lot loans, we carefully evaluate the borrower's assumptions and projections about market conditions and absorption rates in the community in which the property is located and the borrower's ability to carry the loan if the borrower's assumptions prove inaccurate.\nLoans associated with land acquisition and development lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nBuilder Line Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment offers builder lines of credit to residential home builders to support their land and lot inventory needs. A construction loan facility for a builder will typically have an expiration of 12 months or less. Each loan that is made under the master loan facility will have a stated maturity that allows time for the residential unit to be constructed and sold to a homebuyer under prevailing market conditions. Specific terms vary based on the purpose of the loan (e.g., lot inventory, spec or non pre-sold units, pre-sold units) and previous sales activity to new homebuyers in the particular development. Repayment relies upon the successful performance of the underlying residential real estate project. This type of lending carries a higher level of risk related to residential real estate market conditions, a functioning first and secondary market in which to sell residential properties, and the borrower's ability to manage inventory and run projects. We manage this risk by lending to experienced builders and by using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans.\nLoans associated with builder line lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nCommercial Business Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment's commercial business loan products include revolving lines of credit to provide working capital, term loans to finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment, letters of credit to guarantee payment and performance, and other commercial loans. In general, these credit facilities carry the unconditional guaranty of the owners and/or stockholders.\nRevolving and operating lines of credit are typically secured by all current assets of the borrower, provide for the acceleration of repayment upon any event of default, are monitored monthly or quarterly to ensure compliance with loan covenants, and are re-underwritten or renewed annually. Interest rates generally will float at a spread tied to the Bank's prime lending rate. Term loans are generally advanced for the purchase of, and are secured by, vehicles and equipment and are normally fully amortized over a term of two to five years, on either a fixed or floating rate basis.\nLoans associated with commercial business lending are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEquity Line Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment offers its customers home equity lines of credit that enable customers to borrow funds secured by the equity in their homes. Currently, home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest that are generally priced at a spread to the prime lending rate. Home equity lines of credit are made on an open-end, revolving basis. Home equity loans generally do not present as much risk to the Bank as other types of consumer loans. These loans must satisfy our underwriting criteria, including loan-to-value and credit score guidelines.\nLoans associated with equity line lending are included in the equity lines category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nConsumer Lending\nThe Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer loans, including automobile, personal secured and unsecured, and loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit. The shorter terms and generally higher interest rates on consumer loans help the Bank maintain a profitable spread between its average loan yield and its cost of funds. Consumer loans secured by collateral other than a personal residence generally involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. However, we believe the higher yields generally earned on such loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans. These loans must satisfy our underwriting criteria, including loan-to-value, debt ratio and credit score guidelines.\nLoans associated with consumer lending are included in the consumer category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\nConsumer Finance\nThe Consumer Finance segment has an extensive automobile dealer network through which it purchases installment contracts throughout its markets. Credit approval is centralized in two locations, which along with the application processing system, ensures that contract purchase decisions comply with C&F Finance's underwriting policies and procedures.\nFinance contract application packages completed by prospective borrowers are submitted by the automobile dealers electronically through a third-party online automotive sales and finance platform to C&F Finance's automated origination and application system, which processes the credit bureau report, generates all relevant loan calculations and displays the requested contract structure. C&F Finance personnel with credit authority review the transaction and determine whether to approve or deny the purchase of the contract. The purchase decision is based primarily on the applicant's credit history with emphasis on prior auto loan history, current employment status, income, collateral type and mileage, and the loan-to-value ratio. In the first half of 2016, C&F Finance implemented a scorecard model that improved underwriting and pricing efficiencies.\nThe Consumer Finance segment's underwriting and collateral guidelines form the basis for the purchase decision. Exceptions to credit policies and authorities must be approved by a designated credit officer. C&F Finance's typical customers have experienced prior credit difficulties. Because C&F Finance serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources, we expect C&F Finance to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources. However, C&F Finance generally purchases contracts with interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources. These higher rates should more than offset the increase in the provision for loan losses for this segment of the Corporation's loan portfolio.\nLoans associated with automobile sales finance are included in the consumer finance category in Table 12: Summary of Loans Held for Investment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSECURITIES\nThe investment portfolio plays a primary role in the management of the Corporation's interest rate sensitivity. In addition, the portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used as needed to meet collateral requirements. The investment portfolio consists of securities available for sale, which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, all securities in the Corporation's investment portfolio were classified as available for sale.\nTable 15 sets forth the composition of the Corporation's securities available for sale in dollar amounts at fair value and as a percentage of the Corporation's total securities available for sale at the dates indicated.\nTABLE 15: Securities Available for Sale\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. government agencies and corporations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,112 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,501 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,816 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,027 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n117,098 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n123,948 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal available for sale securities at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n210,026 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,476 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation seeks to diversify its portfolio to minimize risk, including by purchasing shorter-duration mortgage-backed securities to reduce interest rate risk and for cash flow and reinvestment opportunities and securities issued by states and political subdivisions due to the tax benefits and the higher tax-adjusted yield obtained from these securities. All of the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities are direct issues of United States government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. The municipal bond sector, which is included in the Corporation's obligations of states and political subdivisions category of securities, is the largest component within the securities portfolio. At December 31, 2016, approximately 97 percent of the Corporation's obligations of states and political subdivisions, as measured by market value, were rated A\u201d or better by Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investors Service.\nTable 16 presents additional information pertaining to the composition of the securities portfolio by the earlier of contractual maturity or expected maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTABLE 16: Maturity

of funds is depository accounts, which are comprised of demand deposits, savings and money market accounts, and time deposits. The Corporation's deposits are principally provided by individuals and businesses located within the communities served.\nDeposits totaled $1.12 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.07 billion at December 31, 2015. This increase primarily consisted of a $20.7 million increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits and a $20.9 million increase in savings, money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, which reflected depositors' preferences for maintaining flexibility regarding their investment options and the availability of their funds in the event of an increase in interest rates.\nThe Corporation had $3.6 million in brokered money market deposits outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared to $2.9 million in brokered money market deposits at December 31, 2015. The source of these brokered deposits is uninvested cash balances held in third-party brokerage sweep accounts. The Corporation uses brokered deposits as a means of diversifying liquidity sources, as opposed to a long-term deposit gathering strategy.\nTable 17 presents the average deposit balances and average rates paid for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTABLE 17: Average Deposits and Rates Paid\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n210,520 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n185,774 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n166,928 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest-bearing transaction accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n211,441 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n203,614 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.22 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n186,548 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoney market deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n213,793 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.27 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n204,597 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.28 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n181,530 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.27 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,899 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.08 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n99,585 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.08 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n97,643 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.09 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCertificates of deposit, $100 thousand or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,115 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.04 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,878 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.92 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,502 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.93 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n198,061 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.91 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n209,909 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.87 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241,231 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.73 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n868,309 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.50 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n857,583 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.49 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n846,454 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.48 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,078,829 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,043,357 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,013,382 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18 details maturities of certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2016.\nTABLE 18: Maturities of Certificates of Deposit with Balances of $100,000 or More\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3 months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,070 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n3-6 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,979 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n6-12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,401 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,287 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n161,737 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBORROWINGS\nIn addition to deposits, the Corporation utilizes short-term and long-term borrowings as sources of funds. Short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB may be used to fund the Corporation's day-to-day operations. Short-term borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are secured transactions with customers and generally mature the day following the day sold, and overnight unsecured fed funds lines with correspondent banks. Long-term borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB, advances under a non-recourse revolving bank line of credit, and securities sold under agreement to repurchase with a third-party correspondent bank. All FHLB advances are secured by a blanket floating lien on all of C&F Bank's qualifying closed-end and revolving open-end loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties. All Federal Reserve Bank advances are secured by loan-specific liens on certain qualifying loans of C&F Bank that are not otherwise pledged. The bank line of credit is non-recourse and is secured by loans at C&F Finance. The repurchase agreement is secured by a portion of C&F Bank's securities portfolio.\nIn December, 2007, Trust II, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred capital securities for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of existing debt. On December 14, 2007, Trust II issued $10.0 million of trust preferred capital securities in a private placement to an institutional investor and $310,000 in common equity to the Corporation. The principal asset of Trust II is $10.3 million of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes. In July 2005, Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred capital securities to partially fund the Corporation's purchase of 427,186 shares of its common stock. On July 21, 2005, Trust I issued $10.0 million of trust preferred capital securities in a private placement to an institutional investor and $310,000 in common equity to the Corporation. The principal asset of Trust I is $10.3 million of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes. In December 2003, CVBK Trust I was formed for the purpose of issuing $5.0 million of trust preferred capital securities in private placements to institutional investors. The principal asset of CVBK Trust I is $5.2 million of trust preferred capital notes originally issued by CVBK and then assumed by the Corporation.\nFor further information concerning the Corporation's borrowings, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 9. Borrowings.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nTo meet the financing needs of customers, the Corporation is a party, in the normal course of business, to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in addition to the amount on the balance sheet. The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making these commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. We obtain collateral based on our credit assessment of the customer in each circumstance.\nLoan commitments are agreements to extend credit to a customer provided that there are no violations of the terms of the contract prior to funding. Commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The total amount of unused loan commitments was $225.0 million at December 31, 2016, and $159.2 million at December 31, 2015.\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The total contract amount of standby letters of credit was $14.8 million at December 31, 2016, and $11.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, C&F Mortgage had interest rate lock commitments (or IRLCs) to originate mortgage loans aggregating $56.3 million and loans held for sale of $50.3 million. At December 31, 2016, each loan held for sale by C&F Mortgage was subject to a forward sales agreement on a best efforts basis. C&F Mortgage enters into IRLCs with customers and will sell the underlying loans to investors on either a best efforts or a mandatory delivery basis. C&F Mortgage mitigates interest rate risk on IRLCs and loans held for sale by (a) entering into forward loan sales contracts with investors for loans to be delivered on a best efforts basis or (b) entering into forward sales contracts of mortgage-backed to-be-announced securities (TBAs) for loans to be delivered on a mandatory basis. Both the IRLCs with customers and the forward sales contracts are considered derivative financial instruments. At December 31, 2016, C&F Mortgage had best efforts forward sales contracts with a notional value of $106.6 million. The fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2016 was $663,000, which was included in other assets. There were no loans to be delivered on a mandatory basis at December 31, 2016.\nC&F Mortgage sells substantially all of the residential mortgage loans it originates to third-party counterparties. As is customary in the industry, the agreements with these counterparties require C&F Mortgage to extend representations and warranties with respect to lending program compliance, borrower misrepresentation, fraud, and early payment performance. Under the agreements, the counterparties are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of C&F Mortgage for loans that contain covered deficiencies. C&F Mortgage has obtained early payment default recourse waivers for a significant portion of its business. Recourse periods for early payment default for the remaining counterparties vary from 90 days up to one year. Recourse periods for borrower misrepresentation or fraud, or underwriting error do not have a stated time limit. C&F Mortgage maintains an indemnification reserve that, in management's judgment, will be adequate to absorb any losses arising from valid indemnification requests. Payments made under these recourse provisions were $349,000 in 2016 and $566,000 in 2014. There were no payments made in 2015. Payments made during 2016 and 2014 primarily resulted from agreements with third-party counterparties in each year that resolved all known and unknown indemnification obligations for loans sold to these counterparties prior to August 2016 for the payment in 2016, and prior to May 2014 for the payment made in 2014.\nRisks also arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. C&F Mortgage has procedures in place to evaluate the credit risk of investors and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Corporation uses derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional principal amount and maturity date with no exchange of underlying principal amounts.\nThe Corporation has interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges. The Corporation's cash flow hedges effectively modify the Corporation's exposure to interest rate risk by converting variable rates of interest on $10.0 million and $15.0 million of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes to fixed rates of interest until September 2020 and December 2019, respectively. The cash flow hedges' total notional amount is $25.0 million. At December 31, 2016, the cash flow hedges had a fair value of $(56,000), which is recorded in other liabilities. The cash flow hedges were fully effective at December 31, 2016. Therefore, the net loss on the cash flow hedges was recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred income taxes.\nPursuant to a program the Corporation initiated during 2016, the Corporation also enters into interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Corporation simultaneously enters into interest rate swaps with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and terms. The net result of these interest rate swaps is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Corporation receives a floating rate. The total notional amount of the interest rate swaps on loans is $50.3 million. At December 31, 2016, the interest rate swaps had a net fair value of zero, with $1.03 million recognized in other assets and $1.03 million recognized in other liabilities. These swaps are not designated as hedging instruments; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in other noninterest expense.\nLIQUIDITY\nThe objective of the Corporation's liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors, creditors and investors. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position are the components of a solid foundation for the Corporation's liquidity position. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Corporation include cash flows from operations, loan payments and payoffs, deposit growth, sales of securities, the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and the capacity to borrow additional funds.\nLiquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits at other banks, federal funds sold and nonpledged securities available for sale, totaled $199.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $277.3 million at December 31, 2015.

We regularly review the adequacy of the Corporation's capital. We maintain a structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. While we will continue to look for opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth, share purchases are another tool that facilitates improving shareholder return, as measured by ROE and earnings per share.\nChanges to the regulatory capital framework that were approved in July 2013 by the federal banking agencies (the Basel III Final Rule) began applying to the Corporation and the Bank on January 1, 2015 subject to limited phase-in periods. In addition to the primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring capital position prior to 2015 (i.e., Tier 1 capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios), banking regulators now measure the common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio when evaluating an institution's capital position. Refer to Item 1. Business\u201d under the heading Regulation and Supervision\u201d for an overview of the Basel III Final Rules. The Corporation's CET1 to total risk-weighted assets ratio was 10.5 percent at December 31, 2016, compared with 11.2 percent at December 31, 2015. The Corporation's Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 12.6 percent at December 31, 2016, compared with 13.7 percent at December 31, 2015. The total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 13.9 percent at December 31, 2016, compared with\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n15.0 percent at December 31, 2015. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.3 percent at December 31, 2016, compared with 10.0 percent at December 31, 2015. These ratios are in excess of the mandated minimum requirements. These ratios include the trust preferred securities issued by the Corporation in December 2007 and July 2005, as well as issued by CVBK in 2003 and assumed by the Corporation in March 2014.\nIn addition to the regulatory risk-based capital amounts presented above, the Corporation and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer of additional total capital and CET1 as required by the Basel III Final Rule. The buffer began applying to the Corporation and the Bank on January 1, 2016, and is subject to phase-in from 2016 to 2019 in equal annual installments of 0.625%. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the Corporation and the Bank were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 0.625%. At December 31, 2016, the Corporation exceeded the total capital conservation buffer by 529 basis points, and the Bank exceeded the total capital conservation buffer by 541 basis points. Also at December 31, 2016, the Corporation and the Bank exceeded the CET1 capital conservation buffer by 535 basis points and 763 basis points, respectively.\nShareholders' equity was $139.2 million at year-end 2016 compared with $131.1 million at year-end 2015. During 2016, the Corporation declared common stock dividends of $1.29 per share, compared to $1.22 per share declared in 2015 and $1.19 per share declared in 2014. The dividend payout ratio was 33.1 percent of basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 33.2 percent in 2015 and 32.8 percent in 2014. On May 14, 2014, the Corporation repurchased from the United States Treasury a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 167,504 shares of the Corporation's common stock, par value $1.00 per share at an initial exercise price of $17.91 per share (Warrant). The Warrant was originally issued in connection with the Corporation's participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program. The Corporation paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 million for the Warrant, which has been cancelled. The funds for this redemption were provided by existing financial resources of the Corporation and no new capital was issued.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecent accounting pronouncements affecting the Corporation are described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Significant Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Corporation's financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U. S. GAAP\u201d). U. S. GAAP presently requires the Corporation to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Corporation is reflected in increased operating costs. In management's opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Corporation, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.", "summary": "The report discusses the forward-looking statements, potential risk factors, and the management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations.

We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.\nThe following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: We establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs for relevant periods of time, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower's ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. For more information, see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nAllowance for Indemnifications: The allowance for indemnifications is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for indemnifications, which is included in other noninterest expenses. A loss is charged against the allowance for indemnifications when a purchaser of a loan (investor) sold by C&F Mortgage incurs a validated indemnified loss due to borrower misrepresentation, fraud, early default, or underwriting error. The allowance represents an amount that, in management's judgment, will be adequate to absorb any losses arising from valid indemnification requests. Management's judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on the volume of loans sold, historical experience, current economic conditions and information provided by investors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Loans: We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. We do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due. We measure impairment on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial, construction and residential loans in excess of $500,000 by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment. Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are also considered impaired loans, even when the loan balance is less than $500,000. A TDR occurs when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. For more information see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination: Loans acquired in the acquisition of CVBK and its subsidiary CVB were segregated between (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and (ii) purchased performing loans and were recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition without the carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Corporation will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans were aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference,\u201d is not recorded and is available to absorb future credit losses on those loans. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable\u201d yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nSubsequent to acquisition, we evaluate on a quarterly basis our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Corporation's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of CVB. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming by CVB are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at quarterly re-estimation periods, we believe we will fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Corporation accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. Because there is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date, a provision for loan losses may be required in future periods for any deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nImpairment of Securities: Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nvalue. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO): Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Corporation may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nGoodwill: The Corporation's goodwill was recognized in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of CVBK in October 2013 and C&F Bank's acquisition of C&F Finance Company in September 2002. The Corporation reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. In assessing the recoverability of the Corporation's goodwill, major assumptions used in determining impairment are increases in future income, sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. If an impairment test is performed, we will prepare a sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate, lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income.\nRetirement Plan: C&F Bank maintains a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. C&F Bank's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may affect pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: The Corporation uses derivatives primarily to manage risk associated with changing interest rates and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. The Corporation's derivative financial instruments may include (1) interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on mortgage loans that will be held for sale and related forward sales commitments, (2) interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties and (3) interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes. The Corporation recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Because the IRLCs, forward sales commitments and interest rate swaps with loan customers and dealer counterparties are classified as free standing derivatives, adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these instruments are reported in the income statement. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the Corporation's cash flow hedges is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.\nIncome Taxes: Determining the Corporation's effective tax rate requires judgment. The Corporation's net deferred tax asset is determined annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. In addition, there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain and the Corporation's tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual.\nFor further information concerning accounting policies, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary financial goals are to maximize the Corporation's earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals: (i) return on average assets (ROA), (ii) return on average common equity (ROE), and (iii) growth in earnings. In addition to these financial performance measures, we track the performance of the Corporation's three principal business activities: retail banking, mortgage banking, and consumer finance. We also actively manage our capital through growth, dividends and share repurchases, while considering the need to maintain a strong regulatory capital position.\nFinancial Performance Measures\nNet income for the Corporation was $13.5 million in 2016, or $3.89 per common share assuming dilution, compared with net income of $12.5 million in 2015, or $3.68 per common share assuming dilution. The change in financial results for 2016, as compared to 2015, was attributable to increases in earnings at the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments, offset in part by decreases in earnings at the Consumer Finance segment and the Bank's wealth management subsidiary. See Principal Business Activities\u201d below for additional discussion.\nThe Corporation's ROE and ROA were 9.90 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 9.87 percent and 0.92 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in these ratios during 2016 resulted primarily from earnings growth, which outpaced the growth in average equity and average assets. Average equity increased due to internal capital growth and average assets increased primarily due to the 10.0 percent increase in average loans.\n2017 Outlook\nManagement believes the Corporation's financial performance in 2017 will be affected by (i) lower accretion income related to the fair value accounting adjustments for the CVBK acquisition, partially offset by an increase in interest income from growth in average loans outstanding, (ii) an uncertain interest rate environment and potential fluctuations in interest rates that may depress loan production levels in the Mortgage Banking segment, and (iii) continued elevated charge-off levels and competition in the Consumer Finance segment. The following additional factors could influence the Corporation's financial performance in 2017:\n \u00b7 Retail Banking: Growth in higher-yielding earning assets, specifically loans, will be our primary focus at the Bank during 2017. With commercial and small business lending teams already in our targeted markets in Charlottesville, Hampton, Newport News, Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia and the continued resurgence in the real estate development and construction sectors in our markets, we expect to continue to grow our loan portfolio during 2017. However, the general economic trends in the Bank's markets and the current low interest rate environment have contributed to increased competition and lower yields on both the loan and investment portfolios. It will be challenging to maintain the Retail Banking segment's net interest margin at its current level as the net accretion of the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the CVB acquisition decline and as the recent increase in the federal funds rate provides stimulus for higher-costing deposits. Also in 2017, we will continue to focus on our digital strategy because online and mobile access are quickly becoming the primary means of banking for many businesses and individuals, and we believe our digital strategy commitment is critical to remaining competitive within the financial services industry. \n \u00b7 Mortgage Banking: C&F Mortgage generates significant noninterest income from the sale of residential loan products into the secondary market. Although earnings increased at the Mortgage Banking segment in 2016, compared to 2015, increasing future profitability at the current origination levels will be challenging due to the fixed costs of maintaining the personnel, compliance and technology infrastructure required to support mortgage banking activities. While our goal is to increase origination volume through internal growth in existing markets and through strategic initiatives, such as our recent expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and Moyock, North Carolina, our ability to maintain a level of loan production in 2017 sufficient to sustain profitability will be dependent on market factors beyond our control, such as the interest rate environment and \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n changes in interest rates, housing starts and loan demand. If mortgage interest rates continue to rise during 2017, C&F Mortgage may experience a lower loan demand, particularly for mortgage refinancings, which could negatively affect earnings of the Mortgage Banking segment in 2017. In addition, during 2017 C&F Mortgage anticipates it will continue to (i) compete to retain and attract qualified loan officers, (ii) incur costs associated with updating and enhancing our compliance management system and processes for originating residential loans to mitigate compliance and regulatory risks, as well as improving the quality of our loan origination process and (iii) utilize systems to their fullest capacity in order to realize efficiencies overall in our mortgage banking processes and to create opportunities for revenue generation. \n \u00b7 Consumer Finance: C&F Finance provides automobile financing through programs that are designed to serve customers in the non-prime market. As has been the case for the last several years, competition in the non-prime automobile loan business remains aggressive, resulting in lower interest rates and in many cases, less restrictive underwriting standards by several of our competitors. As a result, organic loan growth was difficult during 2016, and we expect organic loan growth to be equally as challenging in 2017. However, C&F Finance implemented strategic initiatives in 2016 to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition. During 2016, C&F Finance implemented a scorecard model that improved underwriting and pricing efficiencies and contributed to loan growth. We expect this model, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, will lead to loan growth in 2017. Further, we believe our scorecard model, which results in the purchase of loans with higher credit metrics, should help reduce future charge-offs at C&F Finance. However, we believe it will be challenging to maintain the Consumer Finance segment's net interest margin at its current level as competition in the non-prime market causes yields to decline and the recent increase in the federal funds rate triggers higher-costing variable-rate borrowings. During 2017, we expect to continue investing in technology at C&F Finance in order to capture more business, improve efficiencies, and manage the rigorous regulatory burdens and evolving compliance issues in the indirect auto lending industry. \nPrincipal Business Activities\nAn overview of the financial results for each of the Corporation's principal segments is presented below. A more detailed discussion is included in the section Results of Operations.\u201d\nRetail Banking: The Retail Banking segment reported net income of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income for 2016 was positively influenced by (1) the effect of loan growth on interest income, as average loans at the Retail Banking segment increased $72.9 million or 12.6 percent during 2016 over 2015, (2) an increase in non-interest income due to fees collected on loans closed under a new loan interest rate swap program initiated in 2016, (3) an increase in debit card interchange income, and (4) a lower cost of borrowings resulting from the maturity and restructuring of the Bank's higher-rate FHLB advances. Also contributing to the increase in earnings during 2016 were one-time revenue items in the second quarter of 2016 associated with a contract amendment for one of the Bank's debit card programs ($237,000 after tax), the Bank's bank-owned life insurance program ($493,000 after tax) and a gain on the sale of a Bank-owned property ($92,000 after tax). Partially offsetting these positive factors were (1) a decline in the yield on the investment portfolio due to replacing matured and called securities with lower-yielding securities, (2) a decline in the yield on loans due to the effects of the low interest rate and competitive loan environment, and (3) higher operating expenses associated with strengthening C&F Bank's technology infrastructure, growing its commercial lending teams, expanding its product offerings and promoting brand awareness.\nThe results for both 2016 and 2015 for the Retail Banking segment have been affected by the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of CVB. These adjustments resulted from marking assets and liabilities acquired from CVB to their fair values as of the acquisition date. As a result, yields on loans and investments acquired from CVB increased and the cost of certificates of deposit decreased, the benefits of which were partially offset by the (1) amortization of the core deposit intangible and (2) higher depreciation expense associated with the buildings acquired in the CVB merger. The aggregate net accretion attributable to these fair value accounting adjustments was $1.2 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.3 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Retail Banking segment's nonperforming assets were $4.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016 included $4.2 million in nonaccrual loans, compared to $6.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $195,000 in OREO, compared to $942,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2016 was primarily due to loan payoffs and transfers to OREO. The OREO decrease during 2016 was primarily due to the sale of several OREO properties and a shorter holding period for properties transferred to OREO during 2016. Management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, based on the relevant history of charge-offs and recoveries, current economic conditions, overall portfolio quality, review of specific criticized loans and other factors analyzed by management. If loan concentrations within the Bank's loan portfolio result in higher credit risk or if economic conditions decline, a higher loan loss allowance may be warranted in future periods, which may require a provision for loan losses.\nMortgage Banking: The Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The improvement in net income of the Mortgage Banking segment for 2016 resulted from an increase in the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold during 2016, compared to 2015. Loan volume increased due to successful strategic initiatives and benefited from favorable housing markets for both resale and new construction, as well as favorable interest rates. The higher loan volume resulted in higher gains on sales of loans and higher ancillary loan origination fees. These revenue increases were partially offset by higher employee compensation and loan production expenses, as well as costs associated with the mortgage banking segment's expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $674.3 million from $549.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amount of loan originations during 2016 for refinancings and home purchases were $152.7 million and $521.6 million, respectively, compared to $104.4 million and $444.9 million, respectively, during 2015.\nConsumer Finance: The Consumer Finance segment reported net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in net income for 2016, compared to 2015, was principally due to an increase in the provision for loan losses from $15.5 million in 2015 to $18.0 million in 2016 because of higher net charge-offs, as discussed below, and loan growth. Partially offsetting the effect of the higher provision for loan losses was the effect on net interest income of the $13.7 million increase in average loans during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in average loans was attributable to the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2015, along with organic loan growth during 2016. C&F Finance has implemented a scorecard model that is providing underwriting efficiencies and generating more competitive pricing, which, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, led to an increase in loan originations during 2016.\nThe results of the Consumer Finance segment included an increase of $2.6 million in the provision for loan losses from 2015 to 2016. The net charge-off ratio for 2016 was 5.59 percent, compared to 5.50 percent for 2015. Loans charged off increased during 2016 because of economic and competitive factors affecting non-prime consumer finance customers. The allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to 8.40 percent at December 31, 2016, compared to 8.21 percent at December 31, 2015. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. If factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in a higher net charge-off ratio in the future, C&F Finance Company may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses, which could negatively affect future earnings.\nOther and Eliminations: The other segment, which principally includes the Corporation's holding company operations and wealth management subsidiary, reported an aggregate net loss of $975,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $955,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss during 2016 was due to lower earnings at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary due to stock market volatility during", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains statements concerning the Corporation's expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.

We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.\nThe following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: We establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs for relevant periods of time, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower's ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. For more information, see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nAllowance for Indemnifications: The allowance for indemnifications is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for indemnifications, which is included in other noninterest expenses. A loss is charged against the allowance for indemnifications when a purchaser of a loan (investor) sold by C&F Mortgage incurs a validated indemnified loss due to borrower misrepresentation, fraud, early default, or underwriting error. The allowance represents an amount that, in management's judgment, will be adequate to absorb any losses arising from valid indemnification requests. Management's judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on the volume of loans sold, historical experience, current economic conditions and information provided by investors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Loans: We consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. We do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due. We measure impairment on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial, construction and residential loans in excess of $500,000 by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. We maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment. Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are also considered impaired loans, even when the loan balance is less than $500,000. A TDR occurs when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan by granting a concession due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. For more information see the section titled Asset Quality\u201d within Item 7.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination: Loans acquired in the acquisition of CVBK and its subsidiary CVB were segregated between (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and (ii) purchased performing loans and were recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition without the carryover of the related allowance for loan losses.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Corporation will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans were aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference,\u201d is not recorded and is available to absorb future credit losses on those loans. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable\u201d yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nSubsequent to acquisition, we evaluate on a quarterly basis our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Corporation's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of CVB. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming by CVB are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at quarterly re-estimation periods, we believe we will fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Corporation accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. Because there is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date, a provision for loan losses may be required in future periods for any deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nImpairment of Securities: Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nvalue. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO): Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Corporation may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nGoodwill: The Corporation's goodwill was recognized in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of CVBK in October 2013 and C&F Bank's acquisition of C&F Finance Company in September 2002. The Corporation reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. In assessing the recoverability of the Corporation's goodwill, major assumptions used in determining impairment are increases in future income, sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. If an impairment test is performed, we will prepare a sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate, lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income.\nRetirement Plan: C&F Bank maintains a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. C&F Bank's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may affect pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: The Corporation uses derivatives primarily to manage risk associated with changing interest rates and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. The Corporation's derivative financial instruments may include (1) interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on mortgage loans that will be held for sale and related forward sales commitments, (2) interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties and (3) interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges of the Corporation's trust preferred capital notes. The Corporation recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Because the IRLCs, forward sales commitments and interest rate swaps with loan customers and dealer counterparties are classified as free standing derivatives, adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these instruments are reported in the income statement. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the Corporation's cash flow hedges is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.\nIncome Taxes: Determining the Corporation's effective tax rate requires judgment. The Corporation's net deferred tax asset is determined annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. In addition, there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain and the Corporation's tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual.\nFor further information concerning accounting policies, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d under the heading Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary financial goals are to maximize the Corporation's earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals: (i) return on average assets (ROA), (ii) return on average common equity (ROE), and (iii) growth in earnings. In addition to these financial performance measures, we track the performance of the Corporation's three principal business activities: retail banking, mortgage banking, and consumer finance. We also actively manage our capital through growth, dividends and share repurchases, while considering the need to maintain a strong regulatory capital position.\nFinancial Performance Measures\nNet income for the Corporation was $13.5 million in 2016, or $3.89 per common share assuming dilution, compared with net income of $12.5 million in 2015, or $3.68 per common share assuming dilution. The change in financial results for 2016, as compared to 2015, was attributable to increases in earnings at the Retail Banking and Mortgage Banking segments, offset in part by decreases in earnings at the Consumer Finance segment and the Bank's wealth management subsidiary. See Principal Business Activities\u201d below for additional discussion.\nThe Corporation's ROE and ROA were 9.90 percent and 0.96 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 9.87 percent and 0.92 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in these ratios during 2016 resulted primarily from earnings growth, which outpaced the growth in average equity and average assets. Average equity increased due to internal capital growth and average assets increased primarily due to the 10.0 percent increase in average loans.\n2017 Outlook\nManagement believes the Corporation's financial performance in 2017 will be affected by (i) lower accretion income related to the fair value accounting adjustments for the CVBK acquisition, partially offset by an increase in interest income from growth in average loans outstanding, (ii) an uncertain interest rate environment and potential fluctuations in interest rates that may depress loan production levels in the Mortgage Banking segment, and (iii) continued elevated charge-off levels and competition in the Consumer Finance segment. The following additional factors could influence the Corporation's financial performance in 2017:\n \u00b7 Retail Banking: Growth in higher-yielding earning assets, specifically loans, will be our primary focus at the Bank during 2017. With commercial and small business lending teams already in our targeted markets in Charlottesville, Hampton, Newport News, Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia and the continued resurgence in the real estate development and construction sectors in our markets, we expect to continue to grow our loan portfolio during 2017. However, the general economic trends in the Bank's markets and the current low interest rate environment have contributed to increased competition and lower yields on both the loan and investment portfolios. It will be challenging to maintain the Retail Banking segment's net interest margin at its current level as the net accretion of the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the CVB acquisition decline and as the recent increase in the federal funds rate provides stimulus for higher-costing deposits. Also in 2017, we will continue to focus on our digital strategy because online and mobile access are quickly becoming the primary means of banking for many businesses and individuals, and we believe our digital strategy commitment is critical to remaining competitive within the financial services industry. \n \u00b7 Mortgage Banking: C&F Mortgage generates significant noninterest income from the sale of residential loan products into the secondary market. Although earnings increased at the Mortgage Banking segment in 2016, compared to 2015, increasing future profitability at the current origination levels will be challenging due to the fixed costs of maintaining the personnel, compliance and technology infrastructure required to support mortgage banking activities. While our goal is to increase origination volume through internal growth in existing markets and through strategic initiatives, such as our recent expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and Moyock, North Carolina, our ability to maintain a level of loan production in 2017 sufficient to sustain profitability will be dependent on market factors beyond our control, such as the interest rate environment and \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n changes in interest rates, housing starts and loan demand. If mortgage interest rates continue to rise during 2017, C&F Mortgage may experience a lower loan demand, particularly for mortgage refinancings, which could negatively affect earnings of the Mortgage Banking segment in 2017. In addition, during 2017 C&F Mortgage anticipates it will continue to (i) compete to retain and attract qualified loan officers, (ii) incur costs associated with updating and enhancing our compliance management system and processes for originating residential loans to mitigate compliance and regulatory risks, as well as improving the quality of our loan origination process and (iii) utilize systems to their fullest capacity in order to realize efficiencies overall in our mortgage banking processes and to create opportunities for revenue generation. \n \u00b7 Consumer Finance: C&F Finance provides automobile financing through programs that are designed to serve customers in the non-prime market. As has been the case for the last several years, competition in the non-prime automobile loan business remains aggressive, resulting in lower interest rates and in many cases, less restrictive underwriting standards by several of our competitors. As a result, organic loan growth was difficult during 2016, and we expect organic loan growth to be equally as challenging in 2017. However, C&F Finance implemented strategic initiatives in 2016 to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition. During 2016, C&F Finance implemented a scorecard model that improved underwriting and pricing efficiencies and contributed to loan growth. We expect this model, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, will lead to loan growth in 2017. Further, we believe our scorecard model, which results in the purchase of loans with higher credit metrics, should help reduce future charge-offs at C&F Finance. However, we believe it will be challenging to maintain the Consumer Finance segment's net interest margin at its current level as competition in the non-prime market causes yields to decline and the recent increase in the federal funds rate triggers higher-costing variable-rate borrowings. During 2017, we expect to continue investing in technology at C&F Finance in order to capture more business, improve efficiencies, and manage the rigorous regulatory burdens and evolving compliance issues in the indirect auto lending industry. \nPrincipal Business Activities\nAn overview of the financial results for each of the Corporation's principal segments is presented below. A more detailed discussion is included in the section Results of Operations.\u201d\nRetail Banking: The Retail Banking segment reported net income of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income for 2016 was positively influenced by (1) the effect of loan growth on interest income, as average loans at the Retail Banking segment increased $72.9 million or 12.6 percent during 2016 over 2015, (2) an increase in non-interest income due to fees collected on loans closed under a new loan interest rate swap program initiated in 2016, (3) an increase in debit card interchange income, and (4) a lower cost of borrowings resulting from the maturity and restructuring of the Bank's higher-rate FHLB advances. Also contributing to the increase in earnings during 2016 were one-time revenue items in the second quarter of 2016 associated with a contract amendment for one of the Bank's debit card programs ($237,000 after tax), the Bank's bank-owned life insurance program ($493,000 after tax) and a gain on the sale of a Bank-owned property ($92,000 after tax). Partially offsetting these positive factors were (1) a decline in the yield on the investment portfolio due to replacing matured and called securities with lower-yielding securities, (2) a decline in the yield on loans due to the effects of the low interest rate and competitive loan environment, and (3) higher operating expenses associated with strengthening C&F Bank's technology infrastructure, growing its commercial lending teams, expanding its product offerings and promoting brand awareness.\nThe results for both 2016 and 2015 for the Retail Banking segment have been affected by the fair value accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of CVB. These adjustments resulted from marking assets and liabilities acquired from CVB to their fair values as of the acquisition date. As a result, yields on loans and investments acquired from CVB increased and the cost of certificates of deposit decreased, the benefits of which were partially offset by the (1) amortization of the core deposit intangible and (2) higher depreciation expense associated with the buildings acquired in the CVB merger. The aggregate net accretion attributable to these fair value accounting adjustments was $1.2 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.3 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Retail Banking segment's nonperforming assets were $4.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016 included $4.2 million in nonaccrual loans, compared to $6.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $195,000 in OREO, compared to $942,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2016 was primarily due to loan payoffs and transfers to OREO. The OREO decrease during 2016 was primarily due to the sale of several OREO properties and a shorter holding period for properties transferred to OREO during 2016. Management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, based on the relevant history of charge-offs and recoveries, current economic conditions, overall portfolio quality, review of specific criticized loans and other factors analyzed by management. If loan concentrations within the Bank's loan portfolio result in higher credit risk or if economic conditions decline, a higher loan loss allowance may be warranted in future periods, which may require a provision for loan losses.\nMortgage Banking: The Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The improvement in net income of the Mortgage Banking segment for 2016 resulted from an increase in the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold during 2016, compared to 2015. Loan volume increased due to successful strategic initiatives and benefited from favorable housing markets for both resale and new construction, as well as favorable interest rates. The higher loan volume resulted in higher gains on sales of loans and higher ancillary loan origination fees. These revenue increases were partially offset by higher employee compensation and loan production expenses, as well as costs associated with the mortgage banking segment's expansion into Chesapeake, Virginia and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $674.3 million from $549.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amount of loan originations during 2016 for refinancings and home purchases were $152.7 million and $521.6 million, respectively, compared to $104.4 million and $444.9 million, respectively, during 2015.\nConsumer Finance: The Consumer Finance segment reported net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in net income for 2016, compared to 2015, was principally due to an increase in the provision for loan losses from $15.5 million in 2015 to $18.0 million in 2016 because of higher net charge-offs, as discussed below, and loan growth. Partially offsetting the effect of the higher provision for loan losses was the effect on net interest income of the $13.7 million increase in average loans during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in average loans was attributable to the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2015, along with organic loan growth during 2016. C&F Finance has implemented a scorecard model that is providing underwriting efficiencies and generating more competitive pricing, which, along with personnel additions in certain major markets, led to an increase in loan originations during 2016.\nThe results of the Consumer Finance segment included an increase of $2.6 million in the provision for loan losses from 2015 to 2016. The net charge-off ratio for 2016 was 5.59 percent, compared to 5.50 percent for 2015. Loans charged off increased during 2016 because of economic and competitive factors affecting non-prime consumer finance customers. The allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to 8.40 percent at December 31, 2016, compared to 8.21 percent at December 31, 2015. Management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. If factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in a higher net charge-off ratio in the future, C&F Finance Company may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses, which could negatively affect future earnings.\nOther and Eliminations: The other segment, which principally includes the Corporation's holding company operations and wealth management subsidiary, reported an aggregate net loss of $975,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $955,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss during 2016 was due to lower earnings at the Corporation's wealth management subsidiary due to stock market volatility during"}
