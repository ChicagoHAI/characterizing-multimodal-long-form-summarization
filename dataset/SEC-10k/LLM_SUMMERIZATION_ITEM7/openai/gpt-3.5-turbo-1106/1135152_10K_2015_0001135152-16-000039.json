MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nWe design, manufacture and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers in the energy industry. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate delivery of our products, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure. Management's determination of the Company's reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources allocations to each segment.\nA description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 follows.\nWe focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use rig count as an indicator of demand which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships.\nOur Subsea Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production, including trends in shale production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our Subsea Technologies segment results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions. Our share of subsea tree awards during the year is one way we evaluate our market position.\nAs we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows.\nIn each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2015, approximately 73% of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies. We have targeted opportunities in West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region because of the expected offshore drilling potential in those regions.\nBusiness Outlook\nOverall Outlook-Along with volatility in global equity prices and exchange rates, crude oil price volatility which began in late 2014 continued throughout 2015, and as such, uncertainty regarding the short-term market fundamentals remains. This uncertainty is driven by multiple factors, including continued strength in U.S. oil production and international crude oil supply, especially from OPEC's and other major non-OPEC countries' decisions to maintain oil production levels to retain or increase their market share. The increases in global crude oil inventories in 2015 marked the second consecutive year of inventory builds and have put significant downward pressure on commodity prices. As a result of the weak crude oil price environment, many crude oil development prospects have been deferred and near-term capital spending plans of our customers have been reduced, leading to a downturn in demand for our products and services and an overall weaker demand for oilfield services. The timing of any recovery of crude oil prices is dependent on many variables, including the expected impact on supply of the relief of international sanctions on Iran's oil sector. The market corrections necessary to address the oversupply of crude oil are expected to occur over the next couple of years. Although oil companies have reduced their near-term capital investments, most of their capital spending reductions have been in capital exploration budgets that largely affect production levels beyond 2018. However, we believe as long-term demand rises and production naturally declines, commodity prices will recover and our customers will begin to increase their investments in new sources of oil production.\nSubsea Technologies-In reaction to the decline in crude oil prices, many of our customers reduced their capital spending plans in 2015 or deferred new deepwater projects. These actions had an adverse effect on our 2015 subsea inbound orders when compared to the prior year. During 2015, we reduced our workforce to maintain operating margin improvements and to align our operations with anticipated decreases in future year activity due to delayed subsea project inbound.\nGiven the lower industry expectations for 2016, we have strategically aligned our focus on certain objectives to ensure our continued success during these difficult times in our industry. These objectives include (i) the continuing improvement of our execution, (ii) the strengthening of our relationships with our customers, (iii) the timely identification of further restructuring efforts to effectively reduce costs, (iv) the employment of critical supply chain management to reduce product costs, (v) the capitalization of our subsea service offerings as a continued growth platform, and (vi) the integration of our overall product and service offerings to increase the value stream to our customers. We remain focused on ways to reduce customer costs by offering cost-effective approaches to our customers' project developments, including customer acceptance of new technologies and alternative business models to help achieve their cost-reduction goals and accelerate achievement of first oil. Many customers, including our alliance customers, are actively exploring ways to utilize our standardized subsea production equipment as operators understand the cost and scheduling benefits that standardization brings to their projects.\nAdditionally, Forsys Subsea, our joint venture with Technip, was designed to bring the proprietary technologies of FMC Technologies and Technip together to offer front-end engineering and design services aimed to identify opportunities through new technologies, services, and standardization of equipment to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development. Forsys Subsea received two integrated FEED studies during 2015, and we expect expanded interest and market acceptance in 2016.\nIn the long-term, we continue to believe deepwater development will remain a significant part of our customers' portfolio. A critical part of our long-term strategy to maintain our subsea market leadership is to continue to invest in the technologies required to develop our customers' fields and further expand our capabilities focused on increasing reservoir production over the life of the field. We believe the long-term commitment to deepwater was further exemplified during 2015 with Chevron joining our high-pressure, high-temperature joint industry program which is aimed to solve the technical and economic deepwater challenges operators currently face.\nSurface Technologies-With the decline in crude oil prices, we expected a decline in rig counts and decreased North American land activity in 2015 to negatively affect all of our Surface Technologies businesses in North America. However, customer spending reductions, coupled with increased pricing pressure, had a greater impact in our Surface Technologies businesses than in past downturns. This market environment led us to take significant actions to reduce headcount in our North American businesses in 2015. During 2015, we largely completed the reorganization within our Surface Technologies segment. This reorganization was directly aligned with our integration efforts over the last year to bring our North American surface wellhead and completion services businesses together to create our surface integrated services businesses to strengthen our market presence and bring increased value to our customers by providing an integrated offering. Although we do not expect the North American market to recover in 2016, we expect our actions to improve our position in the North American market and reduce costs in 2016. Our international surface wellhead business delivered solid operational results in 2015 due to its strong backlog, however, pricing pressure also extended to the international markets in the latter half of 2015. This pricing pressure had a slight negative effect on our 2015 international surface wellhead inbound; however we believe international activity levels to remain resilient in 2016. Given the uncertainties regarding crude oil prices and its effect on customer spending, we believe the need for further business restructuring is likely in 2016.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

by $1,579.9 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2015 included a $652.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue decreased by $927.4 million year-over-year. In Subsea Technologies, we entered 2015 with a strong backlog; however, during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, crude oil prices experienced a precipitous decline. The decline in crude oil prices had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes in our Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity. Surface Technologies posted lower revenue in 2015 driven by lower market activity in North America which decreased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business and conventional wellheads and frac-tree rental, flowback and wireline services in our surface integrated services business.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) decreased as a percentage of sales to 23.1% in 2015 from 24.5% in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower market activity in North America which decreased sales volumes in our surface integrated service business and decreased sales volumes for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business. Additionally, the market downturn in North America led us to take excess and obsolescence inventory charges in our surface integrated services, fluid control and measurement solutions businesses in 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense decreased by $122.3 million year-over-year, driven by foreign currency translation, decreased sales commissions, and costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our international surface wellhead business in the prior year.\nInformation regarding impairment and restructuring expenses recognized during 2015 is incorporated herein by reference from Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected foreign currency losses in 2015 primarily related to the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. In 2014, other income (expense), net reflected foreign currency losses primarily related to a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 21.5% and 34.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to a favorable change in mix of earnings, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for certain intercompany interest costs and a settlement of an IRS audit. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 in Singapore and 2017 and 2020 in Malaysia. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nRevenue increased by $816.4 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2014 included a $218.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $1,034.8 million year-over-year. Subsea systems and services had another solid year of order activity in 2014. The impact of higher backlog coming into 2014, combined with strong market activity, led to increased Subsea Technologies sales year-over-year. Surface Technologies posted higher revenue in 2014 due to conventional wellhead system sales in our surface integrated services and international surface wellhead businesses and due to increased sales in our fluid control business as demand for our well service pumps and flowline products recovered from the slowdown of the North American shale markets experienced in the prior year.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 24.5% in 2014 from 21.8% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher margin backlog conversion in our Western Region subsea business, higher volumes in subsea services across all regions and the remeasurement of the Multi Phase Meters earn-out consideration in 2013, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment. Additionally, gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of higher volumes and higher margin projects in our international surface wellhead business, primarily in the Middle East and Europe, and due to increased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business.\nSG&A expense increased by $55.8 million year-over-year, driven by higher project tendering costs and reorganization expenses in our subsea business, increased sales commissions, costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our surface wellhead business and bonus accruals.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2014. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 34.0% and 29.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding a retroactive benefit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 recorded in the first quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate was 30.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2014 from the adjusted rate in 2013 was primarily due to changes in Norwegian tax law effective from 2014 and an unfavorable change in mix of earnings. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 and 2015, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\nOPERATING RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\nSegment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses. The following items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, net interest income (expense) associated with corporate debt facilities, income taxes, and other revenue and other expense, net. Information about amounts included in corporate items and a reconciliation of segment operating results to consolidated income before income taxes, is incorporated herein by reference from Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe report our results of operations in U.S. dollars; however, our earnings are generated in various currencies worldwide. For example, we generate a significant amount of revenue, and incur a significant amount of costs, in Norwegian krone, Brazilian real, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, British pound, Angolan new kwanza and the euro. In order to provide worldwide consolidated results, the earnings of subsidiaries functioning in their local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon the average exchange rate during the period. While the U.S. dollar results reported reflect the actual economics of the period reported upon, the variances from prior periods include the impact of translating earnings at different rates.\nSubsea Technologies\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable/(Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,509.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,726.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(757.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(118.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit as a percent of revenue\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2) pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6 pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSubsea Technologies' revenue decreased $757.4 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. Revenue for 2015 included a $540.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily as a result of the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenue decreased by $216.8 million during 2015 compared to the prior year. We entered 2015 with a strong backlog; however, during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, crude oil prices experienced a precipitous decline. The decline in crude oil price had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes in our Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit totaled $630.2 million, or 14.0% of revenue, in 2015, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 14.2%. The margin decline was primarily driven by the following:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subsea Systems - 0.5 percentage point increase due to higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business, partially offset by restructuring and severance charges in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters - 0.8 percentage point decrease due to the decline in crude oil price and its related effect on market activity in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Subsea Technologies' operating profit in 2015 included a $77.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and $49.7 million in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nSubsea Technologies' revenue increased $539.5 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue for 2014 included a $178.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenue increased by $718.0 million during 2014 compared to the prior year. We entered 2014 with a strong backlog. During the first half of 2014, high crude oil prices led to solid oil and gas exploration and production activity when compared to the prior year; however, a decline in oil prices that began in mid-2014 and which significantly further declined in the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected the subsea market. Despite the late 2014 decline in crude oil prices, we had solid order activity during 2014 from high demand for subsea systems and services. The year-over-year increase in revenue was attributable to the conversion of backlog and solid order activity in 2014.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit totaled $748.2 million, or 14.2% of revenue, in 2014, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 11.6%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by our Western Region subsea business from higher margin project backlog conversion and higher volumes in subsea services, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit in 2014 included a $24.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nSurface Technologies\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable/(Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,487.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,130.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,806.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(643.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(332.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit as a percent of revenue\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3) pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2 pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSurface Technologies' revenue decreased $643.1 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.

Order backlog at December 31, 2015, decreased by $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower inbound orders during 2015 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies backlog of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2015, was composed of various subsea projects, including BP's Mad Dog Phase 2 and Shah Deniz Stage 2; Chevron's Agbami; Eni's Block 15/06 East Hub and Jangkrik; Petrobras' pre-salt tree and manifold award; Shell's Appomattox; Statoil's Johan Sverdrup Phase 1; Total's Egina; Tullow Ghana's TEN; Wintershall's Maria; and Woodside's Greater Western Flank Phase 2. The above listed projects represented 73% of our Subsea Technologies backlog as of December 31, 2015. We expect to convert approximately 55% to 60% of December 31, 2015 backlog into revenue during 2016.\nSurface Technologies. Order backlog at December 31, 2015 decreased by $221.4 million compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease in backlog was due to lower inbound orders primarily in our fluid control and surface integrated services businesses during 2015. We expect to convert substantially all December 31, 2015 backlog into revenue into 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSubstantially all of our cash balances are held outside the United States and are generally used to meet the liquidity needs of our non-U.S. operations. Most of our cash held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but under current law, any such repatriation would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as adjusted for applicable foreign tax credits. We have provided for U.S. federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings where we have determined that such earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.\nWe expect to meet the continuing funding requirements of our U.S. operations with cash generated by such U.S. operations, cash from earnings generated by non-U.S. operations that are not indefinitely reinvested and our existing revolving credit facility. If cash held by non-U.S. operations is required for funding operations in the United States, and if U.S. tax has not previously been provided on the earnings of such operations, we would make a provision for additional U.S. tax in connection with repatriating this cash, which may be material to our cash flows and results of operations.\nNet debt, or net cash, is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our capital structure and financial leverage. We believe net debt, or net cash, is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure. Net (debt) cash should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash and cash equivalents as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our cash and cash equivalents to net (debt) cash for the periods presented.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>916.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>638.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>(21.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td>(1,134.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,293.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(239.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(666.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in our net debt position was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, positive changes in our working capital position, and decreased treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities from lower income from operations and cash requirements to fund our joint ventures.\nCash Flows\nCash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, were as follows:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>892.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash required by investing activities\n</td> <td>(275.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(285.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(311.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash required by financing activities\n</td> <td>(345.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(355.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(422.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(34.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating cash flows-During 2015, we generated $932.4 million in cash flows from operating activities, which represented a $39.9 million increase compared to the prior year. Our cash flows from operating activities in 2014 were $97.1 million higher than 2013. The year-over-year increase in 2015 was due to a positive change in our working capital position driven by our portfolio of projects resulting from collections of receivables, partially offset by lower income during the year. The year-over-year increase in 2014 was due to higher income during the year, partially offset by a negative change in our working capital position driven by our portfolio of projects resulting from significant advance payments received in 2013. Our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment terms and timing on key contracts.\nInvesting cash flows-Our cash requirements for investing activities in 2015 were $275.2 million, primarily reflecting cash required by our capital expenditure program of $250.8 million during 2015 related to continued investments in service asset primarily in our Subsea Technologies segment and $34.5 million in investments in our Forsys Subsea and FTO Services joint ventures.\nOur cash requirements for investing activities in 2014 were $285.1 million, primarily reflecting cash required by our capital expenditure program of $404.4 million related to continued investments in capacity expansion and service asset investments primarily in our Subsea Technologies segment, partially offset by $105.6 million of proceeds related to the sale of our Material Handling Products business in the second quarter of 2014.\nOur cash requirements for investing activities in 2013 were $311.6 million, primarily reflecting cash required by our capital expenditure program of $314.1 million related to continued investments in capacity expansion and service asset investments primarily in our Subsea Technologies segment.\nFinancing cash flows-Cash required by financing activities was $345.6 million in 2015. The decrease in cash required from financing activities from the prior year was driven by decreased purchases of treasury stock in 2015 and the payment of the Multi Phase Meters earn-out obligation in 2014, partially offset by higher payments to reduce our commercial paper position in 2015.\nCash required by financing activities was $355.4 million in 2014. The decrease in cash required from financing activities from the prior year was driven by higher payments to reduce our commercial paper position in 2013, payment of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility in 2013, partially offset by increased purchases of treasury stock during 2014.\nDebt and Liquidity\nTotal borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014, comprised the following:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>337.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.00% Notes due 2017\n</td> <td>299.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.45% Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>497.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign uncommitted credit facilities\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property financing\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,156.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,305.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility-On September 24, 2015, we entered into a new $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement ( credit agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The credit agreement is a five-year, revolving credit facility expiring in September 2020. Subject to certain conditions, at our request the aggregate commitments under the credit agreement may be increased by an additional $500 million.\nBorrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the highest of three base rates or the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d), at our option, plus an applicable margin. Depending on our senior unsecured credit rating, the applicable margin for revolving loans varies (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, from 1.00% to 1.75% and (ii) in the case of base rate loans, from 0.00% to 0.75%.\nIn connection with the new credit agreement, we terminated our previously existing $1.5 billion five-year, revolving credit agreement.\nThe following is a summary of our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\nDescription\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial\nPaper\nOutstanding\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Letters\nof Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unused\nCapacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five-year revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,662.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 2020\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Under our commercial paper program, we have the ability to access up to $1.5 billion of financing through our commercial paper dealers.

We had $337.2 million of commercial paper issued under our facility at December 31, 2015. As we had both the ability and intent to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, our commercial paper borrowings were classified as long-term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nAmong other restrictions, the terms of the credit agreement include negative covenants related to liens and our total capitalization ratio. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility.\nSenior Notes-On September 21, 2012, we completed the public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes due October 2017 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due October 2022 (collectively, the Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2013. Net proceeds from the offering of $793.8 million were used for the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. Additional information about the Senior Notes is incorporated herein by reference from Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook for 2016\nLiquidity and Capital Resources-Historically, we have generated our liquidity and capital resources primarily through operations and, when needed, through our credit facility. We have $1,662.8 million in capacity available under our revolving credit facility that we expect to utilize if working capital needs temporarily increase in response to changes in market demand. The volatility in credit, equity and commodity markets creates some uncertainty for our businesses. Although we will continue to reach payment milestones on many of our projects, we expect our consolidated operating cash flow position in 2016 to decrease as a result of the negative impact the decline in commodity prices will have on our overall business. The downturn in the oilfield services industry as a result of the decrease in commodity prices has led some of our customers to request price concessions or delays in backlog delivery. Consequently, any discounts or material product delivery delays that may ultimately be mutually agreed with our customers may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. However, management believes, based on our current financial condition, existing backlog levels and current expectations for future market conditions, that we will continue to meet our short- and long-term liquidity needs with a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and access to capital markets.\nThe term loan supporting our Brazilian operations matures in 2016; however, we expect to re-finance this obligation during 2016.\nWe expect to make contributions of approximately $12.7 million to our international pension plans during 2016. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. We update our pension estimates annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. Additionally, we expect to make contributions of approximately $3.7 million to our U.S. Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan during 2016.\nWe project spending approximately $180 million in 2016 for capital expenditures, largely towards maintenance expenditures in our subsea service business. Further, we expect to continue our stock repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors, with the timing and amounts of these repurchases dependent upon market conditions and liquidity.\nWe continue to evaluate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures that meet our strategic priorities. Our intent is to maintain a level of financing sufficient to meet these objectives.\nCredit rating-Due to the deterioration in crude oil prices, Moody's has placed many U.S. exploration and production and oilfield service companies, including FMC Technologies, on review for downgrade. Should a downgrade occur, we believe it is reasonably likely to affect our borrowing costs related to our commercial paper program; however, we are currently unable to estimate the incremental borrowing costs under our commercial paper program during 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\nContractual obligations\n</td> <td>Total\npayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 -5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>636.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (b)\n</td> <td>421.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (c)\n</td> <td>602.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and other post-retirement benefits (d)\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (e)\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,334.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Our available long-term debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants, including negative covenants related to liens and our total capitalization ratio.

Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements address all important accounting areas where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nPercentage of Completion Method of Accounting\nWe recognize revenue on construction-type manufacturing projects using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. There are several acceptable methods under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles of measuring progress toward completion. Most frequently, we use the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion to measure progress toward completion.\nWe execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment, systems and/or services that we will provide and the amount of consideration we will receive. After analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements, our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project, such as technical risks associated with a new design. Costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions arising from these specific risks will affect our total cost to complete the project. After work on a project begins, assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a regular basis and our estimates are updated to reflect the most current information and management's best judgment.\nRevenue recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting was approximately 60%, 52% and 55% of total revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A significant portion of our total revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting relates to our Subsea Technologies segment, primarily for subsea exploration and production equipment projects that involve the design, engineering, manufacturing and assembly of complex, customer-specific systems. The systems are not entirely built from standard bills of material and typically require extended periods of time to design and construct.\nTotal estimated contract cost affects both the revenue recognized in a period as well as the reported profit or loss on a project. The determination of profit or loss on a contract requires consideration of contract revenue, change orders and claims, less costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Adjustments to estimates of contract revenue, total contract cost, or extent of progress toward completion are often required as work progresses under the contract and as experience is gained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. The nature of accounting for contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Consequently, the amount of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting is sensitive to changes in our estimates of total contract costs. For each contract in progress at December 31, 2015, a 1% increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre-tax income by $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe total estimated contract cost in the percentage of completion method of accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect revenue and profit and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain. There are many factors, including, but not limited to, the ability to properly execute the engineering and designing phases consistent with our customers' expectations, the availability and costs of labor and material resources, productivity and weather, that can affect the accuracy of our cost estimates, and ultimately, our future profitability. In the past, we have realized both lower and higher than expected margins and have incurred losses as a result of unforeseen changes in our project costs; however, historically, our estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenue and profit on contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. We evaluate the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess and obsolescence. We record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period in which it is identified. Our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period. In addition, the estimate requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory.\nIn order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory, we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have a quantity on hand in excess of usage within the most recent two-year period. The list is reviewed with sales, engineering, production and materials management personnel to determine whether the list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate. As part of this evaluation, management considers whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods, whether there will be future demand for on-hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology. Finally, an assessment is made of our historical usage of inventory previously written off as excess or obsolete, and a further adjustment to the estimate is made based on this historical experience. As a result, our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future usage of inventory. Factors that could materially impact our estimate include changes in crude oil prices and its effect on the longevity of the current industry downturn, which would impact the demand for our products and services, as well as changes in the pattern of demand for the products that we offer. We believe our inventory valuation reserve is adequate to properly value potential excess and obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2015, however, any significant changes to the factors mentioned above could lead our estimate to change. Refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to inventory valuation adjustments recorded during 2015.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future productivity of the asset, operating costs and capital decisions and all available information at the date of review. During 2015, we identified various assets whose carrying values were impaired due to the downturn in the oilfield services industry, driven by the decline in crude oil prices. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to asset impairment charges recorded during 2015. If future market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations and assumptions, additional impairments of long-lived assets may be identified if we conclude that the carrying amounts are no longer recoverable.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have established October 31 as the date of our annual test for impairment of goodwill. Reporting units with goodwill are tested for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, or based on management's judgment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.\nWhen using the two-step quantitative impairment test, determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model. The majority of the estimates and assumptions used in a discounted future cash flow model involve unobservable inputs reflecting management's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of a business. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nAt December 31, 2015, recorded goodwill of $63.7 million was associated with our U.S. surface integrated services reporting unit. The decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 has introduced uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions used in estimating fair value of the reporting unit. Depressed crude oil and natural gas prices for a prolonged period of time may adversely affect the economics of our customers' projects, particularly shale-related projects in North America, which may lead to the reduction in demand for our products and services, negatively impacting the financial results of the reporting unit. Our estimate of fair value for the U.S. surface integrated services reporting unit relies on third party forecasts of the number of hydraulic fracturing stages expected to be completed as well as the expected recovery of the overall North American oil and gas market. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil and natural gas prices, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for U.S. surface integrated services, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2015, recorded goodwill of $54.7 million was associated with our separation systems reporting unit. The decline in crude oil prices and its related effect on customer capital spending has led to negative margins for separation systems in 2015. Our estimate of fair value for the separation systems reporting unit relies on assumptions of lower oil and gas activity over the next few years with expected market recovery in 2019 for this business. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices, management is expanding the reporting unit's existing product offering in both greenfield and brownfield applications by introducing differentiating technology and expanding the system and solutions business as a growth platform. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil prices and changes in customer capital spending, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for separation systems, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2014, we determined the fair values of our heritage completion services and automation and control reporting units did not substantially exceed their carrying values. As a result, we conducted interim goodwill impairments tests for both these reporting units during the first and second quarter in 2015. As part of management's strategy to integrate our products and services in our Surface Technologies segment, the services of our completion services reporting unit became part of our U.S. and Canadian surface integrated services reporting units during the third quarter of 2015. Refer to Part I, Item 1 Business\u201d for further information regarding these integration efforts. A goodwill impairment charge of $8.4 million related to our Canadian surface integrated services reporting unit was recorded in our Surface Technologies segment during the third quarter of 2015 as a result of the continued deterioration in crude oil prices and its related effect on demand for services of the reporting unit. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to asset impairment charges recorded in 2015. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment during 2014, as the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill balances exceeded their carrying amounts. In addition, there were no negative conditions, or triggering events, that occurred in 2014 requiring us to perform additional impairment reviews.\nA lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units, specifically our U.S. surface integrated services and separation systems reporting units, could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines of the reporting unit's products and services, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, changes in customer demand, and other changes in market conditions, which may affect certain market participant assumptions used in the discounted future cash flow model.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense.\nIn determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent we believe recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and finally, the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.\nForecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We develop our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments' performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches and customer sales commitments. Significant changes in the expected realizability of a deferred tax asset would require that we adjust the valuation allowance applied against the gross value of our total deferred tax assets, resulting in a change to net income.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we have cumulative net operating losses and, therefore, we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2015, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income in the United States to utilize our domestic deferred tax assets. Therefore, we have not provided a valuation allowance against any domestic deferred tax assets.\nThe need for a valuation allowance is sensitive to changes in our estimate of future taxable income. If our estimate of future taxable income was 25% lower than the estimate used, we would still generate sufficient taxable income to utilize such domestic deferred tax assets.\nThe calculation of our income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits. We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expense in the periods in which they are determined.\nAccounting for Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nOur pension and other post-retirement (health care and life insurance) obligations are described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe determination of the projected benefit obligations of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are important to the recorded amounts of such obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and to the amount of pension expense in our consolidated statements of income. In order to measure the obligations and expense associated with our pension benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty and difficulty in estimating these measures. Different estimates used by management could result in our recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time.\nDue to the specialized and statistical nature of these calculations which attempt to anticipate future events, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these pension benefits. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are primarily based on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets, respectively. These measures are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management's judgment and can materially affect net income.\nThe discount rate affects the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost and the calculation of the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is based on rates at which the pension benefit obligation could be effectively settled on a present value basis. Discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of long-term, high quality ( AA\u201d rated) corporate bonds at our determination date that is sufficient to provide for the projected pension benefit payments. A single discount rate is determined that results in a discounted value of the pension benefit payments that equate to the market value of the selected bonds. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the pension's distinct liability characteristics. Significant changes in the discount rate, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and the timing of expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in our pension expense and pension liabilities.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component of net periodic pension cost. Our estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the historical performance of plan assets, current market conditions, our asset allocation and long-term growth expectations. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the expected remaining service life of employees, resulting in a lag time between the market's performance and its impact on plan results.\nHolding other assumptions constant, the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets on pension expense and the projected benefit obligation:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except basis points)\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in 2015 Pension Expense Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 basis point decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 basis point increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe actuarial assumptions and estimates made by management in determining our pension benefit obligations may materially differ from actual results as a result of changing market and economic conditions and changes in plan participant assumptions. While we believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in plan participant assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations.\nOther Matters\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2014, we received an inquiry and a subpoena from the SEC seeking information about paid-time-off accruals within the automation and control business unit. The inquiry continued into the second half of 2014 and covered revenue and expenses in certain business units. Pursuant to additional subpoenas received in 2015, we provided information regarding our tax department and our previously disclosed accounting treatment for uncertain foreign tax positions.\nWe have fully responded to all of the SEC's requests for information and have cooperated and engaged in discussions with the SEC. On January 19, 2016, we received a notice indicating that the SEC had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC Division of Enforcement file a civil enforcement action against the Company for alleged violations of the reporting, books-and-records and internal control provisions of U.S. securities laws. We believe that no enforcement action is warranted against us, and we intend to vigorously defend any claims that may be brought. We have discussed these matters with our independent registered public accounting firm and our Audit Committee.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations for a company in the energy industry, including the segments Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies, and Energy Infrastructure. It identifies factors affecting the segments, such as changes in oil and gas prices, global economic outlook, and customer relationships, and provides an outlook for future performance based on industry trends. The report also details the revenue and operating profit of each segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, and explains the factors influencing the changes in revenue and profit for each segment during these periods. The Surface Technologies segment experienced a decrease in revenue and operating profit due to lower market activity in North America, while the Subsea Technologies segment faced similar challenges arising from the decline in crude oil prices and market activity. The Energy Infrastructure segment's performance also declined due to lower sales volumes. Overall, the company faced challenges related to macroeconomic factors and reduced demand for its products and services.", "item_7_tables": "Table 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nWe design, manufacture and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers in the energy industry. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate delivery of our products, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure. Management's determination of the Company's reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources allocations to each segment.\nA description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 follows.\nWe focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use rig count as an indicator of demand which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships.\nOur Subsea Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production, including trends in shale production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our Subsea Technologies segment results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions. Our share of subsea tree awards during the year is one way we evaluate our market position.\nAs we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows.\nIn each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2015, approximately 73% of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies. We have targeted opportunities in West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region because of the expected offshore drilling potential in those regions.\nBusiness Outlook\nOverall Outlook-Along with volatility in global equity prices and exchange rates, crude oil price volatility which began in late 2014 continued throughout 2015, and as such, uncertainty regarding the short-term market fundamentals remains. This uncertainty is driven by multiple factors, including continued strength in U.S. oil production and international crude oil supply, especially from OPEC's and other major non-OPEC countries' decisions to maintain oil production levels to retain or increase their market share. The increases in global crude oil inventories in 2015 marked the second consecutive year of inventory builds and have put significant downward pressure on commodity prices. As a result of the weak crude oil price environment, many crude oil development prospects have been deferred and near-term capital spending plans of our customers have been reduced, leading to a downturn in demand for our products and services and an overall weaker demand for oilfield services. The timing of any recovery of crude oil prices is dependent on many variables, including the expected impact on supply of the relief of international sanctions on Iran's oil sector. The market corrections necessary to address the oversupply of crude oil are expected to occur over the next couple of years. Although oil companies have reduced their near-term capital investments, most of their capital spending reductions have been in capital exploration budgets that largely affect production levels beyond 2018. However, we believe as long-term demand rises and production naturally declines, commodity prices will recover and our customers will begin to increase their investments in new sources of oil production.\nSubsea Technologies-In reaction to the decline in crude oil prices, many of our customers reduced their capital spending plans in 2015 or deferred new deepwater projects. These actions had an adverse effect on our 2015 subsea inbound orders when compared to the prior year. During 2015, we reduced our workforce to maintain operating margin improvements and to align our operations with anticipated decreases in future year activity due to delayed subsea project inbound.\nGiven the lower industry expectations for 2016, we have strategically aligned our focus on certain objectives to ensure our continued success during these difficult times in our industry. These objectives include (i) the continuing improvement of our execution, (ii) the strengthening of our relationships with our customers, (iii) the timely identification of further restructuring efforts to effectively reduce costs, (iv) the employment of critical supply chain management to reduce product costs, (v) the capitalization of our subsea service offerings as a continued growth platform, and (vi) the integration of our overall product and service offerings to increase the value stream to our customers. We remain focused on ways to reduce customer costs by offering cost-effective approaches to our customers' project developments, including customer acceptance of new technologies and alternative business models to help achieve their cost-reduction goals and accelerate achievement of first oil. Many customers, including our alliance customers, are actively exploring ways to utilize our standardized subsea production equipment as operators understand the cost and scheduling benefits that standardization brings to their projects.\nAdditionally, Forsys Subsea, our joint venture with Technip, was designed to bring the proprietary technologies of FMC Technologies and Technip together to offer front-end engineering and design services aimed to identify opportunities through new technologies, services, and standardization of equipment to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development. Forsys Subsea received two integrated FEED studies during 2015, and we expect expanded interest and market acceptance in 2016.\nIn the long-term, we continue to believe deepwater development will remain a significant part of our customers' portfolio. A critical part of our long-term strategy to maintain our subsea market leadership is to continue to invest in the technologies required to develop our customers' fields and further expand our capabilities focused on increasing reservoir production over the life of the field. We believe the long-term commitment to deepwater was further exemplified during 2015 with Chevron joining our high-pressure, high-temperature joint industry program which is aimed to solve the technical and economic deepwater challenges operators currently face.\nSurface Technologies-With the decline in crude oil prices, we expected a decline in rig counts and decreased North American land activity in 2015 to negatively affect all of our Surface Technologies businesses in North America. However, customer spending reductions, coupled with increased pricing pressure, had a greater impact in our Surface Technologies businesses than in past downturns. This market environment led us to take significant actions to reduce headcount in our North American businesses in 2015. During 2015, we largely completed the reorganization within our Surface Technologies segment. This reorganization was directly aligned with our integration efforts over the last year to bring our North American surface wellhead and completion services businesses together to create our surface integrated services businesses to strengthen our market presence and bring increased value to our customers by providing an integrated offering. Although we do not expect the North American market to recover in 2016, we expect our actions to improve our position in the North American market and reduce costs in 2016. Our international surface wellhead business delivered solid operational results in 2015 due to its strong backlog, however, pricing pressure also extended to the international markets in the latter half of 2015. This pricing pressure had a slight negative effect on our 2015 international surface wellhead inbound; however we believe international activity levels to remain resilient in 2016. Given the uncertainties regarding crude oil prices and its effect on customer spending, we believe the need for further business restructuring is likely in 2016.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013\n\n_______________________\n*Not meaningful\n2015 Compared With 2014\nRevenue decreased by $1,579.9 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2015 included a $652.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue decreased by $927.4 million year-over-year. In Subsea Technologies, we entered 2015 with a strong backlog; however, during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, crude oil prices experienced a precipitous decline. The decline in crude oil prices had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes in our Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity. Surface Technologies posted lower revenue in 2015 driven by lower market activity in North America which decreased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business and conventional wellheads and frac-tree rental, flowback and wireline services in our surface integrated services business.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) decreased as a percentage of sales to 23.1% in 2015 from 24.5% in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower market activity in North America which decreased sales volumes in our surface integrated service business and decreased sales volumes for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business. Additionally, the market downturn in North America led us to take excess and obsolescence inventory charges in our surface integrated services, fluid control and measurement solutions businesses in 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense decreased by $122.3 million year-over-year, driven by foreign currency translation, decreased sales commissions, and costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our international surface wellhead business in the prior year.\nInformation regarding impairment and restructuring expenses recognized during 2015 is incorporated herein by reference from Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected foreign currency losses in 2015 primarily related to the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. In 2014, other income (expense), net reflected foreign currency losses primarily related to a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 21.5% and 34.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to a favorable change in mix of earnings, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for certain intercompany interest costs and a settlement of an IRS audit. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 in Singapore and 2017 and 2020 in Malaysia. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nRevenue increased by $816.4 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2014 included a $218.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $1,034.8 million year-over-year. Subsea systems and services had another solid year of order activity in 2014. The impact of higher backlog coming into 2014, combined with strong market activity, led to increased Subsea Technologies sales year-over-year. Surface Technologies posted higher revenue in 2014 due to conventional wellhead system sales in our surface integrated services and international surface wellhead businesses and due to increased sales in our fluid control business as demand for our well service pumps and flowline products recovered from the slowdown of the North American shale markets experienced in the prior year.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 24.5% in 2014 from 21.8% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher margin backlog conversion in our Western Region subsea business, higher volumes in subsea services across all regions and the remeasurement of the Multi Phase Meters earn-out consideration in 2013, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment. Additionally, gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of higher volumes and higher margin projects in our international surface wellhead business, primarily in the Middle East and Europe, and due to increased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business.\nSG&A expense increased by $55.8 million year-over-year, driven by higher project tendering costs and reorganization expenses in our subsea business, increased sales commissions, costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our surface wellhead business and bonus accruals.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2014. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 34.0% and 29.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding a retroactive benefit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 recorded in the first quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate was 30.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2014 from the adjusted rate in 2013 was primarily due to changes in Norwegian tax law effective from 2014 and an unfavorable change in mix of earnings. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 and 2015, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\nOPERATING RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\nSegment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses. The following items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, net interest income (expense) associated with corporate debt facilities, income taxes, and other revenue and other expense, net. Information about amounts included in corporate items and a reconciliation of segment operating results to consolidated income before income taxes, is incorporated herein by reference from Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe report our results of operations in U.S. dollars; however, our earnings are generated in various currencies worldwide. For example, we generate a significant amount of revenue, and incur a significant amount of costs, in Norwegian krone, Brazilian real, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, British pound, Angolan new kwanza and the euro. In order to provide worldwide consolidated results, the earnings of subsidiaries functioning in their local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon the average exchange rate during the period. While the U.S. dollar results reported reflect the actual economics of the period reported upon, the variances from prior periods include the impact of translating earnings at different rates.\nSubsea Technologies\n\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSubsea Technologies' revenue decreased $757.4 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. Revenue for 2015 included a $540.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily as a result of the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenue decreased by $216.8 million during 2015 compared to the prior year. We entered 2015 with a strong backlog; however, during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, crude oil prices experienced a precipitous decline. The decline in crude oil price had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes in our Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit totaled $630.2 million, or 14.0% of revenue, in 2015, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 14.2%. The margin decline was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Subsea Systems - 0.5 percentage point increase due to higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business, partially offset by restructuring and severance charges in 2015; and \n \u2022 Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters - 0.8 percentage point decrease due to the decline in crude oil price and its related effect on market activity in 2015.  Subsea Technologies' operating profit in 2015 included a $77.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and $49.7 million in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nSubsea Technologies' revenue increased $539.5 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue for 2014 included a $178.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenue increased by $718.0 million during 2014 compared to the prior year. We entered 2014 with a strong backlog. During the first half of 2014, high crude oil prices led to solid oil and gas exploration and production activity when compared to the prior year; however, a decline in oil prices that began in mid-2014 and which significantly further declined in the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected the subsea market. Despite the late 2014 decline in crude oil prices, we had solid order activity during 2014 from high demand for subsea systems and services. The year-over-year increase in revenue was attributable to the conversion of backlog and solid order activity in 2014.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit totaled $748.2 million, or 14.2% of revenue, in 2014, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 11.6%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by our Western Region subsea business from higher margin project backlog conversion and higher volumes in subsea services, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit in 2014 included a $24.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nSurface Technologies\n\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSurface Technologies' revenue decreased $643.1 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower market activity in North America which decreased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business and conventional wellheads in our surface integrated services business. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by $74.3 million in 2015.\nSurface Technologies' operating profit totaled $60.6 million, or 4.1% of revenue, in 2015, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 18.4%. The margin decline was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Surface Integrated Services - 10.2 percentage point decrease due to $59.0 million in asset impairment charges primarily in Canada, excess and obsolescence inventory charges, and lower market activity in North America; and \n \u2022 Fluid Control - 5.6 percentage point decrease due to decreased sales volumes for our well service pumps and flowline products resulting from lower activity in the North American shale markets and related excess and obsolescence inventory charges and restructuring expense.  Surface Technologies' operating profit in 2015 included a $7.6 million favorable impact of foreign currency translation, $73.7 million in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges, and $41.1 million in excess and obsolescence inventory charges.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nSurface Technologies' revenue increased $323.9 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by growth in our international surface wellhead business, primarily in the Middle East and Europe regions, and higher activity in the North American shale markets which drove additional demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by $35.9 million in 2014.\nSurface Technologies' operating profit totaled $393.0 million, or 18.4% of revenue, in 2014, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 14.2%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Surface Wellhead International - 1.9 percentage point increase due to higher volumes and higher margin projects in the Middle East and Europe regions; and \n \u2022 Fluid Control - 1.8 percentage point increase due to increased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products resulting from the improved North American shale markets in 2014. \nEnergy Infrastructure\n\n2015 Compared With 2014\nEnergy Infrastructure's revenue decreased $162.0 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue was due to lower sales volumes primarily in our measurement solutions business driven by the market downturn in 2015. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by $38.7 million in 2015.\nEnergy Infrastructure's operating profit totaled $3.2 million, or 0.8% of revenue, in 2015, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The margin decline was primarily driven by a 6.5 percentage point decrease in our measurement solutions business as a result of lower sales volumes due to the market downturn in 2015 and restructuring expense, severance charges and excess and obsolescence inventory charges recorded in 2015. Energy Infrastructure's operating profit in 2015 included $8.5 million in restructuring and other severance charges and $7.4 million in excess and obsolescence inventory charges.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nEnergy Infrastructure's revenue decreased $59.8 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue was due to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nWe design, manufacture and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers in the energy industry. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate delivery of our products, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure. Management's determination of the Company's reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources allocations to each segment.\nA description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 follows.\nWe focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use rig count as an indicator of demand which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships.\nOur Subsea Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production, including trends in shale production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our Subsea Technologies segment results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions. Our share of subsea tree awards during the year is one way we evaluate our market position.\nAs we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows.\nIn each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2015, approximately 73% of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies. We have targeted opportunities in West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region because of the expected offshore drilling potential in those regions.\nBusiness Outlook\nOverall Outlook-Along with volatility in global equity prices and exchange rates, crude oil price volatility which began in late 2014 continued throughout 2015, and as such, uncertainty regarding the short-term market fundamentals remains.

by $1,579.9 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2015 included a $652.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue decreased by $927.4 million year-over-year. In Subsea Technologies, we entered 2015 with a strong backlog; however, during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, crude oil prices experienced a precipitous decline. The decline in crude oil prices had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower sales volumes in our Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity. Surface Technologies posted lower revenue in 2015 driven by lower market activity in North America which decreased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business and conventional wellheads and frac-tree rental, flowback and wireline services in our surface integrated services business.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) decreased as a percentage of sales to 23.1% in 2015 from 24.5% in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower market activity in North America which decreased sales volumes in our surface integrated service business and decreased sales volumes for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business. Additionally, the market downturn in North America led us to take excess and obsolescence inventory charges in our surface integrated services, fluid control and measurement solutions businesses in 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense decreased by $122.3 million year-over-year, driven by foreign currency translation, decreased sales commissions, and costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our international surface wellhead business in the prior year.\nInformation regarding impairment and restructuring expenses recognized during 2015 is incorporated herein by reference from Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected foreign currency losses in 2015 primarily related to the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. In 2014, other income (expense), net reflected foreign currency losses primarily related to a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 21.5% and 34.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to a favorable change in mix of earnings, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for certain intercompany interest costs and a settlement of an IRS audit. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 in Singapore and 2017 and 2020 in Malaysia. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nRevenue increased by $816.4 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue in 2014 included a $218.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue increased by $1,034.8 million year-over-year. Subsea systems and services had another solid year of order activity in 2014. The impact of higher backlog coming into 2014, combined with strong market activity, led to increased Subsea Technologies sales year-over-year. Surface Technologies posted higher revenue in 2014 due to conventional wellhead system sales in our surface integrated services and international surface wellhead businesses and due to increased sales in our fluid control business as demand for our well service pumps and flowline products recovered from the slowdown of the North American shale markets experienced in the prior year.\nGross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 24.5% in 2014 from 21.8% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher margin backlog conversion in our Western Region subsea business, higher volumes in subsea services across all regions and the remeasurement of the Multi Phase Meters earn-out consideration in 2013, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment. Additionally, gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of higher volumes and higher margin projects in our international surface wellhead business, primarily in the Middle East and Europe, and due to increased demand for our well service pumps and flowline products in our fluid control business.\nSG&A expense increased by $55.8 million year-over-year, driven by higher project tendering costs and reorganization expenses in our subsea business, increased sales commissions, costs associated with terminating a representative agreement in our surface wellhead business and bonus accruals.\nDuring 2014 we recognized a net $84.3 million gain on the sale of our Material Handling Products business. Further information of the sale is incorporated herein by reference from Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net, reflected a $33.4 million loss related to the remeasurement of an intercompany foreign currency transaction and other foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2014. Further discussion of our derivative instruments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 34.0% and 29.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding a retroactive benefit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 recorded in the first quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate was 30.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2014 from the adjusted rate in 2013 was primarily due to changes in Norwegian tax law effective from 2014 and an unfavorable change in mix of earnings. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, since our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower tax rates than in the United States. In certain jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, our tax rate is significantly less than the relevant statutory rate due to tax holidays which are set to expire after 2018 and 2015, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily related to differing foreign and state tax rates.\nOPERATING RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\nSegment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses. The following items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, net interest income (expense) associated with corporate debt facilities, income taxes, and other revenue and other expense, net. Information about amounts included in corporate items and a reconciliation of segment operating results to consolidated income before income taxes, is incorporated herein by reference from Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe report our results of operations in U.S. dollars; however, our earnings are generated in various currencies worldwide. For example, we generate a significant amount of revenue, and incur a significant amount of costs, in Norwegian krone, Brazilian real, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, British pound, Angolan new kwanza and the euro. In order to provide worldwide consolidated results, the earnings of subsidiaries functioning in their local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon the average exchange rate during the period. While the U.S. dollar results reported reflect the actual economics of the period reported upon, the variances from prior periods include the impact of translating earnings at different rates.\nSubsea Technologies\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable/(Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,509.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,726.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(757.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(118.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit as a percent of revenue\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2) pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6 pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSubsea Technologies' revenue decreased $757.4 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.

The margin decline was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Subsea Systems - 0.5 percentage point increase due to higher margin project backlog conversion in our Western Region and Asia Pacific subsea business, partially offset by restructuring and severance charges in 2015; and \n \u2022 Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters - 0.8 percentage point decrease due to the decline in crude oil price and its related effect on market activity in 2015.  Subsea Technologies' operating profit in 2015 included a $77.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and $49.7 million in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges.\n2014 Compared With 2013\nSubsea Technologies' revenue increased $539.5 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue for 2014 included a $178.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenue increased by $718.0 million during 2014 compared to the prior year. We entered 2014 with a strong backlog. During the first half of 2014, high crude oil prices led to solid oil and gas exploration and production activity when compared to the prior year; however, a decline in oil prices that began in mid-2014 and which significantly further declined in the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected the subsea market. Despite the late 2014 decline in crude oil prices, we had solid order activity during 2014 from high demand for subsea systems and services. The year-over-year increase in revenue was attributable to the conversion of backlog and solid order activity in 2014.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit totaled $748.2 million, or 14.2% of revenue, in 2014, compared to the prior-year's operating profit as a percentage of revenue of 11.6%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by our Western Region subsea business from higher margin project backlog conversion and higher volumes in subsea services, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by additional contract value in 2013 related to an Angolan withholding tax adjustment.\nSubsea Technologies' operating profit in 2014 included a $24.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nSurface Technologies\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable/(Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,487.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,130.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,806.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(643.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(332.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit as a percent of revenue\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3) pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2 pts.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared With 2014\nSurface Technologies' revenue decreased $643.1 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.
