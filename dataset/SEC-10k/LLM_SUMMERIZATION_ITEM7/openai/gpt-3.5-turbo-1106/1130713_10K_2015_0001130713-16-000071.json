MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statement relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" or in Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are an online retailer offering a broad range of price-competitive brand name, non-brand name and closeout products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, apparel and designer accessories, health and beauty products, electronics and computers, and sporting goods, among other products. We also sell hundreds of thousands of best seller and current run books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and video games ( BMMG\u201d). We sell these products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the Website\u201d). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nOur company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, Overstock,\u201d Overstock.com,\u201d, O.co,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Business\nWe deal primarily in price-competitive, new, replenishable and closeout merchandise and use the Internet to aggregate both supply and demand to create an efficient marketplace for selling these products. We provide our customers an opportunity to conveniently shop for a broad range of price-competitive products. We continually add new, and sometimes limited, inventory to our Website in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. We provide suppliers with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. The merchandise offered on our Website is from a variety of sources including well-known, brand-name manufacturers. We have organized our shopping business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments-a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. We currently offer approximately 877,000 non-BMMG products and approximately 1.1 million BMMG products. Consumers and businesses are able to access and purchase our products 24 hours a day from the convenience of a computer, Internet-enabled mobile telephone or other Internet-enabled device. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nDirect business\nOur direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory and that are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we fulfilled approximately 8% of our order volume through our warehouse, which generally ships between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 16,000 orders per day during peak periods, using overlapping daily shifts.\nPartner business\nFor our partner business, we sell merchandise from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") primarily through our Website. We are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 3,700 third parties who supply approximately 870,000 non-BMMG products, as well as most of the BMMG products, on our Website. These third party partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping; however, we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future.\nGenerally, we require verification of receipt of payment, or authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal and BillMeLater), before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nOther offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Medici, doing business as t\u00d8.com, through which we have developed various fintech and crypto software products and intellectual property, including proprietary blockchain software;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Main Street Revolution, a store within our Website that features products from small businesses across the United States who offer their products using our national marketing and distribution channels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, while tapping into our distribution network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ecommerce marketplace channels, where some of our products are offered for sale in on-line marketplaces of other Internet retailers' websites;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using U.S.-based third party logistics providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pet Adoptions, a free service and tab within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Farmers Market, a tab within our Website where our customers can order locally grown fresh produce and other food products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Insurance, a tab within our Website where our customers can shop for insurance from major carriers for both personal and business insurance policies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an online car listing service which allows sellers to list vehicles for sale and allows buyers to review vehicle descriptions and post offers to purchase, and provides the means for prospective purchasers to contact sellers for further information and negotiations on the purchase of an advertised vehicle.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities (specifically, the allowances for returns and obsolete and damaged inventory);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>internal use software and website development (acquired and developed internally);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accounting for income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the valuation and impairment evaluation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loss contingencies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from direct revenue and partner revenue from merchandise sales. We also earn revenue from advertising on our shopping and other pages. We have organized our operations into two principal segments based on the primary source of revenue: direct revenue and partner revenue (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 20. Business Segments).\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the Estimate of Average Transit Times (Days)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nIncome Before Tax\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. In our statements of operations, we present revenue net of sales taxes.\nWe periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by our customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nDeferred revenue\nCustomer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to delivery of products or services ordered. We record amounts received for Club O Gold membership fees as deferred revenue and we recognize it ratably over the membership period. We record Club O Reward dollars earned from purchases as deferred revenue at the time they are earned and we recognize it as revenue upon redemption. If reward dollars are not redeemed, we recognize other income upon expiration. In addition, we sell gift cards and record related deferred revenue at the time of the sale. We sell gift cards without expiration dates and we recognize revenue from a gift card upon redemption of the gift card. If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize other income when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote based on our historical redemption experience. We consider the likelihood of redemption to be remote after 36 months.\nWe periodically enter into agreements with other parties to jointly market ancillary products or services on our website. As a result of those agreements, we sometimes receive payments in advance of performing our obligations under those agreements. Such payments received before we perform our obligations are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized over our service period.\nSales returns allowance\nWe inspect returned items when they arrive at our processing facility. We refund the full cost of the merchandise returned and all original shipping charges if the returned item is defective or we or our partners have made an error, such as shipping the wrong product.\nIf the return is not a result of a product defect or a fulfillment error and the customer initiates a return of an unopened item within 30 days of delivery, for most products we refund the full cost of the merchandise minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees. However, we reduce refunds for returns initiated more than 30 days after delivery or that are received at our returns processing facility more than 45 days after initial delivery.\nIf our customer returns an item that has been opened or shows signs of wear, we issue a partial refund minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees.\nRevenue is recorded net of estimated returns. We record an allowance for returns based on current period revenues and historical returns experience. We analyze actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance in any accounting period.\nThe allowance for returns was $17.9 million and $15.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nValuation of inventories\nInventories, consisting of merchandise purchased for resale, are accounted for using a standard costing system which approximates the first-in-first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method of accounting, and are valued at the lower of cost or market. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence and to the lower of cost or market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once established, the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory allowance represents the new cost basis of such products. Reversal of the allowance is recognized only when the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.\nInternal-use software and website development\nIncluded in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our Website and processes supporting our business. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two to three years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We use the with-and-without approach for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share-based deductions are recognized.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 arising from ordinary income and deductions and tax credits will be realized in the future, with the exception of current year operating losses generated by separate tax-filing subsidiaries in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. We have also concluded\nthat it is unlikely that our deferred tax asset arising from unrealized capital losses will be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated in domestic and foreign separate filing jurisdictions, unrealized capital losses, and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, our recent financial and operating results (three years of cumulative income and revenue growth during those periods), along with our forecasted growth rates, projected future taxable income, including the impact of any costs associated with our recent acquisition, and tax planning strategies. We perform multiple sensitivity analyses to address how potential changes in significant assumptions would impact our ability to generate the minimum amount of taxable income required. We give the most weight to objective evidence related to our more recent financial results. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, including the impact of any acquisition costs, and planned tax strategies over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deduction differences, net of existing valuation allowances. However, it is possible that certain state tax credits could ultimately expire unused if estimates of future apportioned taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2013 federal income tax return. The IRS has not indicated or communicated any deficiencies. We expect the audit to conclude in 2016. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nValuation of goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we make a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of goodwill, the\nfair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the other assets and liabilities within the reporting unit based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount allocated to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nIn accordance with this guidance, we test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter or when we deem that a triggering event has occurred. Goodwill totaled $15.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no impairments to goodwill recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\nWe capitalize and amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill acquired separately from third-parties are capitalized at cost while such assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable as described below under Impairment of long-lived assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired $15.8 million of intangible assets other than goodwill related to an asset acquisition. Aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, other\n</td> <td>1,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>17,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accumulated amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(2,475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' carrying amount to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. Cash flow forecasts are based on trends of historical performance and management's estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair values. There were no impairments to long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLoss contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings and other potential loss contingencies. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of probable loss can be estimated, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. We expense legal fees as incurred (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies).\nRecently issued accounting standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which\ndeferred the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. There have also been other Proposed Accounting Standards Updates which may further modify ASU 2014-09. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change on a retrospective basis for the periods presented. The adoption of this standard will cause us to reclassify certain debt issuance costs currently classified in other assets to a direct reduction of the related debt liability.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to the measurement of inventory after the date of adoption. We do not intend to adopt the standard before the effective date. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update), which states that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. We do not expect that ASU 2015-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which requires an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update. We do not expect that ASU 2015-16 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change on either a prospective or retrospective basis for the periods presented. We do not intend to adopt the standard before the effective date. We have not yet selected a transition method. The adoption of this standard will cause us to reclassify our current deferred tax assets to long-term deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new standard also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied under a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive\ncommentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRevenues in 2015 increased 11% compared to 2014. The growth in revenue was primarily due to an 8% increase in orders, coupled with a 4% increase in average order size, from $169 to $175. Although our average order size has increased in recent years, we expect the rate of increase to lessen as our sales mix shift into home and garden products becomes fully realized. In addition, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was less due to the timing of year end. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and by an increase in returns.\nDuring the second half of 2015, we experienced some slowing of our overall revenue growth which we believe was due in part to changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms, to which we are responding. While we worked to adapt to Google's changes, we increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search and display ad marketing, which generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search.\nIn 2015, we transitioned a significant number of customers into our Club O Silver program and began to shift coupon offers into Club O rewards. We believe that the shift from coupons to rewards will benefit us in the long-term, but we have experienced some difficulties with the transition, and in the short-term we believe it slowed our revenue growth as customers take time to become accustomed to this change. We are continuing to test and refine our approach in this transition.\nGross profit in 2015 increased 9% compared to 2014 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin decreased to 18.4% in 2015 compared to 18.6% in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, partially offset by a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.3% to 7.5% during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased spending in the display ad and brand marketing channels.\nAs a result of these factors, we had a 8.2% increase in Contribution in 2015 compared to 2014 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 11.2% in 2015 and 11.5% in 2014. In 2015, we changed our calculation of contribution and contribution margin to include Club O Rewards and gift card breakage as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. To improve the comparability between periods, the amounts disclosed for prior years reflect this change.\nTechnology expenses in 2015 increased $12.3 million compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in depreciation of $6.1 million and an increase in staff-related costs of $4.9 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2015 increased $10.4 million compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in staff and travel related costs, an increase in management consulting services of $2.9 million, a $1.0 million expense for a contract termination fee, and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $932,000 (including amortization of intangible assets related to our recent acquisition).\nIn January 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our long-standing prime broker litigation. The defendants agreed to pay us and our co-plaintiffs $20 million, which will conclude the litigation in its entirety. We will recognize the settlement in Q1 2016.\nIn Q3 2015, our majority-owned subsidiary Medici (dba t\u00d8.com) entered into agreements to acquire the assets and business of a financial technology company and three related registered broker-dealers for approximately $30.3 million as part of its initiatives to develop fintech and crypto software products and intellectual property including proprietary blockchain software. Medici closed on the acquisition of the financial technology company's assets in 2015 and on the acquisition of two of the broker-dealers in January 2016. Medici related expenses (including acquisition transaction costs) were $7.7 million in 2015. We are exploring possible synergies between Medici and our retail business, and also considering other alternatives for Medici including a spin-off or raising capital in Medici.\nAlthough we made efforts to reduce expenses in Q4 2015, we continue to seek opportunities for growth by expanding our sales and distribution footprint, through Medici's crypto-initiatives, and through other means. As a result of these and other initiatives, we may continue to incur additional COGS, sales and marketing, technology and/or G&A expenses. These expenses may be material, and, coupled with the seasonality of our business, may lead to reduced income as compared to prior periods or to losses in some periods.\nWe are continuing the construction of our new corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah and we expect to complete the project in 2016. We estimate that the total project will cost approximately $99 million, and as of December 31, 2015 we have incurred approximately $55.7 million in costs. In connection with this project, we entered into a $46 million term loan agreement and a master lease agreement for up to $20 million. We began borrowing under these agreements in 2015. The construction project and related financing is discussed in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources, Borrowings section below.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe

same period in 2014, was an 8% increase in orders, coupled with a 4% increase in average order size, from $169 to $175. Although our average order size has increased in recent years, we expect the rate of increase to lessen as our sales mix shift into home and garden products becomes fully realized. In addition, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was less due to the timing of quarter end. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and by an increase in returns.\nThe primary reason for decreased direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was a decrease in sales of home and garden products in addition to increased promotional activities including\ncoupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and by an increase in returns.\nThe increase in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to an increase in sales of home and garden products. In addition, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was less due to the timing of quarter end. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and by an increase in returns.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an appropriate\u201d mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing and joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, and the types of inventory we are able to obtain. These factors change frequently and affect the mix of the product lines we sell. While we have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years, our business model is to deal primarily in price-competitive, replenishable and closeout merchandise, which includes a wide variety of product offerings. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell is an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program. We recently enhanced the program by adding a two-tiered structure that includes our current standard Club O paid membership, which is now called Club O Gold, and an introductory membership, called Club O Silver, for customers who agree to receive promotional emails. In 2015, we transitioned a significant number of customers into the Club O Silver program and began to shift coupon offers into Club O rewards. This shift may adversely impact our revenues if the incremental sales from our Club O members as a result of this change are less than any decrease in the incremental sales from our current coupon program. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, Financial Statements-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td>

margin for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to increased warehousing costs due to additional warehouse space and increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 8 basis point increase in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, partially offset by increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $179,000 and $181,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): Table 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,657,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,497,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs and other cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,152,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fulfillment and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 20 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to increased spending in the display ad and brand marketing channels.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $217,000 and $336,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCosts associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons, are not included in marketing expense. Rather, they are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $50, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nWe constantly evaluate where we spend our sales and marketing dollars. From time to time, certain competitors may bid up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. At such times, we may reduce the amounts we spend in those marketing channels, which may lead to decreased visitors to our site for a time. In Q4 2015, the number of unique visitors to our site decreased by approximately 8% as compared to Q4 2014, in part we believe as a result of such changes.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in investments in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nWe have noted increases in the frequency and variety of cyber attacks on our Website. The impact of these attacks and the costs we incur to protect our Website against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs relating to them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $12.3 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation of $6.1 million and an increase in staff-related costs of $4.9 million.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $646,000 and $751,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $10.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses ( G&A\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in staff and travel related costs, an increase in management consulting services of $2.9 million, a $1.0 million expense for a contract termination fee, and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $932,000 (including amortization of intangible assets related to our recent acquisition).\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.5 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAlthough we made efforts to reduce expenses in Q4 2015, we continue to seek opportunities for growth by expanding our sales and distribution footprint, through Medici's crypto-initiatives, and through other means. As a result of these and other initiatives, we may continue to incur additional COGS, sales and marketing, technology and/or G&A expenses. These expenses may be material, and, coupled with the seasonality of our business, may lead to reduced income as compared to prior periods or to losses in some periods.\nDepreciation expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold - direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest income\nInterest income is primarily derived from the investment of our cash in cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $155,000 and $152,000, respectively.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to our cryptobond transactions. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $140,000 and $39,000, respectively.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.6 million as compared to $1.2 million in 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased Club O Rewards breakage of $3.9 million due to increased participation in the Club O Rewards program, including our recently introduced Club O Silver program, partially offset by costs of $850,000 related to our cryptobond transactions.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 60.8% and 33.4%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The increase in the 2015 effective tax rate relative to the 2014 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to current year operating losses generated by separate tax-filing subsidiaries in domestic and foreign jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been established. Our current year valuation allowance is primarily attributable to our majority-owned subsidiary Medici (dba t\u00d8.com). In Q3 2015, we acquired an additional interest in Medici for a total ownership of 81%. Tax losses incurred prior to our acquisition of the additional interest could not be used to offset our consolidated taxable income and were therefore fully valued. Medici's operating losses following the additional interest acquisition do not require a valuation allowance. We do not expect increases in the Medici operating loss valuation allowance in future years. The increase in the 2015 effective tax rate is also attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for unrealized capital losses. We have indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $366,000 at December 31, 2015. We would need to accrue and pay U.S. income tax on this amount if repatriated. We do not intend to repatriate these earnings.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>397,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRevenues in 2014 increased 15% compared to 2013. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 10% increase in orders, coupled with a 7% increase in average order size, from $158 to $169. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O Rewards (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using those channels. The increases were also partially offset by an increase in the revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered at year end due to higher average daily sales in the last week of the quarter.\nGross profit in 2014 increased 13% compared to 2013 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin decreased to 18.6% in 2014 compared to 19.0% in 2013. The decrease in gross margin was largely due to increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and Club O rewards due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using those channels.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.0% to 7.3% during 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to our increased spending in the sponsored search and display ads marketing channels due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales through those channels.\nAs a result of these factors, we had a 9% increase in Contribution in 2014 compared to 2013 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin decreased to 11.5% for 2014 from 12.1% for 2013.\nTechnology expense in 2014 increased $14.5 million compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in staff-related costs, depreciation, and technical consulting.\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2014 increased $3.6 million compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in staff and travel related costs and professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes in 2014 was $4.4 million compared to ($68.0) million in 2013. The large income tax benefit in 2013 was due to a $75.5 million deferred tax asset valuation release in 2013 after we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014,

from our direct to our partner business.\nThe increase in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to an increase in sales of home and garden products.\nGross profit and gross margin\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 178:

margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to increased net returns costs and increased promotional activities, which we recognize as a reduction of revenue (including coupons, site sales, and our Club O Rewards program) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using those channels. These increases were partially offset by a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nThe 52 basis point decrease in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to increased promotional activities including coupons, site sales, and our Club O Rewards program due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using those channels.

The decrease in legal costs is primarily due to defense costs and civil penalties totaling $13.9 million in 2013 related to the California district attorney case, compared to defense costs and judgment totaling $6.0 million in 2014 related to a patent infringement case.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nRestructuring\nWe reversed approximately $360,000 and $471,000 of lease termination costs during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as a result of our reoccupation of formerly restructured facility space.

The decreases in interest expense are primarily due to the elimination of the restructuring accrual.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million as compared to ($235,000) in 2013. The change is primarily due to increased Club O Rewards breakage of $947,000 due to increased participation in the Club O Rewards program, an increase of $306,000 in gift card breakage, and a decrease in unrealized losses on precious metals of $188,000.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 33.4% and (416.3%), respectively. Our effective tax rate was affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as a valuation allowance release and a non-recurring civil penalty in 2013. It was also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earned in those jurisdictions. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate relative to the 2013 effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2013, which significantly reduced the 2013 provision and effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrent sources of liquidity\nSubject to our use of the financing facilities available to us in connection with the construction of our new corporate headquarters as described below, we believe that the cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nAs we have previously announced, we are building a new corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. We currently estimate the total cost of the headquarters, including the cost of the land and related equipment and furniture, at approximately $99 million. We had incurred costs of approximately $55.7 million toward the project as of December 31, 2015. In 2014, we entered into a credit facility which provides for an approximately 27-month construction loan of $45.8 million (which is designed to subsequently convert into an approximately 6.75-year term loan following completion of the construction of the headquarters), and a three-year $10 million revolving loan. In October 2015, we received our first loan draw under the construction loan. At December 31, 2015 our outstanding liability on the construction loan was approximately $9.5 million. For additional information, see Borrowings - U.S. Bank term loan and revolving loan agreement below.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a Master Lease Agreement (\"MLA\") with U.S. Bank pursuant to which we may finance certain assets or sell certain assets to U.S. Bank and simultaneously lease them back. The agreement also allows us to finance software licenses (inclusive of the assets, referred to collectively as the \"Leased Assets\"). The MLA allows for leases and financing of up to $20 million. In November 2015 we entered into a Schedule to the MLA whereby we sold and leased back or financed Leased Assets for a period of 60 months for proceeds of $5.7 million. The weighted average effective interest rate of our leases under the Master Lease Agreement was 3.62% at December 31, 2015. For additional information, see Borrowings - U.S. Bank master lease agreement below.\nOur majority owned subsidiary Medici is working to demonstrate the viability of its fintech and crypto software that it has developed. In June 2015, we issued a $500,000 privately-placed digital \"cryptobond\" to our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne, in exchange for cash. During July 2015, we issued an additional privately-placed digital cryptobond to an unaffiliated purchaser for $5.0 million in cash and concurrently made a $5.0 million loan to the purchaser. At December 31, 2015 we have repaid the $5.5 million in digital cryptobond debt and offset that repayment with the proceeds of the $5.0 million loan to the unaffiliated purchaser. These transactions are described in further detail in the Borrowings - Cryptobonds section below.\nIn 2015, we reduced levels of certain inventory items in part to improve our liquidity. Inventories decreased by approximately $6.2 million during 2015.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, and our existing cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $170.3 million.\nCash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82,431\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow\nFree Cash Flow\u201d (a non-GAAP measure) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $(5.0) million and $39.5 million, respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of $54.5 million and $80.8 million, respectively.\nCash received from customers generally corresponds to our net revenues as our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us causing our receivables from these sales transactions to settle quickly. We have payment terms with our partners that generally extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers. As a result, following our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter sales, at December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable balances normally reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). However, our accounts payable balance normally declines during the first three months following year-end, which normally results in a decline in our cash and cash equivalents balances from the year-end balance. The seasonality of our business causes payables and accruals to grow significantly in the fourth quarter, and then decrease in the first quarter when they are typically paid.\nThe $54.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily from non-cash depreciation of $23.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $10.5 million and a decrease in inventories of $6.2 million. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to an increase in depreciation of web development projects. Accounts payable increased primarily due to increased fixed asset accruals related to the construction of our corporate headquarters. Inventories decreased primarily due in part to our efforts to reduce levels of certain inventory. Other factors contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were stock based compensation of $3.5 million and the increases in accounts receivable of $3.5 million and deferred revenue of $2.5 million.\nThe $80.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily from an increase in accounts payable of $21.7 million and accrued liabilities of $15.6 million, and non-cash depreciation expense of $18.1 million. Accounts payable increased due to increased holiday sales during the fourth quarter of 2014. Accrued liabilities increased due to increased marketing activities and legal matters. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to an increase in depreciation of web development projects. Other factors contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were the increases in deferred revenue of $11.1 million and consolidated net income of $8.8 million.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $82.4 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $59.5 million, acquisitions of business of $10.6 million, cost method investments of $7.0 million and disbursements for loans made of $5.0 million. The increase in expenditures for fixed assets includes $45.4 million for the development costs for our future headquarters.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $44.4 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $41.3 million. The increase in expenditures for fixed assets includes $16.7 million for the purchase of land and development costs for our future headquarters.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $16.5 million and outflows of $3.4 million, respectively.\nThe $16.5 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from $9.5 million of proceeds from our U.S. Bank term loan, $5.7 million of proceeds from lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $5.5 million of proceeds from issuances of privately-placed digital cryptobonds, offset by $2.4 million of purchase of shares of our common stock withheld for minimum tax withholdings upon the vesting of a portion of certain restricted stock award grants.\nThe $3.4 million used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the purchase of shares of our common stock withheld for minimum tax withholdings upon the vesting of a portion of certain restricted stock award grants and debt issuance costs related to the financing we obtained in preparation for the construction of our new corporate headquarters.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Amounts represent annual payments due OACCA for the naming rights. We have the right to terminate this agreement at our sole option, subject to payment of a termination fee. We expect to make the final payment of $1.4 million in May 2016.\nPurchase obligations\nThe amount of purchase obligations shown above is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of inventory purchase orders we had outstanding at December 31, 2015. Under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law, the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less.\nTechnology, marketing and other services\nFrom time to time we enter into long-term contractual agreements for technology, marketing or other services.\nHeadquarters construction costs\nWe have entered into various agreements under which we have incurred obligations relating to our plans to build an approximately 225,000 square foot building in Salt Lake City, Utah, to serve as our corporate headquarters, together with related facilities and improvements (collectively, the Project\u201d). We expect the total Project costs to be approximately $99 million. At December 31, 2015 we had incurred costs of approximately $55.7 million toward the project, including approximately $11 million we paid to purchase the land. Our obligations include payments to become due under the Construction Agreement described below, and under engineering, architectural, project management and consulting agreements, as well as anticipated expenditures for fixed assets and various other anticipated obligations related to the Project. These costs are based on our current estimates; however, the costs we actually incur, the amounts we actually pay and the timing of the actual payments could vary significantly from these estimates.\nU.S. Bank term loan payments\nWe have entered into a financing agreement related to the Project (see Borrowings below). The amounts presented reflect our estimated payments of principal and interest based on our anticipated draws on the loan. The timing and amount of our draws on the loan could vary significantly from these estimates. Further, $45.8 million of the amounts shown in the row titled \"U.S. Bank term loan payments\" reflect the scheduled repayment of headquarters construction costs and is therefore duplicative.\nU.S. Bank master lease agreement\nWe have entered into an agreement to finance or sell and lease back certain assets (see Borrowings below). The amounts presented reflect our payments and estimated payments of principal and interest based on our current and anticipated borrowings under the agreement as of December 31, 2015.\nAcquisition payment\nAt December 31, 2015, we were party to an acquisition agreement that closed in January 2016. The amount presented reflects the acquisition purchase price we paid in January 2016. See Item 15 of Part IV, Financial Statements-Note 3. Acquisitions, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.\nConstruction agreement\nWe estimate the total cost of building our corporate headquarters, including the land and related equipment and furniture, at approximately $99 million. Our wholly owned subsidiary O.com Land is party to a construction agreement (the Construction Agreement\u201d) with Okland Construction Company Inc. ( Okland\u201d) regarding preconstruction and construction services to be provided by Okland in connection with the construction of the Project.\nIn accordance with the Project Milestones as described in the Construction Agreement, Okland is required to Substantially Complete the Work (as such term is defined in the Construction Agreement) within 100 weeks following the commencement of the Construction Phase (as defined in the Construction Agreement) subject to modification under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Construction Agreement, O.Com Land agreed to make progress payments to Okland for construction services as set forth in the Construction Agreement, and subject to a 5% retention on progress payments for the Work.\nCryptobonds\nIn June 2015, as part of the fintech and crypto software that Medici has developed, we issued a $500,000 privately-placed digital \"cryptobond\" to our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne, in exchange for cash. During July 2015 we issued an additional privately-placed digital cryptobond to an unaffiliated purchaser for $5.0 million in cash and concurrently made a $5.0 million loan to the purchaser. At December 31, 2015, we have repaid the $5.5 million in digital cryptobond debt and offset that repayment with the proceeds of our $5.0 million loan. These transactions are described in further detail in the Borrowings - Cryptobonds section below.\nTax contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, tax contingencies were $821,000 and $709,000, respectively. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies to increase in the future. In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax contingencies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities. These assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.\nBorrowings\nU.S. Bank term loan and revolving loan agreement\nIn October 2014, we entered into a syndicated senior secured credit facility (the Facility\u201d) with U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\" or the \"Administrative Bank\") and certain other banks in connection with the construction of our new corporate headquarters (the \"Project\"). The Facility is governed by a Loan Agreement dated as of October 24, 2014 which provides for an aggregate credit amount of $55.8 million, consisting of (i) a senior secured real estate loan of $45.8 million (the Real Estate Loan\u201d) to be used to finance a portion of the Project and (ii) a three-year $10.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Loan\u201d) for working capital and capital expenditures, but not for the Project. We have satisfied the conditions necessary to borrow under the Facility, including making the required cash contributions toward the Project. In the future, we may be required to make additional cash contributions if necessary to maintain a loan to value ratio of 80% or less. The Real Estate Loan and the Revolving Loan are both secured by the Project, our inventory and accounts receivable, substantially all of our deposit accounts and related assets. We began borrowing under the facility in October 2015.\nOn or about January 1, 2017, upon completion of the Project, the Real Estate Loan is designed to convert into an approximately 6.75-year term loan due October 1, 2023 (the Term Loan\u201d). The conditions to conversion of the Real Estate Loan to the Term Loan include, among others, requirements that the Project must have been completed in accordance with the applicable plans, paid for in full, and generally free of liens; completion must have been certified by the project architect and the inspecting architect; certificates of occupancy must have been issued; we must have paid all amounts then due to the lending banks and must be in compliance with the covenants under the Loan Agreement; the Real Estate Loan must be brought in balance\u201d as defined in the Loan Agreement, which may require us to contribute additional cash to the Project; we must have paid the final amount of our cash contribution as required by the Loan Agreement; and if required by the Administrative Bank, an updated appraisal must show that the Project is in compliance with an 80% loan to value ratio requirement. If the conditions to conversion are not satisfied in early 2017, all amounts outstanding under the Facility will become immediately due and payable.\nAmounts outstanding under the Real Estate Loan and the Term Loan carry an interest rate based on one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% or an Alternate Base Rate plus 1.00%. However, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to fix our interest rate on the Real Estate Loan and the Term Loan at approximately 4.6% annually (see Derivative financial instruments in Note 2. Accounting Policies). Monthly payments of interest only will be due and payable on the Real Estate Loan prior to conversion. Following conversion, we are required to make monthly payments of principal estimated to be $1.1 million annually plus interest, with a balloon payment of all unpaid principal (estimated to be $38.0 million) and interest on October 1, 2023. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan will carry an interest rate based on LIBOR plus 2.00% or an Alternate Base Rate plus 1.00%.\nWe are required to maintain compliance as of the end of each calendar quarter beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2014 with the following financial covenants:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a fixed charge coverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis of no less than 1.15 to 1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a cash flow leverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis not greater than 3.00 to 1.00 during the Construction Phase (as defined in the Loan Agreement);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a cash flow leverage ratio not greater than 2.50 to 1.00 following the Construction Phase, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>minimum liquidity of at least $50.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015 we were in compliance with the financial covenants. In addition to the financial covenants described above, we are required to comply with a number of covenants relating to the Project and our business, including covenants limiting certain indebtedness. Notwithstanding, the Loan Agreement permits us to incur up to $20 million of additional senior-secured indebtedness for equipment financing (as described under U.S. Bank master lease agreement below), and other senior-secured indebtedness provided that the aggregate principal amount of such other senior-secured indebtedness does not exceed ten percent of our consolidated assets. The Loan Agreement includes customary events of default in addition to events of default relating specifically to the Project. The Real Estate Loan and the Revolving Loan are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. In the event of a default, the default rate of interest would be 2.00% above the otherwise applicable rate.\nUnless it terminates earlier or is extended with the consent of the Administrative Bank and all of the Banks, the Revolving Loan facility will terminate on October 24, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had borrowed $9.5 million under the Real Estate Loan. We have not borrowed any amounts under the Revolving Loan.\nU.S. Bank master lease agreement\nIn November 2015, we entered into a Master Lease Agreement and a Financial Covenants Rider (collectively, the Master Lease Agreement\u201d) with U.S. Bank Equipment Finance, a division of U.S. Bank National Association ( Lessor\u201d). Also in November 2015, we entered into a Schedule to the Master Lease Agreement (the Schedule\u201d). Under the Master Lease Agreement and Schedule we entered into a lease pursuant to which we sold certain assets (the \"Leased Assets\") to the Lessor, which we simultaneously leased back for a period of 60 months and financed certain software licenses (inclusive in the \"Leased Assets\") for a period of 60 months for proceeds totaling approximately $5.7 million. We have the right to repurchase the Leased Assets at the end of the term for $1.00. We have the right to repurchase the Leased Assets and terminate the Master Lease Agreement twelve months following the initial term. Payments on the Master Lease Agreement are due monthly. The weighted average effective interest rate of our leases under the Master Lease Agreement was 3.62% at December 31, 2015. We have accounted for the Master Lease Agreement as a financing transaction and amounts owed are included in Finance Obligations, current and non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. We recorded no gain or loss as a result of this transaction. The Master Lease Agreement allows for lease financing of up to $20 million.\nIn connection with the Master Lease Agreement, and as long as any obligations remain outstanding under the Master Lease Agreement, we are required to maintain compliance with the same financial covenants as the Term Loan agreement with U.S. Bank described above. At December 31, 2015 we were in compliance with these financial covenants.\nCryptobonds\nIn June 2015, as part of an initial demonstration of the fintech and crypto software that Medici has developed, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick M. Byrne purchased a $500,000 privately-placed cryptobond\u201d from us for $500,000 in cash. In November 2015, we redeemed the debt for principal plus accrued interest. Dr. Byrne waived his right to receive a redemption premium from us. The terms of the bond included a fixed annual interest rate of 7.0%.\nIn July 2015, as an additional step in demonstrating the viability of this technology, we issued an additional privately-placed cryptobond debt to an unaffiliated purchaser for $5.0 million in cash and concurrently made a $5.0 million loan to the purchaser. Both of these instruments were subsequently repaid. The debt we issued had a 7.0% annual interest rate and put and call rights that allowed us to redeem the debt at 105.0% of the principal amount, and allow the holder to require us to repurchase the debt at 102.5% of the principal amount. The $5.0 million loan we made to the purchaser had a 3.0% annual interest rate, resulting in an effective net interest rate payable of 4.0%. Both instruments had 5-year terms. The terms of our loan to the purchaser required concurrent settlement of both instruments, whether at maturity or pursuant to the exercise of the put or call features. In November 2015, we repaid the cryptobond debt and offset that repayment with our $5.0 million loan. The net interest and redemption premium due to the unaffiliated purchaser was approximately $312,000. At December 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding to either party.\nU.S. Bank letters of credit\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, letters of credit totaling $430,000 and $580,000, respectively, were issued on our behalf collateralized by compensating cash balances held at U.S. Bank, which are included in Restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank commercial purchasing card agreement\nWe have a commercial purchasing card (the Purchasing Card\u201d) agreement with U.S. Bank. We use the Purchasing Card for business purpose purchasing and must pay it in full each month. At December 31, 2015, $641,000 was outstanding and $4.4 million was available under the Purchasing Card. At December 31, 2014, $803,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card.\nOther Factors that May Affect Future Results\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to repurchase common stock, obtain credit facilities, or issue additional debt or equity securities. In addition, we may, from time to time, consider the investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, any of which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations regulate the disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial information.\nContribution and contribution margin\nContribution (a non-GAAP financial measure which we reconcile to \"Gross Profit\" in our statements of income and comprehensive income) consists of gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus Club O Rewards and gift card breakage and reflects an additional way of viewing our results. We had previously not included Club O Rewards and gift card breakage in our calculation of Contribution, but with significantly increased participation in the Club O Rewards program, including our recently introduced Club O Silver membership tier, the related amounts have increased and we believe they should now be included. Contribution margin is contribution as a percentage of total net revenue. We believe contribution and contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements information about our ability to cover our operating costs, such as technology and general and administrative expenses, while reflecting the selling costs we incurred to generate our revenues. Club O Rewards and gift card breakage are included in Other income in our consolidated income statement. Including these amounts in our contribution improves this measure by adding back the reductions in revenue that we recognized for Club O Rewards that have subsequently expired and for gift cards whose redemption is remote. Other income was $3.6 million and $1.2 million for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of Club O Rewards and gift card breakage, which were offset by other expenses of $2.3 million and $1.3 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Contribution and contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of Contribution is that it is an incomplete measure of profitability as it does not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income. You should review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nFor further details on Contribution and Contribution Margin, see the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures below (in thousands):\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,657,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,497,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,304,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,056,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Sales and marketing expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Club O Rewards and gift card breakage (included in Other income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) reflects an additional way of viewing our cash flows and liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and liquidity. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d is net cash provided by operating activities reduced by Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\u201d We believe that net cash provided by operating activities is an important measure, since it includes both the cash impact of the continuing operations of the business and changes in the balance sheet that impact cash. However, we believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations and free cash flow measures the amount of cash we have available for mandatory debt service and financing obligations, changes in our capital structure, and future investments after purchases of fixed assets. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows as calculated below (in thousands):\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "This report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of a company's financial condition and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statement relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" or in Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are an online retailer offering a broad range of price-competitive brand name, non-brand name and closeout products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, apparel and designer accessories, health and beauty products, electronics and computers, and sporting goods, among other products. We also sell hundreds of thousands of best seller and current run books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and video games ( BMMG\u201d). We sell these products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the Website\u201d). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nOur company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, Overstock,\u201d Overstock.com,\u201d, O.co,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Business\nWe deal primarily in price-competitive, new, replenishable and closeout merchandise and use the Internet to aggregate both supply and demand to create an efficient marketplace for selling these products. We provide our customers an opportunity to conveniently shop for a broad range of price-competitive products. We continually add new, and sometimes limited, inventory to our Website in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. We provide suppliers with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. The merchandise offered on our Website is from a variety of sources including well-known, brand-name manufacturers. We have organized our shopping business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments-a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. We currently offer approximately 877,000 non-BMMG products and approximately 1.1 million BMMG products. Consumers and businesses are able to access and purchase our products 24 hours a day from the convenience of a computer, Internet-enabled mobile telephone or other Internet-enabled device. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nDirect business\nOur direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory and that are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we fulfilled approximately 8% of our order volume through our warehouse, which generally ships between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 16,000 orders per day during peak periods, using overlapping daily shifts.\nPartner business\nFor our partner business, we sell merchandise from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") primarily through our Website. We are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 3,700 third parties who supply approximately 870,000 non-BMMG products, as well as most of the BMMG products, on our Website. These third party partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping; however, we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future.\nGenerally, we require verification of receipt of payment, or authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal and BillMeLater), before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nOther offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\n \u2022 Medici, doing business as t\u00d8.com, through which we have developed various fintech and crypto software products and intellectual property, including proprietary blockchain software; \n \u2022 Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies; \n \u2022 Main Street Revolution, a store within our Website that features products from small businesses across the United States who offer their products using our national marketing and distribution channels; \n \u2022 Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, while tapping into our distribution network; \n \u2022 ecommerce marketplace channels, where some of our products are offered for sale in on-line marketplaces of other Internet retailers' websites; \n \u2022 our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using U.S.-based third party logistics providers; \n \u2022 Pet Adoptions, a free service and tab within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States; \n \u2022 Farmers Market, a tab within our Website where our customers can order locally grown fresh produce and other food products; \n \u2022 Insurance, a tab within our Website where our customers can shop for insurance from major carriers for both personal and business insurance policies; and \n \u2022 an online car listing service which allows sellers to list vehicles for sale and allows buyers to review vehicle descriptions and post offers to purchase, and provides the means for prospective purchasers to contact sellers for further information and negotiations on the purchase of an advertised vehicle. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n \u2022 estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities (specifically, the allowances for returns and obsolete and damaged inventory); \n \u2022 internal use software and website development (acquired and developed internally); \n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; \n \u2022 the valuation and impairment evaluation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill; and \n \u2022 loss contingencies. \nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from direct revenue and partner revenue from merchandise sales. We also earn revenue from advertising on our shopping and other pages. We have organized our operations into two principal segments based on the primary source of revenue: direct revenue and partner revenue (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 20. Business Segments).\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nWhen we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. In our statements of operations, we present revenue net of sales taxes.\nWe periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by our customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nDeferred revenue\nCustomer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to delivery of products or services ordered. We record amounts received for Club O Gold membership fees as deferred revenue and we recognize it ratably over the membership period. We record Club O Reward dollars earned from purchases as deferred revenue at the time they are earned and we recognize it as revenue upon redemption. If reward dollars are not redeemed, we recognize other income upon expiration. In addition, we sell gift cards and record related deferred revenue at the time of the sale. We sell gift cards without expiration dates and we recognize revenue from a gift card upon redemption of the gift card. If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize other income when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote based on our historical redemption experience. We consider the likelihood of redemption to be remote after 36 months.\nWe periodically enter into agreements with other parties to jointly market ancillary products or services on our website. As a result of those agreements, we sometimes receive payments in advance of performing our obligations under those agreements. Such payments received before we perform our obligations are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized over our service period.\nSales returns allowance\nWe inspect returned items when they arrive at our processing facility. We refund the full cost of the merchandise returned and all original shipping charges if the returned item is defective or we or our partners have made an error, such as shipping the wrong product.\nIf the return is not a result of a product defect or a fulfillment error and the customer initiates a return of an unopened item within 30 days of delivery, for most products we refund the full cost of the merchandise minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees. However, we reduce refunds for returns initiated more than 30 days after delivery or that are received at our returns processing facility more than 45 days after initial delivery.\nIf our customer returns an item that has been opened or shows signs of wear, we issue a partial refund minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees.\nRevenue is recorded net of estimated returns. We record an allowance for returns based on current period revenues and historical returns experience. We analyze actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance in any accounting period.\nThe allowance for returns was $17.9 million and $15.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nValuation of inventories\nInventories, consisting of merchandise purchased for resale, are accounted for using a standard costing system which approximates the first-in-first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method of accounting, and are valued at the lower of cost or market. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence and to the lower of cost or market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once established, the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory allowance represents the new cost basis of such products. Reversal of the allowance is recognized only when the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.\nInternal-use software and website development\nIncluded in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our Website and processes supporting our business. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two to three years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We use the with-and-without approach for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share-based deductions are recognized.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 arising from ordinary income and deductions and tax credits will be realized in the future, with the exception of current year operating losses generated by separate tax-filing subsidiaries in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. We have also concluded\nthat it is unlikely that our deferred tax asset arising from unrealized capital losses will be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated in domestic and foreign separate filing jurisdictions, unrealized capital losses, and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, our recent financial and operating results (three years of cumulative income and revenue growth during those periods), along with our forecasted growth rates, projected future taxable income, including the impact of any costs associated with our recent acquisition, and tax planning strategies. We perform multiple sensitivity analyses to address how potential changes in significant assumptions would impact our ability to generate the minimum amount of taxable income required. We give the most weight to objective evidence related to our more recent financial results. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, including the impact of any acquisition costs, and planned tax strategies over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deduction differences, net of existing valuation allowances. However, it is possible that certain state tax credits could ultimately expire unused if estimates of future apportioned taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2013 federal income tax return. The IRS has not indicated or communicated any deficiencies. We expect the audit to conclude in 2016. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nValuation of goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we make a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of goodwill, the\nfair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the other assets and liabilities within the reporting unit based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount allocated to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nIn accordance with this guidance, we test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter or when we deem that a triggering event has occurred. Goodwill totaled $15.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no impairments to goodwill recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\nWe capitalize and amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill acquired separately from third-parties are capitalized at cost while such assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable as described below under Impairment of long-lived assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired $15.8 million of intangible assets other than goodwill related to an asset acquisition. Aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):\n\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' carrying amount to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. Cash flow forecasts are based on trends of historical performance and management's estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair values. There were no impairments to long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLoss contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings and other potential loss contingencies. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of probable loss can be estimated, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. We expense legal fees as incurred (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies).\nRecently issued accounting standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which\ndeferred the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. There have also been other Proposed Accounting Standards Updates which may further modify ASU 2014-09. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change on a retrospective basis for the periods presented. The adoption of this standard will cause us to reclassify certain debt issuance costs currently classified in other assets to a direct reduction of the related debt liability.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to the measurement of inventory after the date of adoption. We do not intend to adopt the standard before the effective date. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update), which states that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. We do not expect that ASU 2015-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which requires an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statement relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" or in Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntroduction\nWe are an online retailer offering a broad range of price-competitive brand name, non-brand name and closeout products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, apparel and designer accessories, health and beauty products, electronics and computers, and sporting goods, among other products. We also sell hundreds of thousands of best seller and current run books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and video games ( BMMG\u201d). We sell these products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the Website\u201d). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nOur company, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, Overstock,\u201d Overstock.com,\u201d, O.co,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Business\nWe deal primarily in price-competitive, new, replenishable and closeout merchandise and use the Internet to aggregate both supply and demand to create an efficient marketplace for selling these products. We provide our customers an opportunity to conveniently shop for a broad range of price-competitive products. We continually add new, and sometimes limited, inventory to our Website in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. We provide suppliers with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. The merchandise offered on our Website is from a variety of sources including well-known, brand-name manufacturers. We have organized our shopping business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments-a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. We currently offer approximately 877,000 non-BMMG products and approximately 1.1 million BMMG products. Consumers and businesses are able to access and purchase our products 24 hours a day from the convenience of a computer, Internet-enabled mobile telephone or other Internet-enabled device. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nDirect business\nOur direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory and that are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we fulfilled approximately 8% of our order volume through our warehouse, which generally ships between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 16,000 orders per day during peak periods, using overlapping daily shifts.\nPartner business\nFor our partner business, we sell merchandise from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") primarily through our Website. We are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 3,700 third parties who supply approximately 870,000 non-BMMG products, as well as most of the BMMG products, on our Website. These third party partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping; however, we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future.\nGenerally, we require verification of receipt of payment, or authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal and BillMeLater), before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nOther offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\n \u2022 Medici, doing business as t\u00d8.com, through which we have developed various fintech and crypto software products and intellectual property, including proprietary blockchain software; \n \u2022 Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies; \n \u2022 Main Street Revolution, a store within our Website that features products from small businesses across the United States who offer their products using our national marketing and distribution channels; \n \u2022 Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, while tapping into our distribution network; \n \u2022 ecommerce marketplace channels, where some of our products are offered for sale in on-line marketplaces of other Internet retailers' websites; \n \u2022 our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using U.S.-based third party logistics providers; \n \u2022 Pet Adoptions, a free service and tab within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States; \n \u2022 Farmers Market, a tab within our Website where our customers can order locally grown fresh produce and other food products; \n \u2022 Insurance, a tab within our Website where our customers can shop for insurance from major carriers for both personal and business insurance policies; and \n \u2022 an online car listing service which allows sellers to list vehicles for sale and allows buyers to review vehicle descriptions and post offers to purchase, and provides the means for prospective purchasers to contact sellers for further information and negotiations on the purchase of an advertised vehicle. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n \u2022 estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities (specifically, the allowances for returns and obsolete and damaged inventory); \n \u2022 internal use software and website development (acquired and developed internally); \n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; \n \u2022 the valuation and impairment evaluation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill; and \n \u2022 loss contingencies. \nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from direct revenue and partner revenue from merchandise sales. We also earn revenue from advertising on our shopping and other pages. We have organized our operations into two principal segments based on the primary source of revenue: direct revenue and partner revenue (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 20. Business Segments).\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the Estimate of Average Transit Times (Days)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nIncome Before Tax\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. In our statements of operations, we present revenue net of sales taxes.\nWe periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by our customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nDeferred revenue\nCustomer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to delivery of products or services ordered. We record amounts received for Club O Gold membership fees as deferred revenue and we recognize it ratably over the membership period. We record Club O Reward dollars earned from purchases as deferred revenue at the time they are earned and we recognize it as revenue upon redemption. If reward dollars are not redeemed, we recognize other income upon expiration. In addition, we sell gift cards and record related deferred revenue at the time of the sale. We sell gift cards without expiration dates and we recognize revenue from a gift card upon redemption of the gift card. If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize other income when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote based on our historical redemption experience. We consider the likelihood of redemption to be remote after 36 months.\nWe periodically enter into agreements with other parties to jointly market ancillary products or services on our website. As a result of those agreements, we sometimes receive payments in advance of performing our obligations under those agreements. Such payments received before we perform our obligations are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized over our service period.\nSales returns allowance\nWe inspect returned items when they arrive at our processing facility. We refund the full cost of the merchandise returned and all original shipping charges if the returned item is defective or we or our partners have made an error, such as shipping the wrong product.\nIf the return is not a result of a product defect or a fulfillment error and the customer initiates a return of an unopened item within 30 days of delivery, for most products we refund the full cost of the merchandise minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees. However, we reduce refunds for returns initiated more than 30 days after delivery or that are received at our returns processing facility more than 45 days after initial delivery.\nIf our customer returns an item that has been opened or shows signs of wear, we issue a partial refund minus the original shipping charge and actual return shipping fees.\nRevenue is recorded net of estimated returns. We record an allowance for returns based on current period revenues and historical returns experience. We analyze actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance in any accounting period.\nThe allowance for returns was $17.9 million and $15.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nValuation of inventories\nInventories, consisting of merchandise purchased for resale, are accounted for using a standard costing system which approximates the first-in-first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method of accounting, and are valued at the lower of cost or market. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence and to the lower of cost or market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once established, the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory allowance represents the new cost basis of such products. Reversal of the allowance is recognized only when the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.\nInternal-use software and website development\nIncluded in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our Website and processes supporting our business. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two to three years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We use the with-and-without approach for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share-based deductions are recognized.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 arising from ordinary income and deductions and tax credits will be realized in the future, with the exception of current year operating losses generated by separate tax-filing subsidiaries in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. We have also concluded\nthat it is unlikely that our deferred tax asset arising from unrealized capital losses will be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated in domestic and foreign separate filing jurisdictions, unrealized capital losses, and foreign deferred tax assets recorded as part of an acquisition. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, our recent financial and operating results (three years of cumulative income and revenue growth during those periods), along with our forecasted growth rates, projected future taxable income, including the impact of any costs associated with our recent acquisition, and tax planning strategies. We perform multiple sensitivity analyses to address how potential changes in significant assumptions would impact our ability to generate the minimum amount of taxable income required. We give the most weight to objective evidence related to our more recent financial results. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, including the impact of any acquisition costs, and planned tax strategies over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deduction differences, net of existing valuation allowances. However, it is possible that certain state tax credits could ultimately expire unused if estimates of future apportioned taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2013 federal income tax return. The IRS has not indicated or communicated any deficiencies. We expect the audit to conclude in 2016. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nValuation of goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we make a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of goodwill, the\nfair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the other assets and liabilities within the reporting unit based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount allocated to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nIn accordance with this guidance, we test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter or when we deem that a triggering event has occurred. Goodwill totaled $15.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no impairments to goodwill recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\nWe capitalize and amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill acquired separately from third-parties are capitalized at cost while such assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable as described below under Impairment of long-lived assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired $15.8 million of intangible assets other than goodwill related to an asset acquisition. Aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nIntangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, other\n</td> <td>1,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>17,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accumulated amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(2,475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' carrying amount to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. Cash flow forecasts are based on trends of historical performance and management's estimate of future performance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair values. There were no impairments to long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLoss contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings and other potential loss contingencies. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of probable loss can be estimated, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. We expense legal fees as incurred (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies).\nRecently issued accounting standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which\ndeferred the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. There have also been other Proposed Accounting Standards Updates which may further modify ASU 2014-09. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change on a retrospective basis for the periods presented. The adoption of this standard will cause us to reclassify certain debt issuance costs currently classified in other assets to a direct reduction of the related debt liability.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to the measurement of inventory after the date of adoption. We do not intend to adopt the standard before the effective date. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update), which states that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. We do not expect that ASU 2015-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which requires an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The new standard becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires entities to apply this change prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after"}
