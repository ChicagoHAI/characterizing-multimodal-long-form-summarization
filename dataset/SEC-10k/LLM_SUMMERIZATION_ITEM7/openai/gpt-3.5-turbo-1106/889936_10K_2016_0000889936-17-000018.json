MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis highlights the significant factors affecting our consolidated statements of income for the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014 and consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, The PrivateBank and Trust Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise stated, all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.\nPENDING TRANSACTION WITH CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE\nOn June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC\u201d), a Canadian chartered bank, and CIBC Holdco Inc. ( Holdco\u201d), a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC, which contemplates that the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger. Closing of the transaction remains subject to the receipt of required regulatory and stockholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the merger, the Bank will be headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, retain its Illinois state banking charter and be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC.\nOVERVIEW\nFor 2016, net income available to common stockholders was $208.4 million, increasing $23.0 million, or 12%, from 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $2.57 for 2016, an increase of 11% compared to $2.32 per diluted share for 2015. Results for the current year included $6.7 million of transaction-related expenses related to the pending merger with CIBC, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 on an after-tax basis. Our return on average assets of 1.13% for 2016 was consistent with the prior year, and our return on average common equity was 11.4%, compared to 11.6% for 2015.\nNet interest income increased by $68.0 million, or 13%, compared to 2015, reflecting higher interest income from $1.9 billion of growth in average interest-earning assets and the impact from a rise in short-term rates. Net interest margin was 3.30% for 2016, increasing four basis points from the prior year, primarily due to increased loan yields and the benefit from continued growth in noninterest-bearing funds in a higher rate environment, offset in part by increased costs for interest-bearing funds.\nNon-interest income for the current year was $147.8 million, a 14% increase from 2015, with growth in all major fee categories, excluding deposit service charges and fees and other income as 2015 included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of our Georgia branch. As a result of the growth in net interest income and non-interest income, net revenue increased $86.3 million from 2015. Non-interest expense increased 12% from prior year, primarily due to higher salary and employee benefit expense, professional services and technology costs.\nGrowth in earning assets continued to benefit operating profit, which increased 15% from $315.5 million for 2015 to $362.5 million for 2016. The efficiency ratio was 50.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and included the impact of the $6.7 million in transaction-related expenses, compared to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal loans grew $1.8 billion, or 13%, to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by growth in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Total commercial loans and CRE loans comprised 64% and 27%, respectively, of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 65% and 25%, respectively, at December 31, 2015.\nAsset quality remained strong, with nonperforming loans representing 0.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.41% at December 31, 2015. The provision for loan losses, excluding covered assets, increased to $34.0 million in 2016 from $14.7 million in 2015, reflecting the impact of $1.8 billion in loan growth and some credit migration during the year. The provision for loan loss will fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of loan growth and unevenness in credit quality due to the size of individual credits. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.23%, compared to 1.21% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding for the year was 0.06% for\n2016, relatively consistent with 2015. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.35% at December 31, 2015.\nTotal deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015 to $16.1 billion, primarily due to increases in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, up from 30% at the prior year end. Our deposit base is predominately comprised of commercial client balances, which will fluctuate from time to time based on our clients' business and liquidity needs. During 2016, deposit funding was supplemented with short-term borrowings, which increased by $1.2 billion from December 31, 2015. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 93.7% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.5% at the prior year end.\nPlease refer to the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for greater discussion of the various components of our 2016 performance, statement of financial condition, and liquidity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio's composition and performance, the identification of nonperforming loans and management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, based on historical loss experience as well as current economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from asset management, mortgage banking, capital markets products, syndications, treasury management, loan and credit-related fees, and other services charges and fees. Net securities gains/losses, if any, are also included in non-interest income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the primary source of the Company's revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is affected by (1) the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; (2) the volume and value of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity; (3) the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; (4) the sensitivity of the balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies; (5) loan repayment behavior, which affects timing of recognition of certain loan fees as well as penalties; and (6) asset quality.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and equity, also support interest-earning assets.\nThe accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFor purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable securities, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment is presented at the bottom of the following table.\nTable 1 summarizes the changes in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the average interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities, respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2016 and 2015, including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, Table 2 details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and indicates the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume versus yield/rate changes.\nTable 1\nNet Interest Income and Margin Analysis\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Tax-equivalent interest income increased by $83.3 million from 2015, largely driven by $1.4 billion in average loan growth, which contributed $58.5 million to interest income on a comparative basis. The impact of higher short-term interest rates on our largely variable rate loan portfolio primarily drove a $15.6 million increase to interest income compared to the prior year. Securities interest income on a tax-equivalent basis grew $8.8 million from 2015, primarily due to growth in the portfolio, while security yields continued to compress in the low rate environment. Interest expense increased by $14.8 million from 2015, largely related to higher deposit costs of $11.5 million, reflecting deposits indexed to a higher Fed Funds effective rate, higher rates paid on certain money market accounts, and growth in average interest-bearing deposits of $387.9 million. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $2.8 million from the prior year, reflecting higher average short-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreement balances during 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets growth of $1.9 billion from the prior year was primarily driven by higher average loan balances of $1.4 billion, with $642.0 million of the growth related to commercial and industrial loans and $711.4 million in CRE and construction loans. In addition, average securities balances increased by $532.5 million from 2015. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $857.5 million from the prior year, reflecting $387.9 million in higher average deposit balances, as well as $529.3 million in higher average short-term and secured borrowings, due to an increased use of short-term FHLB advances and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements during 2016.\nNet interest margin was 3.30% for 2016, compared to 3.26% for 2015. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by seven basis points from the prior year. Overall loan yields increased by 11 basis points from 2015, as improvements related to higher short-term rates were partially offset by continued pricing reductions resulting from the competitive environment and a lower contribution from our hedging program. Our overall loan yields continue to be aided by our hedging program, although at a reduced level as compared to 2015 due to higher short-term rates and a decline in the notional value of the active hedge program. Compared to 2015, loan fees were relatively unchanged at $31.1 million for 2016. Excluding the impact from loan fees, hedging, and movement in LIBOR, loan yields have continued to compress in the current environment. The yield on our securities portfolio declined 12 basis points from the prior year, reflecting accelerated prepayment speeds and reduced yields on securities purchased in the low rate environment.\nOur cost of funds for 2016 increased by eight basis points from 2015, driven primarily by higher rates paid on deposits. Deposit costs increased by ten basis points from the prior year, reflecting the repricing of deposits tied to a higher Fed funds effective rate, as well as higher rates paid on certain money market accounts. Deposits tied to the Fed funds effective rate totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016. Average noninterest-bearing deposits and average equity, our principal sources of net noninterest-bearing funds, increased in aggregate by $1.0 billion from 2015, adding five basis points of value to net interest margin due to higher volume and the increased value of noninterest-bearing liabilities in a higher rate environment.\nIn the prolonged low interest rate environment, competition remains strong, which has influenced loan pricing and structure. As a result, we have experienced a general decline in our loan yields due to pricing compression on new loans, including within certain of our specialty businesses, and, to a lesser extent, on loan renewals in the current environment. Future loan yields may be impacted by fluctuations in loan fees driven by acceleration of unamortized origination fees upon early payoff or refinancing, and prepayment and other fees received on certain event-driven actions in accordance with the loan agreement, as well as interest income recognized upon recovery of interest on nonaccrual loans. Approximately 70 percent of the loan portfolio at year end was tied to one-month LIBOR, which was 77 basis points at December 31, 2016, compared to 43 basis points a year ago and 53 basis points at September 30, 2016, with most of the fourth quarter increase occurring in December. An additional 16 percent of our loan portfolio is tied to prime, which increased in mid-December. The interest rate moves during December 2016 are expected to be more impactful to loan yields during the first quarter 2017, as a meaningful portion of our variable loan portfolio reprices toward the beginning of the month.\nTo the extent short-term interest rates continue to rise, the impact on deposit costs for our indexed deposits has greater predictability than our non-indexed deposits. Deposit costs will depend on various factors including client behavior, pricing pressure within the bank marketplace and from non-bank alternatives, the mix of our funding sources, and prices for alternative sources of deposits and funds. Depending on the pace and rate of future increases in deposit costs, net interest margin could be impacted.\nNet Interest Income - 2015 compared to 2014\nNet interest margin was 3.26% for 2015, compared to 3.22% for 2014, as the improvements in cost of funds from the $75.0 million partial redemption of our 10% Debentures in October 2014 more than offset lower loan and securities yields. Although contractual loan yields declined by four basis points from the prior year period, overall loan yields benefited from our hedging program, specialty lending activity, and higher loan fees. The eight basis point decrease in cost of funds for the year was driven primarily by interest savings from the partial redemption of 10% Debentures and, to a lesser extent, reduced borrowing costs from lower short-term FHLB yields in 2015 compared to 2014. Deposit costs increased one basis point from the prior year period. Average noninterest-bearing deposits and average equity, our principal sources of net noninterest-bearing funds, increased in aggregate by $804.6 million from 2014, but the low interest rate environment during the period reduced their value within the net interest margin, decreasing two basis points from 2014 to 2015.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income is derived from a number of sources including fees from our various commercial products and services such as the sale of derivative products through our capital markets group, treasury management services, lending and servicing and syndication activities, our asset management business, our mortgage banking business and deposit services to our retail clients.\nThe following table presents a break-out of these multiple sources of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 3\nNon-Interest Income Analysis\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015-2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset management income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Custodian fee income\n</td> <td>2,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total asset management fee income\n</td> <td>21,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking\n</td> <td>15,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital markets products\n</td> <td>25,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury management\n</td> <td>33,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan, letter of credit and commitment fees\n</td> <td>21,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndication fees\n</td> <td>20,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit service charges and fees and other income (1)\n</td> <td>8,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal fee revenue\n</td> <td>146,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net securities gains (2)\n</td> <td>1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 includes $4.1 million gain on sale of our Georgia branch completed in January 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 includes $466,000 of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest Income - 2016 compared to 2015\nNon-interest income for 2016 totaled $147.8 million, increasing $17.7 million, or 14%, from 2015. All fee revenue categories increased on a comparative basis, except deposits service charges and fees and other income as 2015 included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of our Georgia branch. Certain income sources, such as mortgage banking, capital markets products, and syndication fees, are transactional in nature and are significantly impacted by market forces (e.g., interest rates have a significant impact on mortgage banking volume and interest rate derivative products), and accordingly, tend to generate uneven income from period to period.\nAssets under management and administration ( AUMA\u201d) are impacted by the general performance in equity and fixed income markets. The pricing on asset management accounts varies depending on the type of services provided. Custody and escrow services involve safeguarding and administering client assets but do not involve investment management services. These assets are considered to be non-managed\u201d AUMA and have a significantly lower fee structure than managed\u201d AUMA. Managed AUMA are assets for which we provide investment management services, and fees from these assets are generally based on the market value of the assets on the last day of the prior quarter or month, which subject these fees to market volatility.\nAsset management fee income increased $3.2 million, or 18%, from 2015, primarily related to fees earned from the addition of a single $2.4 billion corporate trust account (shown below in custody assets) during the first quarter 2015, growth in personal managed assets of 9%, and to a lesser extent, price adjustments on certain managed asset accounts. Funds in the large corporate trust account were gradually disbursed or redeployed over the course of 2016, with the account expected to be fully disbursed or redeployed by the end of 2017. Accordingly, the related contribution to our asset management fee income declined throughout 2016 and will continue to decline in 2017. Aggregate AUMA was $9.7 billion at December 31, 2016, growing $2.4 billion, or 33%, from the prior year, largely attributed to the previously mentioned sizeable corporate trust account, a large corporate retirement account added during second quarter 2016, and growth in personal managed assets.\nThe following table presents the composition of AUMA, as of the dates shown.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AUMA\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015-2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal managed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,046,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,872,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,786,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and institutional managed\n</td> <td>2,643,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,787,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,347,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total managed assets\n</td> <td>4,689,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,659,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,133,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Custody assets (1)\n</td> <td>4,975,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,631,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,511,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUMA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,665,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,291,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,645,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016 included a corporate trust account of $791.6 million for which we serve as a trustee but do not provide investment management services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from our mortgage banking business, which includes gains on loans sold and certain mortgage related loan fees, grew $1.8 million, or 13%, from 2015, driven by a higher volume of loans sold and improved spreads compared to the prior year. We sold $485.4 million of mortgage loans in the secondary marked in 2016, generating a net gain of $12.2 million, compared to $470.9 million of mortgage loans sold in 2015, generating a net gain of $10.7 million.

Included in capital markets products income for 2016 was a $1.1 million positive CVA compared to a negative CVA of $373,000 for 2015. The CVA represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client-based derivatives and the related matched derivatives with interbank dealer counterparties. Exclusive of CVA, capital markets products income increased by $5.3 million, or 28%, compared to 2015, reflecting higher average deal sizes, longer maturities, and higher spreads for interest rate contracts, partially offset by somewhat lower revenue in foreign exchange ( FX\u201d) transactions as a result of spread compression. FX transactions generally provide a more stable source of fee income compared to the transactional nature of interest rate contracts, which are significantly influenced by clients' views on the extent and timing of future interest rate movements. As shown in the table above, over the past three years, fees from interest rate contracts have fluctuated period to period due to both volume and size of transactions. Increased opportunities in the client interest rate derivatives business are expected in 2017 as a result of the meaningful interest rate movements in the fourth quarter 2016 and changing expectations about the timing and extent of future interest rate movements.\nTreasury management income increased $3.3 million, or 11%, from 2015, reflecting higher volume across our treasury management platforms and ongoing success in cross-selling treasury management services to new commercial clients, partially offset by some price adjustments on certain services. We continue to build client relationships, with approximately 75% of our commercial clients using treasury management services at December 31, 2016. Cross-sell and implementation of treasury management services may lag the closing of a credit facility by three to six months on average. In a rising rate environment, growth in treasury management fees may be impacted as increases in the earnings credit rate allows clients to pay for more services with the same balances.\nLoan, letter of credit and commitment fees increased $695,000, or 3%, from 2015, driven by a $1.1 million, or 11%, increase in unused commitment fees, partially offset by lower standby letter of credit fees. The majority of our unused commitment fees related to revolving credit facilities, which at December 31, 2016 totaled $11.0 billion, of which $6.1 billion were unused. In comparison, at December 31, 2015, commitments related to revolving credit facilities totaled $9.7 billion, of which $5.2 billion were unused.\nSyndication fees of $21.0 million for 2016 grew $3.8 million from the prior year. The current year included two transactions which contributed $2.9 million of revenue in aggregate. During 2016, we were the lead or co-lead in 118 syndicated loan transactions, totaling $3.2 billion in commitments, while retaining $1.2 billion in commitments. In 2015, we were the lead or co-lead in 85 syndicated loan transactions, totaling $2.3 billion in commitments, while retaining $1.0 billion in commitments. Syndication fees per transaction typically vary depending on, among other factors, market conditions and the size and structure of the transaction, so the aggregate level of syndication fees earned by us in a given period is not entirely correlated with our volume of syndications and our syndication fees will fluctuate from period to period. While we generally expect increased syndication opportunities as we grow our loan portfolio and client relationships, our volume of syndication transactions depends on a number of factors, including portfolio management decisions, the mix of loans originated, and liquidity and demand by other institutions for syndicated loans. We believe that a number of macroeconomic conditions, such as declining commodity prices, and regulatory developments, such as enhanced regulatory focus on leveraged lending and CRE concentrations, have impacted market demand for syndicated loans, which could reduce our level of syndication fees in future periods.\nDeposit services charges and fees and other income declined $2.1 million from 2015. Prior year results included a $4.1 million gain on branch sale in the prior year. Current year results included $2.9 million in gains on sale of several problem loans.\nNon-interest Income - 2015 compared to 2014\nNon-interest income for 2015 was $130.0 million, increasing $12.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2014, reflecting growth in all categories except syndication fees. Other income for 2015 included a $4.1 million gain on branch sale.\nAsset management fee revenue increased $690,000, or 4%, from 2014, reflecting fees from new business added over the past year. We grew AUMA $645.1 million, or 10%, from year end 2014 to year end 2015, primarily attributable to continued client acquisition and cross-selling asset management services to our commercial client base. The largest growth (both from a dollar and percentage perspective) during this period came from corporate and institutional managed accounts, which generate proportionately higher fees than custody assets but lower fees than personal managed accounts.\nIncome from our mortgage banking business increased $3.8 million, or 37%, from 2014. The increase resulted from a higher volume of loans originated and sold reflecting lower long-term interest rates, favorable conditions in the housing market, and higher spreads for 2015 compared to 2014. During 2015, we sold $470.9 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market, generating gains of $11.6 million, compared to $359.6 million of mortgages loans sold in 2014, generating gains of $10.2 million.\nCapital markets products income increased $483,000 from 2014 and included a $373,000 negative CVA compared to a negative CVA of $46,000 for 2014. Exclusive of CVA, capital markets income increased $810,000, or 4%, from 2014, reflecting increased transactions and growth in FX transactions, partially offset by a change in the mix of interest rate contracts to lower yielding products.\nTreasury management income increased $3.2 million, or 12%, from 2014, primarily due to higher volume across our treasury management platforms. The increase from 2014 reflected the ongoing success in cross-selling treasury management services to new commercial clients as we continue to build client relationships.\nLoan and credit-related fees increased $1.3 million, or 7%, from 2014, largely due to an increase in unused commitment fees and standby letter of credit fees. The majority of our unused commitment fees related to revolving facilities, which at December 31, 2015 totaled $9.7 billion, of which $5.2 billion were unused. In comparison, at December 31, 2014, commitments related to revolving facilities totaled $8.8 billion, of which $4.8 billion were unused. The growth in commitments related to revolving facilities over the year reflected new client relationships added since December 31, 2014.\nSyndication fees were $17.2 million for 2015, decreasing $2.3 million from 2014. Syndication fees tend to fluctuate period to period depending on market conditions, loan origination trends, and portfolio management decisions.\nNon-interest Expense\nTable 4\nNon-Interest Expense

Included in non-interest expense for 2016 were $6.7 million of transaction-related expenses associated with the pending merger with CIBC that were largely reflected in professional services expense.\nCompensation expense, which is comprised of salaries and wages, share-based costs, incentive compensation, and payroll taxes, insurance, and retirement costs, increased $22.8 million, or 11%, from 2015. Salary and wages were up $10.5 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a larger FTE base compared to December 31, 2015 and annual compensation and promotion adjustments. Share-based costs increased $1.9 million, or 10%, largely attributable to a higher volume of awards granted during first quarter 2016 that met a shortened expense recognition period related to certain retirement provisions and a higher level of annual awards granted. Incentive compensation and commissions increased $9.8 million, or 19%, from 2015, reflecting improved performance resulting in higher incentive compensation and commissions on a higher FTE base. Consistent with prior years, due in part to the start of a new year for payroll tax purposes and the payroll taxes associated with incentive compensation payments (most of which are paid in the first quarter of each year), we expect first quarter 2017 compensation expense to be seasonally higher compared to fourth quarter 2016. First quarter 2017 compensation expense will be impacted by the timing of expense recognition for the equity awards we granted in February 2017. The terms of these awards differed from prior year annual equity grants as contemplated by the terms of the CIBC merger agreement, which will result in a greater portion of the share-based expense being recognized at the time of grant rather than over the vesting period. We estimate that first quarter 2017 share-based costs will increase by approximately $8.5 million to $15.0 million, compared to first quarter 2016, with a most of this increase attributable to the changed award terms.\nTechnology and related costs increased $5.0 million, or 26%, from 2015 and included higher costs to third party service providers and amortization costs related to several larger projects as we continue investing in our business.\nMarketing expense increased $1.4 million, or 9%, from the prior year, reflecting higher costs associated with sponsorships, contributions, and client development activities.\nProfessional services expense, which includes fees paid for legal services in connection with corporate activities, accounting, and consulting services, increased $7.6 million from 2015, primarily related to the transaction-related expenses mentioned above.\nInsurance costs increased $1.8 million, or 13%, from 2015, primarily related to larger FDIC deposit insurance premiums in 2016, reflecting overall asset growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the rate paid due to changes in the overall composition of our balance sheet.\nOther operating expenses increased $2.4 million, or 15%, from the prior year period. Other expenses include bank charges, costs associated with the CDARS\u00ae deposit product offering, intangible asset amortization, education-related costs, subscriptions, provision for unfunded commitments, and miscellaneous losses and expenses. The increase was attributable to higher subscriptions and dues, internal travel costs in connection with the pending CIBC merger and included a $5.4 million provision for unfunded commitments in 2016, compared to $519,000 release of reserve for unfunded commitments in 2015. These increases were partially offset by positive market value adjustments and gain on sale on various non-marketable investments, including partnership interests in various CRA investments and non-mortgage loans held-for-sale.\nOur efficiency ratio was 50.7% for 2016, improving from 51.4% for 2015, as top-line revenue growth out-paced increases in operating costs during the current year. We expect some contribution to revenue in 2017 from the early January 2017 repricing of a larger portion of our floating-rate loan portfolio in response to interest rate moves during December 2016, which would positively impact our efficiency ratio.\nNon-interest Expense - 2015 compared to 2014\nNon-interest expense increased by $21.2 million, or 7%, from 2014, reflecting higher compensation, marketing, and insurance expenses. This was partially offset by a decrease in net foreclosed property expense, a release in the provision for unfunded commitments, and lower operating expenses.\nCompensation expense increased by $22.8 million, or 13%, from 2014, due to increased incentive compensation accruals based on improved performance, additions to staff to support our growing business, and annual compensation adjustments. Salary and wages were up $7.4 million, or 7%, from the prior year primarily due to additional FTEs, as well as annual compensation adjustments. Share-based costs increased $3.3 million, or 21%, largely attributable to changes made to the retirement provisions of certain performance awards and a higher level of awards granted in 2015. Incentive compensation and commissions increased by $9.1\nmillion, or 21%, compared to 2014, due to improved performance resulting in higher mortgage banking commissions and incentive compensation plan expense. Payroll taxes and insurance costs were up $3.1 million, or 15%, from the prior year reflecting a higher compensation base and greater healthcare insurance costs in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nMarketing expense increased $2.7 million, or 20%, from 2014, as a result of our continued client development activities and increased advertising and branding investments.\nNet foreclosed property expense, which includes write-downs on foreclosed properties, gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties, taxes, and other expenses associated with the maintenance of foreclosed real estate ( OREO\u201d), declined $4.5 million, or 52%, from 2014. OREO writedowns totaled $2.4 million in 2015, declining $4.1 million from 2014. In addition, property ownership costs, such as property management and real estate taxes, were down $1.3 million from 2014 as the population of OREO declined from $17.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $7.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nInsurance expense increased $1.5 million, or 12%, from 2014, primarily due to higher FDIC deposit insurance in 2015 related to overall asset growth, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the rate paid as a result of changes in the overall composition of our balance sheet.\nLoan and collection expense, which consists of certain non-reimbursable costs associated with loan origination and servicing and loan remediation costs for problem and nonperforming loans, increased $1.8 million, or 26%, from 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased mortgage origination costs related to a higher volume of mortgage loans sold compared to the prior year, along with problem loan resolutions on two specific credits during 2015.\nOther operating expenses decreased $6.0 million, or 27%, from 2014, primarily reflecting a $522,000 release of reserves for unfunded commitments during 2015 related to specific credits previously reserved, compared to a $3.2 million provision recorded in 2014 largely related to $1.1 billion growth in commitments. Also included in other expenses during 2014 was $1.6 million of office relocation costs related to the Kansas City office space.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense. An analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods 2016 through 2014 are presented in the following table.\nTable 5\nIncome Tax Provision Analysis\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>324,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGenerally, our effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes, the effects of tax-exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank-owned life insurance, the effects of equity compensation, business expenses and tax credits.\nThe decline in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is attributable to larger levels of tax credits in 2016 and the $3.7 million impact of the early adoption of tax accounting changes for share-based payments in 2016.\nNet deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and totaled $128.8 million at December 31, 2016, consisting of gross deferred tax assets of $138.5 million offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $9.7 million.\nWe have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly, no valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2016. This conclusion was based on the Company's recent earnings history, on both a book and tax basis, and our outlook for earnings and taxable income in future periods. Proposed legislation that would reduce the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate would likely result in a reduction in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, the\nsignificance of which would be dependent on the degree of reduction in the tax rate. The charge to earnings would be recorded in the period of enactment. However, we would benefit from increased earnings in periods where the lower tax rate is applied to pre-tax profits.\nTaxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable temporary differences provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed. Additionally, we have relied on our expectation of generating pre-tax earnings in future periods, which should give rise to taxable income levels, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, that more likely than not will be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets.\nOperating Segments Results\nWe have three primary business segments: Banking, Asset Management, and Holding Company Activities.\nBanking\nThe Banking operating segment is comprised of commercial and personal banking services. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offered to individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services.\nOur Banking segment is the Company's most significant segment, representing 89% of our consolidated total assets and generating nearly all of our net income. The profitability of our Banking segment is dependent on net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income (exclusive of asset management fees), and non-interest expense. The net income for the Banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $228.9 million, a $26.0 million increase from net income of $202.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net income for the Banking segment was primarily due to a $68.5 million increase in net interest income resulting from 13% loan growth during the year. Non-interest expenses increased $32.0 million due primarily to an increase in salaries and incentive compensation primarily driven by new hires, salary increases, and higher incentive compensation tied to improved performance. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income for the Banking segment increased $27.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, and was primarily due to a $51.4 million increase in net interest income driven by 12% loan growth during 2014 and lower interest expense attributable to the $75.0 million partial redemption of our 10% Debentures in fourth quarter 2014.\nTotal loans for the Banking segment increased to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2016, from $13.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased to $16.1 billion at December 31, 2016 from $14.4 billion at December 31, 2015.\nAsset Management\nThe Asset Management segment includes certain activities of our Private Wealth group, including investment management, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow services, investment management services for 401(k) plans, and brokerage services. The private banking activities of our Private Wealth group are included with the Banking segment.\nNet income from Asset Management increased to $4.2 million for 2016, compared to $3.2 million for 2015 and $2.5 million for 2014. The current year increase was attributable to a higher level of fee income from growth in AUMA, compared to the prior years. AUMA grew to $9.7 billion at December 31, 2016, from $7.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and $6.6 billion at December 31, 2014, attributable to growth in both managed and custody assets from new client acquisition, including sizeable corporate trust and corporate retirement accounts added during 2016.\nHolding Company Activities\nThe Holding Company Activities segment consists of parent company-only activity and intersegment eliminations. The Holding Company's most significant asset is its investment in the Bank. Undistributed earnings relating to this investment are not included in the Holding Company financial results. Holding Company financial results are represented primarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses. Recurring operating expenses consist primarily of certain compensation expense and professional fees allocated to the Holding Company. The Holding Company Activities segment reported a net loss of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $20.8 million for the same period in 2015 and a net loss of $24.9 million for 2014. The increase in net loss in 2016 was due to higher non-interest expense in 2016 as a result of $6.7 million in transaction-related expenses. The Holding Company had $52.8 million in cash at December 31, 2016 compared to $61.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nAdditional information about our operating segments is also discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets were $20.1 billion at December 31, 2016, a 16% increase from total assets of $17.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Total loans increased to $15.1 billion at year end 2016 from $13.3 billion at year end 2015, representing a 13% increase. Our total deposits increased to $16.1 billion at year end 2016 from $14.3 billion at year end 2015, representing a 12% increase. Total stockholders' equity increased 13% from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015 to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Portfolio Management\nWe manage our investment securities portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity in an effort to protect net interest income levels against the impact of changes in interest rates. Investments in the portfolio are comprised of debt securities, primarily residential mortgage-backed securities and, to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities.\nWe may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors, including expected liquidity needs, the current and forecasted interest rate environment, our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate, the relative value of various segments of the securities markets, and the broader economic and regulatory environment.\nDebt securities that are classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported, on an after-tax basis, as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d). This balance sheet component will fluctuate as market interest rates and conditions change, with such changes affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. In periods of significant market volatility, we may experience significant changes in AOCI.\nDebt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity are securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold them until maturity and are accounted for using historical cost, as adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.\nTable 6\nInvestment Securities Portfolio Valuation

</tr>\n</table>\n* Less than 1%\nAs of December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio totaled $3.7 billion, increasing $611.7 million, or 20%, compared to December 31, 2015. During 2016, purchases of securities totaled $1.2 billion, with $549.0 million in the available-for-sale portfolio and $615.5 million in the held-to-maturity portfolio. The current year purchases in the investment portfolio primarily represented the reinvestment of proceeds from sales, maturities and paydowns in largely similar agency guaranteed residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities, as well as purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.\nIn conjunction with ongoing portfolio management and rebalancing activities, during 2016, we sold $45.4 million in state and municipal securities, resulting in a net securities gain of $1.1 million.\nInvestments in collateralized mortgage obligations and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities comprise 72% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2016. All of the mortgage securities are backed by U.S. Government agencies or issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. All residential mortgage securities are comprised of fixed-rate, fully-amortizing collateral with final maturities of 30 years or less.\nInvestments in debt instruments of states and local municipalities comprised 12% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2016. This type of security has historically experienced very low default rates and provided a predictable cash flow because it generally is not subject to significant prepayment. For a portion of our state and local municipality debt instruments, insurance companies and state programs provide credit enhancement to improve the credit rating and liquidity of the issuance. Management considers underlying municipality credit strength and any credit enhancement when evaluating a purchase or sale decision.\nWe do not hold direct exposure to the obligations of the State of Illinois. We hold some bonds from municipalities in Illinois, but the finances of these municipalities are not primarily dependent on the finances of the State of Illinois.\nAt December 31, 2016, our reported equity reflected unrealized net securities losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, of $3.5 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the unrealized net securities gains of $14.0 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in interest rates and the corresponding decrease in the market value of securities and unrealized net securities\ngains. We continue to add, as needed, to the held-to-maturity portfolio to mitigate the potential future market volatility of adding bonds to the available-for-sale portfolio in a low interest rate environment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified three municipal debt securities from the same issuer totaling $1.1 million, which had credit rating downgrades during the period. We determined that the difference between amortized cost and fair value was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized the $466,000 difference as a component of net securities gains in the consolidated statements of income. The securities were sold in January 2016 with no further losses recognized.\nThe following table summarizes activity in the Company's investment securities portfolio during 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, new loans to new clients totaled $1.9 billion, and growth in existing clients, net of paydowns, totaled $1.7 billion. Payoffs were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our five-quarter trailing average loan growth was $395.4 million at December 31, 2016, increasing $51.6 million compared to $343.8 million a year ago. Revolving line usage on the overall loan portfolio decreased to 44% at December 31, 2016, from 47% at December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting the addition of new unfunded commitments.\nOur loan growth was primarily driven by growth in the commercial and CRE loan portfolios, which increased $1.0 billion and $768.2 million, respectively, from December 31, 2015. Within the commercial loan portfolio, we saw growth in multiple industry segments from the prior year end, including finance and insurance, which increased $336.1 million, and healthcare, which increased $208.3 million. We also saw growth across multiple asset classes in the CRE portfolio during 2016. Multi-family is the largest asset class in the CRE portfolio, representing 24% of the total CRE portfolio at December 31, 2016, compared to 22% at December 31, 2015.\nHeightened competition from both bank and non-bank lenders has affected, and continues to affect, borrowers' expectations regarding both pricing and loan structure, which may impact our growth rate due to increasing availability in the market of financing alternatives offering terms outside our pricing and risk tolerances. Our primary strategy is focused on developing new relationships that generate opportunities to provide comprehensive banking services to our clients and, accordingly, we seek to maintain a disciplined approach when pricing and structuring new credit opportunities.\nWe generally earn higher yields on our commercial and industrial portfolio particularly related to our specialized lending products, such as healthcare and security alarm financing, than other segments of our loan portfolio. We also have greater potential to cross-sell other products and services, such as treasury management services, to our commercial and industrial lending clients.\nIn the normal course of our business, we participate in loan transactions that involve a number of banks in an effort to maintain and build client relationships while managing portfolio risk, with a view to cross-selling products and originating loans for the borrowers in the future. Although we often strive to lead or co-lead the arrangement, we also participate in transactions led by other banks when we have a relationship with, or seek to develop a relationship with, the borrower. Loan syndications assist us with decreasing credit exposure linked to individual client relationships or loan concentrations by industry, type or size. Of our $15.1 billion in total loans at December 31, 2016, we were party to $5.5 billion of loans with other financial institutions, consisting of $2.5 billion in retained balances in syndicated loans that were led or co-led by us and $3.0 billion for which we were a non-\nlead participant in the syndicated loan. Within this $5.5 billion portfolio, $3.3 billion of loans were shared national credits ( SNCs\u201d), of which we were the lead or co-lead in $1.1 billion and the non-lead participant in $2.2 billion. SNCs are defined as loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more regulatory depository institutions. Of the $1.9 billion of new loans to new clients during 2016, approximately $419.3 million, or 22%, related to SNCs. To the extent financing opportunities we pursue exceed our risk appetite for larger credit exposures and we are not able to syndicate the loan transactions, our loan growth may be impacted.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 based on our most significant industry segments, as classified pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification System standard industry description. These categories are based on the nature of the client's ongoing business activity as opposed to the collateral underlying an individual loan. To the extent that a client's underlying business activity changes, classification differences between periods will arise.\nTable 10\nCommercial Loan Portfolio Composition by Industry Segment\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,016,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>1,843,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,810,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and insurance\n</td> <td>1,669,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,333,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale trade\n</td> <td>860,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional, scientific, and technical services\n</td> <td>617,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate, rental and leasing\n</td> <td>583,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>542,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative and support and waste management and remediation services\n</td> <td>537,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Architecture, engineering and construction\n</td> <td>298,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunication and publishing\n</td> <td>250,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail trade\n</td> <td>231,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other (1)\n</td> <td>739,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,649,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,635,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>All other consists of numerous smaller balances across a variety of industries with no category greater than 2% of total loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes owner-occupied commercial real estate of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.9 billion at 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur healthcare portfolio within our commercial portfolio totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2015. We have a specialized niche in the skilled nursing, assisted living, and residential care segment of the healthcare industry. Loan relationships to these providers tend to be larger extensions of credit with borrowers primarily represented by for-profit businesses. At December 31, 2016, 21% of our commercial loan portfolio and 13% of our total loan portfolio was composed of loans extended primarily to operators in this segment to finance the working capital needs and cost of facilities providing such services. The facilities securing the loans are dependent, in part, on the receipt of payments and reimbursements under government contracts for services provided. Accordingly, our clients and their ability to service this debt may be adversely impacted by the financial health of state or federal payors. In recent years, there have been reductions in the reimbursement rates in certain states and government entities are taking longer to reimburse providers. For example, in the State of Illinois, the Medicaid reimbursement rate was reduced and the budget impasse, which has resulted in the state operating without a budget since June 30, 2015, has contributed to reduced Medicaid payments to healthcare providers. Although our healthcare commercial loan portfolio is well diversified across 28 states, loans to borrowers in the State of Illinois represented our highest geographic concentration of healthcare loans at 23% of the healthcare commercial loan portfolio, or $454.7 million, as of December 31, 2016. The challenged financial condition of the State of Illinois has had some adverse effects on the cash flow position of some of our Illinois-based healthcare borrowers. Despite this impact on client cash flows, to date, the healthcare loan portfolio has experienced minimal defaults and losses. We are actively monitoring the Illinois budget situation and its potential impact on our borrowers to manage the risks presented by the state's budget problems and overall challenged financial condition. In addition, across the broader healthcare industry, structural changes to government reimbursements may negatively impact performance for managed care facilities as borrowers adapt to the changes, particularly higher cost operators with thinner margins.\nOur manufacturing portfolio, representing 19% of our commercial lending portfolio and 21% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2016, is well diversified among sub-industry and product types. The manufacturing industry classification is a key component of our core business. During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, the U.S. manufacturing sector experienced a significant slowdown, as evidenced by declines or slowing rates of growth in a number of key indicators, due in part to the economic headwinds of lower commodity prices (including oil and gas prices) and a strong U.S. dollar, with particular stress faced by durable goods manufacturing. Although the U.S. manufacturing sector began to rebound toward the end of 2016, the sector's performance may continue to experience volatility due to the impact of commodity prices, currency exchange rates, possible U.S. corporate tax reform, U.S. political developments and broader geopolitical developments on this sector. Any stress or volatility experienced by the U.S. manufacturing sector specifically could adversely impact our existing loan portfolio and/or our future loan growth rate.\nThe third largest segment of our commercial loan portfolio is the finance and insurance portfolio, which increased $336.1 million, since December 31, 2015 and now represents 17% of our commercial lending portfolio at December 31, 2016 compared to 15% at December 31, 2015. Contributing to the increase year-over-year was growth in specialty finance loans, which totaled $496.1 million as of December 31, 2016, up from $388.2 million at December 31, 2015. This type of lending represents loans to nonbank specialty finance lenders that provide various types of financing to their customers, such as consumer financing, auto financing, equipment financing or other types of asset-based lending. The growth in this portfolio is a result of pursuing new opportunities to add specialized industry knowledge amongst our client relationship managers, with an expanded team in 2015 and a greater presence in the market. At December 31, 2016, amounts outstanding under bridge lines to private equity funds, which provide liquidity as a bridge to the next capital call from their investors, totaled $245.9 million, compared to $239.9 million at December 31, 2015. The draw repayment terms of such loans are generally between 90 and 120 days and, given their purpose, these draws generally remain outstanding for a short period of time. Amounts outstanding under these lines generally will fluctuate from quarter to quarter given their transactional nature.\nThe following table summarizes our CRE and construction loan portfolios by collateral type at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 11\nCommercial Real Estate and Construction Loan Portfolios by Collateral Type\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Real Estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>722,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>822,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>763,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office\n</td> <td>716,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care\n</td> <td>371,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial/warehouse\n</td> <td>493,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land\n</td> <td>232,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential 1-4 family\n</td> <td>56,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mixed use/other\n</td> <td>433,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,120,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,352,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care\n</td> <td>22,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>61,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office\n</td> <td>18,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condominiums\n</td> <td>36,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial/warehouse\n</td> <td>77,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential 1-4 family\n</td> <td>26,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mixed use/other\n</td> <td>53,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>522,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the combined CRE and construction portfolios, the three largest categories at December 31, 2016 were multi-family, retail and office, which represented 25%, 19% and 16% of the combined portfolios, respectively. Generally, we are a short-to-intermediate term real estate lender, and our CRE and construction portfolio strategies focus on core real estate classes in the markets in which we operate and established sponsors and developers with which we have prior experience, other banking relationships or the opportunity to offer comprehensive banking relationships. The multi-family asset type is diversified with a combination of stabilization of prior construction projects, existing property improvements, and stable assets with strong recurring cash flows. Payoffs during the year ended December 31, 2016 included property sales and refinancing into the long-term market.\nPortfolio Risk Management\nIn conjunction with our commercial middle market focus, our lending activities sometimes involve larger credit relationships. Due to the larger size of these loans, the unexpected occurrence of an event or development with respect to one or more of these loans that adversely impacts the value of collateral securing the loan, the success of a workout strategy, or our ability to return the loan to performing status could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe following table summarizes our credit relationships with commitments greater than $25 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\nTable 12\nClient Relationships with Commitments Greater Than $25 Million\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments greater than $25 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of client relationships\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage that are commercial and industrial businesses\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate amount of commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,153,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,976,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded loan balances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,620,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,841,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded loan balances as a percent of total loan portfolio\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the risk-based deposit insurance assessment framework, the FDIC has established a regulatory classification of higher-risk assets,\u201d which include higher-risk commercial and industrial loans (funded and unfunded), construction and development loans (funded and unfunded), non-traditional mortgages, and higher-risk consumer loans. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we have developed a plan to manage our level of higher-risk assets relative to our capital position and within our overall risk appetite and generally have focused in recent periods on being selective in originating loans that are classified as higher-risk assets.

Our higher-risk commercial and industrial loans are spread across multiple industries, generally command higher loan yields as a premium for underwriting the additional risk attributable to the leveraged position of the underlying borrower, and typically have lower collateral coverage than similar commercial and industrial loans that are not classified by the FDIC as higher-risk assets. Based on our historical experience, the loss factors and the probability of default for loans underwritten with such characteristics have generally been higher than our commercial and industrial loan portfolio as a whole and we take this into account in establishing our allowance for loan losses.\nMaturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016, by category, as well as the interest rate sensitivity of loans in these categories that have maturities in excess of one year.\nTable 14\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates (1)\n(Amounts in thousands)\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Due in\n1 year\nor less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after 1\nyear through\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,502,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,939,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,649,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>1,421,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,350,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,120,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>138,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>8,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>581,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>9,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal\n</td> <td>123,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,204,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,655,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,196,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,056,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans maturing after one year:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predetermined (fixed) interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floating interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,520,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>833,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,655,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,196,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Maturities are based on contractual maturity date.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis highlights the significant factors affecting our consolidated statements of income for the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014 and consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, The PrivateBank and Trust Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise stated, all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.\nPENDING TRANSACTION WITH CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE\nOn June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC\u201d), a Canadian chartered bank, and CIBC Holdco Inc. ( Holdco\u201d), a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC, which contemplates that the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger. Closing of the transaction remains subject to the receipt of required regulatory and stockholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the merger, the Bank will be headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, retain its Illinois state banking charter and be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC.\nOVERVIEW\nFor 2016, net income available to common stockholders was $208.4 million, increasing $23.0 million, or 12%, from 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $2.57 for 2016, an increase of 11% compared to $2.32 per diluted share for 2015. Results for the current year included $6.7 million of transaction-related expenses related to the pending merger with CIBC, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 on an after-tax basis. Our return on average assets of 1.13% for 2016 was consistent with the prior year, and our return on average common equity was 11.4%, compared to 11.6% for 2015.\nNet interest income increased by $68.0 million, or 13%, compared to 2015, reflecting higher interest income from $1.9 billion of growth in average interest-earning assets and the impact from a rise in short-term rates. Net interest margin was 3.30% for 2016, increasing four basis points from the prior year, primarily due to increased loan yields and the benefit from continued growth in noninterest-bearing funds in a higher rate environment, offset in part by increased costs for interest-bearing funds.\nNon-interest income for the current year was $147.8 million, a 14% increase from 2015, with growth in all major fee categories, excluding deposit service charges and fees and other income as 2015 included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of our Georgia branch. As a result of the growth in net interest income and non-interest income, net revenue increased $86.3 million from 2015. Non-interest expense increased 12% from prior year, primarily due to higher salary and employee benefit expense, professional services and technology costs.\nGrowth in earning assets continued to benefit operating profit, which increased 15% from $315.5 million for 2015 to $362.5 million for 2016. The efficiency ratio was 50.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and included the impact of the $6.7 million in transaction-related expenses, compared to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal loans grew $1.8 billion, or 13%, to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by growth in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Total commercial loans and CRE loans comprised 64% and 27%, respectively, of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 65% and 25%, respectively, at December 31, 2015.\nAsset quality remained strong, with nonperforming loans representing 0.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.41% at December 31, 2015. The provision for loan losses, excluding covered assets, increased to $34.0 million in 2016 from $14.7 million in 2015, reflecting the impact of $1.8 billion in loan growth and some credit migration during the year. The provision for loan loss will fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of loan growth and unevenness in credit quality due to the size of individual credits. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.23%, compared to 1.21% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding for the year was 0.06% for\n2016, relatively consistent with 2015. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.35% at December 31, 2015.\nTotal deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015 to $16.1 billion, primarily due to increases in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, up from 30% at the prior year end. Our deposit base is predominately comprised of commercial client balances, which will fluctuate from time to time based on our clients' business and liquidity needs. During 2016, deposit funding was supplemented with short-term borrowings, which increased by $1.2 billion from December 31, 2015. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 93.7% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.5% at the prior year end.\nPlease refer to the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for greater discussion of the various components of our 2016 performance, statement of financial condition, and liquidity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio's composition and performance, the identification of nonperforming loans and management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, based on historical loss experience as well as current economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from asset management, mortgage banking, capital markets products, syndications, treasury management, loan and credit-related fees, and other services charges and fees. Net securities gains/losses, if any, are also included in non-interest income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the primary source of the Company's revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is affected by (1) the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; (2) the volume and value of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity; (3) the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; (4) the sensitivity of the balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies; (5) loan repayment behavior, which affects timing of recognition of certain loan fees as well as penalties; and (6) asset quality.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and equity, also support interest-earning assets.\nThe accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFor purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable securities, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment is presented at the bottom of the following table.\nTable 1 summarizes the changes in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the average interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities, respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2016 and 2015, including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, Table 2 details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and indicates the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume versus yield/rate changes.\nTable 1\nNet Interest Income and Margin Analysis\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n(footnotes on following page)\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Trend\n\n (1) Interest income included $31.1 million, $31.0 million, and $26.4 million in net loan fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. \n (2) Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. This is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Refer to Table 25, Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures,\u201d for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment. \n (3) Includes loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans. Average loans on a nonaccrual basis for the recognition of interest income totaled $71.3 million for 2016, $57.9 million for 2015, and $82.7 million for 2014. Interest foregone on impaired loans was estimated to be approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $2.3 million for 2015 and $3.2 million for 2014, calculated based on the average loan portfolio yield for the respective period. \n (4) Covered interest-earning assets consist of loans acquired through a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and the related indemnification asset. Refer to the section below entitled Covered Assets\u201d for a detailed discussion. \n (5) 2014 includes deposits held-for sale. \nTable 2\nChanges in Net Interest Income Applicable to Volumes and Interest Rates (1)\n(Amounts in thousands)\n\n (1) For purposes of this table, changes which are not due solely to volume changes or rate changes are allocated to such categories in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. \n (2) Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. Refer to Table 25, Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures,\u201d for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment. \n (3) Covered interest-earning assets consist of loans acquired through a FDIC assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and the related indemnification asset. Refer to the section entitled Covered Assets\u201d for a detailed discussion. \nNet Interest Income - 2016 compared to 2015\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by $68.5 million, or 13%, to $587.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $518.7 million for the prior year. Tax-equivalent interest income increased by $83.3 million from 2015, largely driven by $1.4 billion in average loan growth, which contributed $58.5 million to interest income on a comparative basis. The impact of higher short-term interest rates on our largely variable rate loan portfolio primarily drove a $15.6 million increase to interest income compared to the prior year. Securities interest income on a tax-equivalent basis grew $8.8 million from 2015, primarily due to growth in the portfolio, while security yields continued to compress in the low rate environment. Interest expense increased by $14.8 million from 2015, largely related to higher deposit costs of $11.5 million, reflecting deposits indexed to a higher Fed Funds effective rate, higher rates paid on certain money market accounts, and growth in average interest-bearing deposits of $387.9 million. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $2.8 million from the prior year, reflecting higher average short-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreement balances during 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets growth of $1.9 billion from the prior year was primarily driven by higher average loan balances of $1.4 billion, with $642.0 million of the growth related to commercial and industrial loans and $711.4 million in CRE and construction loans. In addition, average securities balances increased by $532.5 million", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis highlights the significant factors affecting our consolidated statements of income for the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014 and consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. When we use the terms PrivateBancorp,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d we mean PrivateBancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term the Bank,\u201d we are referring to our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, The PrivateBank and Trust Company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes thereto, and other financial information presented in this Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise stated, all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis.\nPENDING TRANSACTION WITH CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE\nOn June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC\u201d), a Canadian chartered bank, and CIBC Holdco Inc. ( Holdco\u201d), a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC, which contemplates that the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger. Closing of the transaction remains subject to the receipt of required regulatory and stockholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the merger, the Bank will be headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, retain its Illinois state banking charter and be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC.\nOVERVIEW\nFor 2016, net income available to common stockholders was $208.4 million, increasing $23.0 million, or 12%, from 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $2.57 for 2016, an increase of 11% compared to $2.32 per diluted share for 2015. Results for the current year included $6.7 million of transaction-related expenses related to the pending merger with CIBC, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 on an after-tax basis. Our return on average assets of 1.13% for 2016 was consistent with the prior year, and our return on average common equity was 11.4%, compared to 11.6% for 2015.\nNet interest income increased by $68.0 million, or 13%, compared to 2015, reflecting higher interest income from $1.9 billion of growth in average interest-earning assets and the impact from a rise in short-term rates. Net interest margin was 3.30% for 2016, increasing four basis points from the prior year, primarily due to increased loan yields and the benefit from continued growth in noninterest-bearing funds in a higher rate environment, offset in part by increased costs for interest-bearing funds.\nNon-interest income for the current year was $147.8 million, a 14% increase from 2015, with growth in all major fee categories, excluding deposit service charges and fees and other income as 2015 included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of our Georgia branch. As a result of the growth in net interest income and non-interest income, net revenue increased $86.3 million from 2015. Non-interest expense increased 12% from prior year, primarily due to higher salary and employee benefit expense, professional services and technology costs.\nGrowth in earning assets continued to benefit operating profit, which increased 15% from $315.5 million for 2015 to $362.5 million for 2016. The efficiency ratio was 50.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and included the impact of the $6.7 million in transaction-related expenses, compared to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal loans grew $1.8 billion, or 13%, to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by growth in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans. Total commercial loans and CRE loans comprised 64% and 27%, respectively, of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 65% and 25%, respectively, at December 31, 2015.\nAsset quality remained strong, with nonperforming loans representing 0.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.41% at December 31, 2015. The provision for loan losses, excluding covered assets, increased to $34.0 million in 2016 from $14.7 million in 2015, reflecting the impact of $1.8 billion in loan growth and some credit migration during the year. The provision for loan loss will fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of loan growth and unevenness in credit quality due to the size of individual credits. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.23%, compared to 1.21% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding for the year was 0.06% for\n2016, relatively consistent with 2015. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.35% at December 31, 2015.\nTotal deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015 to $16.1 billion, primarily due to increases in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 32% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, up from 30% at the prior year end. Our deposit base is predominately comprised of commercial client balances, which will fluctuate from time to time based on our clients' business and liquidity needs. During 2016, deposit funding was supplemented with short-term borrowings, which increased by $1.2 billion from December 31, 2015. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 93.7% at December 31, 2016, compared to 92.5% at the prior year end.\nPlease refer to the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for greater discussion of the various components of our 2016 performance, statement of financial condition, and liquidity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset/liability management strategy. The provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio's composition and performance, the identification of nonperforming loans and management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio, based on historical loss experience as well as current economic and market factors. Non-interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from asset management, mortgage banking, capital markets products, syndications, treasury management, loan and credit-related fees, and other services charges and fees. Net securities gains/losses, if any, are also included in non-interest income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the primary source of the Company's revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is affected by (1) the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; (2) the volume and value of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity; (3) the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; (4) the sensitivity of the balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies; (5) loan repayment behavior, which affects timing of recognition of certain loan fees as well as penalties; and (6) asset quality.\nInterest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and equity, also support interest-earning assets.\nThe accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFor purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable securities, assuming a federal income tax rate of 35%. The effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment is presented at the bottom of the following table.\nTable 1 summarizes the changes in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the average interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities, respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for 2016 and 2015, including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, Table 2 details variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and indicates the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume versus yield/rate changes.\nTable 1\nNet Interest Income and Margin Analysis\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Refer to the section entitled Covered Assets\u201d for a detailed discussion. \nNet Interest Income - 2016 compared to 2015\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by $68.5 million, or 13%, to $587.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $518.7 million for the prior year. Tax-equivalent interest income increased by $83.3 million from 2015, largely driven by $1.4 billion in average loan growth, which contributed $58.5 million to interest income on a comparative basis. The impact of higher short-term interest rates on our largely variable rate loan portfolio primarily drove a $15.6 million increase to interest income compared to the prior year. Securities interest income on a tax-equivalent basis grew $8.8 million from 2015, primarily due to growth in the portfolio, while security yields continued to compress in the low rate environment. Interest expense increased by $14.8 million from 2015, largely related to higher deposit costs of $11.5 million, reflecting deposits indexed to a higher Fed Funds effective rate, higher rates paid on certain money market accounts, and growth in average interest-bearing deposits of $387.9 million. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $2.8 million from the prior year, reflecting higher average short-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreement balances during 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets growth of $1.9 billion from the prior year was primarily driven by higher average loan balances of $1.4 billion, with $642.0 million of the growth related to commercial and industrial loans and $711.4 million in CRE and construction loans. In addition, average securities balances increased by $532.5 million"}
