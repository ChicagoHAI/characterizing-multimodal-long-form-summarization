Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors described in this report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $146.7 million, or $4.75 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $163.2 million, or $5.20 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $183.2 million, or $5.70 per fully diluted share.\nThe following is a comparison of select data from our results of operations:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,164.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,012.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,905.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,410.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,371.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,338.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment and other gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,576.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,506.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,539.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 181.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended in 2015 and 2014 was primarily the result of increased premiums in all segments with the exception of International Specialty as our property reinsurance book was adversely impacted by increased competition and declining rates. All segments were impacted to some degree by increasing competition and, in some cases, declining rates, with our International Specialty and Syndicate 1200 segments being the most impacted by this competition. Net written premiums increased within our Excess and Surplus Lines and Commercial Specialty segments due to the increases in gross written premiums and increased risk retention. Net written premiums for our International Specialty segment declined in 2016 due to the reduction in gross written premiums, partially offset by increased risk retention. Net written premiums for the Syndicate 1200 segment declined in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 due to reductions in our participation percentages, partially offset by increased risk retention. The increase in consolidated earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 was due to the increase in gross and net written premiums.\nThe increase in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $20.9 million increase in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.9 million for the same period ended 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we evaluated our accounting for income from our alternative investment portfolio and determined that as we manage these investments to appreciate in value on a quarter to quarter basis, it is more appropriate to classify the change in value as net investment income as opposed to realized investment gains (losses). All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income increased $5.6 million from $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $91.2 million for the same period ended 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in income on our fixed maturity portfolio, partially offset by increased investment related expenses. The decline in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to a $16.5 million decrease in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.0 million for the same period ended 2015. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income was comparable at $85.6 million and $86.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total invested assets at December 31, 2016 were $4,192.4 million, net of $131.9 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2015 were $4,020.4 million, net of $95.3 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2014 were $4,022.7 million, net of $75.2 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers.\nConsolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $62.0 million in realized gains primarily from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $25.7 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $10.2 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $38.9 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $3.1 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an $11.9 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $34.3 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities and a $43.3 million gain from the sale of an investment property. Partially offsetting these realized gains was a\n$2.3 million realized loss from the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments within our equity and fixed maturity portfolio. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our investment portfolio was negligible for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses were $810.1 million, $766.1 million and $747.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the consolidated loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was attributable to increased catastrophe losses. The consolidated loss ratios were comparable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily due to improved current accident year losses in 2015, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses and reduced net favorable reserve development on prior accident years.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2016 were $63.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, including Hurricane Matthew and the Louisiana floods, the Alberta wildfires and the Taiwan and New Zealand earthquakes. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $33.3 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, which is presented in the table below.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2015 were $24.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from United States and other storm activity, and the Tianjin explosion. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $32.4 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line, our Syndicate 1200 liability lines and our commercial automobile lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in our workers compensation and commercial multi-peril lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2014 was $18.7 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, various hailstorms, Typhoon Rammasum and Hurricane Odile. Partially offsetting these 2014 accident year losses was $37.7 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line and our Syndicate 1200 liability and property lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in the commercial multi-peril and commercial automobile lines.\nThe following table summarizes the above referenced loss reserve development as respects prior year loss reserves by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Reserve\nDevelopment\n(Favorable)/\nUnfavorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\n2015 Net\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 948.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 322.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 163.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinsurance - nonproportional assumed property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fidelity/Surety\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 182.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,133.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining appropriate reserve levels for the year ended December 31, 2016, we maintained the same general processes and disciplines that were used to set reserves at prior reporting dates. No significant changes in methodologies were made to estimate the reserves since the last reporting date; however, at each reporting date we reassess the actuarial estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses and record our best estimate. Consistent with prior reserve valuations, as claims data becomes more mature for prior accident years, actuarial estimates were refined to weigh certain actuarial methods more heavily in order to respond to any emerging trends in the paid and reported loss data. While prior accident years' net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for some lines of business have developed favorably in recent years, this does not imply that more recent accident years' reserves also will develop favorably; pricing, reinsurance costs, legal environment, general economic conditions including changes in inflation and many other factors impact our ultimate loss estimates.\nConsolidated gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were $3,350.8 million (including $156.1 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), $3,123.6 million (including $102.3 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), and $3,042.4 million (including $80.3 million of reserves attributable to the trade capital providers) as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management has recorded its best estimate of loss reserves at each\ndate based on current known facts and circumstances. Due to the significant uncertainties inherent in the estimation of loss reserves, there can be no assurance that future loss development, favorable or unfavorable, will not occur.\nConsolidated underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses were $547.0 million, $536.7 million and $537.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in the expense ratio for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commissions received, reduced contingent commissions payable and lower equity stock compensation expenses, partially offset by increased premium taxes and assessment expenses. The decline in the consolidated expense ratio for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to lower acquisition cost primarily attributable to lower premium taxes, fees and assessments coupled with increased ceding commissions received. Non-acquisition cost increased due to higher compensation and information technology costs, partially offset by lower outside services expense.\nConsolidated interest expense was $19.6 million, $19.0 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of slightly higher interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments. The decline in consolidated interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was the result of slightly reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments.\nConsolidated foreign currency exchange gains were $4.5 million $18.3 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The changes in the foreign currency exchange gains were due to fluctuations of the U.S Dollar, on a weighted average basis, against the currencies in which we transact our business.\nThe consolidated provisions for income taxes were $35.2 million, $14.3 million and $32.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The consolidated income tax provision represents the income tax expense associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, the consolidated provision for income taxes represents taxes on net income for our United States, Ireland, Belgium, Brazil, Switzerland and United Kingdom operations. The consolidated effective tax rates were 19.4%, 8.1% and 15.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax income in the United States. Pretax income for our United States operations increased to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $64.8 million for the same period ended 2015. The decline in the consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced taxable pretax income in the United States while permanent tax differences remained consistent. Pretax income was higher in 2014, due to the recognition in 2014 of a $43.3 million realized gain from the sale of property. Additionally, our United Kingdom operations reported a tax benefit for 2015, primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.\nSegment Results\nWe are primarily engaged in writing property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. We have four ongoing reporting segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200. Additionally, we have a Run-off Lines segment for products that we no longer underwrite.\nWe consider many factors, including the nature of each segment's insurance and reinsurance products, production sources, distribution strategies and regulatory environment, in determining how to aggregate reporting segments.\nIn evaluating the operating performance of our segments, we focus on core underwriting and investing results before consideration of realized gains or losses from the sales of investments. Intersegment transactions are allocated to the segment that initiated the transaction. Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment, as decisions regarding the acquisition and disposal of securities reside with the corporate investment function and are not under the control of the individual business segments. Although this measure of profit (loss) does not replace net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability, management uses this measure of profit (loss) to focus our reporting segments on generating operating income.\nSince we generally manage and monitor the investment portfolio on an aggregate basis, the overall performance of the investment portfolio, and related net investment income, is discussed above on a combined basis under consolidated net investment income rather than within or by segment.\nExcess and Surplus Lines.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Excess and Surplus Lines segment:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 562.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 530.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 485.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 471.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,112.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,075.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross written and earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in the casualty and environmental units, partially offset by reduced premiums in the property, contract and allied medical units. Premiums for the property, contract and allied medical units continued to decline due to increased competition and low rates. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment continues to be impacted by increased competition and pressure on rates.\nThe increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with increased catastrophe losses.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11.6 million in catastrophe losses consisting of $5.5 million from various storm activity in the United States, $4.2 million from the Louisiana floods and $1.9 million from Hurricane Matthew. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $13.2 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $8.2 million of favorable development in our commercial automobile lines and $4.0 million of favorable development in our property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.5 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting these current accident year losses was $25.5 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $23.5 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines and $5.2 million in our commercial automobile lines. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $3.6 million of unfavorable development in the property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.3 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting the catastrophe losses was $38.9 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $54.7 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines of business. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $12.5 million of unfavorable development in commercial automobile lines and $3.3 million in the property lines.\nThe decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to reduced acquisition expenses due to increased ceding commissions coupled with reduced contingent commissions. Partially offsetting the reduced acquisition expenses were increased non-acquisition expenses due to increased information technology, depreciation and outside services expenses partially offset by an increase of claims related expenses transferred to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commission coupled with reduced outside services costs. Partially offsetting these reductions was increased compensation and information technology costs.\nCommercial Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Commercial Specialty segment:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 691.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 582.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 517.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 364.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 344.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 332.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 915.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 794.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 742.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in our public entity, professional liability and surety units. Partially offsetting these increases was reduced underwriting in our grocery and retail business units due to planned reductions as we exited unprofitable accounts and implemented underwriting initiatives. Additionally, gross written premiums increased $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased premium writings in our fronting programs. The fronting programs do not impact earned premiums, but result in ceding commissions received. The increase in earned premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in gross written premiums coupled with a reduction in ceding percentages for certain lines of business.\nThe decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with reduced catastrophe losses. The decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to improved current accident year results.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.6 million in catastrophe losses, including $2.1 million for storm activity in the United States and $0.5 million for Hurricane Matthew. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $22.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $9.0 million favorable development in the workers compensation lines, $7.0 million in the surety lines, $6.2 million in automobile liability lines and $2.0 million in the property lines. Partially offsetting this favorable development was $1.5 million of unfavorable development in the other liability lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.2 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $2.5 million in net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $11.9 million of unfavorable development in general liability and $8.7 million of unfavorable development in the workers compensation lines due to increases in claim severity. Partially offsetting this unfavorable development was $8.8 million of favorable development in short-tail lines, $6.6 million favorable development in errors and ommissions lines and $2.1 million of favorable development on an assumed directors and officers program.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $1.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $19.5 million of unfavorable development in general liability due to increases in claim severity, offset by favorable development of $8.5 million in errors and ommissions lines, $7.9 million in short-tail lines and $5.8 million in workers compensation.\nThe increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million favorable adjustment to the premium taxes and assessments accrual recorded in 2015. Partially offsetting the increased premium taxes and assessments was increased fronting fees received and an increase of claims related\nexpenses reclassified to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to the favorable change in estimate of the premium taxes and assessments accrual.\nFee and other income increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 due to the recognition of a $1.7 million gain on the sale of certain business units. The decline in fee and other expenses was primarily attributable to certain programs that were previously non-risk bearing converting to risk bearing programs.\nAs a result of our annual evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets, we determined that the goodwill and intangible asset which resulted from a 2010 acquisition were impaired and therefore, we wrote-off $3.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInternational Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the International Specialty segment:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 266.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 279.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 374.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 313.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in our property reinsurance unit due to increased competition, changes in terms and conditions and declining rates. Partially offsetting this decline was increased gross written premiums in our casualty and professional liability units which was the result of new business submissions partially offset by declining rates and increased competition. Gross written premiums for our Brazilian unit was favorably impacted by currency gains, as the Brazilian Real strengthened against the U.S Dollar. The increase in earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a reduction in our ceding percentages, coupled with a change in business mix.\nThe increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses partially offset by increased net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years. The decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years partially offset by a slight increase in catastrophe losses.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $19.6 million in catastrophe losses including $11.2 million from the Alberta wildfires, $3.5 million from the Taiwan and New Zealand earthquakes, $2.8 million from various storm activity and $2.1 million from Hurricane Matthew. Partially offsetting these catastrophe losses was $11.0 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $8.8 million of favorable development on the property reinsurance lines and $2.1 million of favorable development for our Brazil unit.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $9.2 million in catastrophe losses resulting from the Tianjin explosion and various storms. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $7.7 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $5.7 million of favorable development on the casualty and professional lines and $2.4 million of favorable development on the property reinsurance lines.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $8.2 million in catastrophe losses primarily attributable to hail and other storms. Loss reserve development on prior accident years was negligible.\nThe decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased commission expense, an increase of claims related expenses transferred to unallocated loss adjustment expenses, lower contingent commissions payable and lower assessments payable. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to increased ceding commission received on our professional lines and casualty business, coupled with reduced fixed costs for our Brazil unit.\nSyndicate 1200\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Syndicate 1200 segment:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 625.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 600.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 577.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 406.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 409.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 414.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 164.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 615.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 607.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, we reduced our participation percentage on the Syndicate to 62%, down from 68% for 2015 and 75% for 2014. The balance of the capital supporting the Syndicate is made up primarily by trade and other capital providers. The increase in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in the property, marine and energy and specialty lines divisions due to a change in business mix within these lines, focusing on lines which result in profitable growth. Partially offsetting the increased gross written premiums within these divisions were declines in the liability lines and aerospace divisions due to reduced profitability over the past years. The increase in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in all divisions, excluding marine and energy, as we continued to establish new products, entered the Asian market and expanded profitable lines. The Syndicate 1200 segment has been adversely impacted by increased competition beginning in 2014 and continuing into 2015 and 2016. The decline in earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the reduction in our participation percentage, partially offset by a reduction in our ceding percentages\nThe increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses combined with reduced net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years. The increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years partially offset by current accident year results.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses are reported net of losses ceded to the trade capital providers. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $30.1 million of catastrophe losses including $12.0 million for Hurricane Matthew, $9.0 million for other storm activity in the United States and $8.1 million for the Louisiana floods. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $5.0 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $4.8 favorable development in the marine and energy lines, $3.3 million favorable development in the general liability lines and $1.6 million favorable development in the property lines. Partially offsetting this favorable development was $5.0 million of unfavorable development in the specialty lines, primarily in the accident and health and political risk lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.0 million of catastrophe losses resulting from the Tianjin explosion and various storms. Offsetting the catastrophe losses was $10.3 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $5.5 million favorable development in various property classes, $6.2 million favorable development in the liability lines and $2.4 million favorable development in the energy lines, partially offset by $2.5 million of unfavorable development in the Specialty lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.4 million of catastrophe losses resulting from Hurricane Odile. Offsetting the catastrophe losses was $21.1 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $14.7 favorable development in various property classes, $3.3 million favorable development in the liability lines and $3.9 million favorable development in the marine and energy, aerospace and specialty lines.\nThe decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to reduced compensation related expenses partially offset by increased acquisition costs resulting from higher broker expenses due to the current competitive market. The increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased acquisition costs resulting from higher broker expenses due to the current competitive market.\nFee and other income represents fees and profit commission derived from the management of third party capital for our underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's. Fee and other income is comparable for the three years.

Argonaut Insurance Company has direct liability arising primarily from policies issued from the 1960s to the early 1980s, which pre-dated policy contract wording that excluded asbestos exposure. The majority of the direct policies were issued on behalf of small contractors or construction companies. We believe that the frequency and severity of asbestos claims for such insureds is typically less than that experienced for large, industrial manufacturing and distribution concerns.\nArgonaut Insurance Company also assumed risk as a reinsurer, primarily for the period from 1970 to 1975, a portion of which was assumed from the London market. Argonaut Insurance Company also reinsured risks on policies written by domestic carriers. Such reinsurance typically provided coverage for limits attaching at a relatively high level, which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted. Some of the claims now being filed on policies reinsured by Argonaut Insurance Company are on behalf of claimants who may have been exposed at some time to asbestos incorporated into buildings they occupied, but have no apparent medical problems resulting from such exposure. Additionally, lawsuits are being brought against businesses that were not directly involved in the manufacture or installation of materials containing asbestos. We believe that a significant portion of claims generated out of this population of claimants may result in incurred losses generally lower than the asbestos claims filed over the past decade and could be below the attachment level of Argonaut Insurance Company.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $18.6 million of net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $9.1 million from our asbestos exposure, $6.5 million from our run-off risk management lines and $3.0 million from our other run-off lines. The unfavorable development from our asbestos exposure was due to increased defense costs and a final settlement with a large primary insured.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $8.6 million of net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily driven by $5.9 million of unfavorable development in our run-off workers compensation lines due to increasing medical costs on older claims and the unwind of reserve discount, $4.2 million of unfavorable development in our asbestos and environmental exposures driven by increased defense costs in our primary asbestos exposure and\n$1.2 million of unfavorable development in our other assumed business. Partially offsetting this unfavorable development was $2.7 million of net favorable development in our run-off property catastrophe reinsurance lines.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $24.4 million of net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily driven by $13.5 million from our asbestos and environmental exposure and $10.3 million in our run-off workers compensation lines. The unfavorable development from our asbestos and environmental exposures was driven by our primary exposures and our domestic assumed programs. The unfavorable development for our workers compensation lines was the result of increasing medical costs on older claims.\nUnderwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses for the Run-off Lines segment consists primarily of administrative expenses. Underwriting expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was favorably impacted by reduced policyholder dividends and outside services fees. Underwriting expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by a $2.3 million reduction in the premiums and insolvency assessment accruals. Underwriting expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorably impacted by a $1.1 million recovery of a policyholder dividend in the run-off risk management lines, offset by $1.8 million in higher fee and bad debt expenses.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of total gross and net reserves for the Run-off Lines.

We continually monitor the status of the claims and may make adjustments outside the annual review period. The review entails a detailed analysis of our direct and assumed exposure. We consider the indications from the various actuarial methods from the review to determine our best estimate of the asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expense reserves. We primarily relied on a method that projects future reported claims and severities, with some weight given to other methods. This method relies most heavily on our historical claims and severity information, whereas other methods rely more heavily on industry information. The method produces an estimate of IBNR losses based on projections of future claims and the average severity for those future claims. The severities were calculated based on our specific data and in our opinion best reflect our liabilities based upon the insurance policies issued.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the number of asbestos and environmental claims outstanding:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open claims, beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Claims closed during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Claims opened during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open claims, end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table represents gross payments on asbestos and environmental claims:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross payments on closed claims\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross payments on open claims\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of the types of coverage within the Run-off Lines of business still being serviced by Argonaut Insurance Company, a significant amount of subjectivity and uncertainty exists in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Factors that increase these uncertainties are: (1) lack of historical data, (2) inapplicability of standard actuarial projection techniques, (3)\nuncertainties regarding ultimate claim costs, (4) coverage interpretations and (5) the judicial, statutory and regulatory environments under which these claims may ultimately be resolved. Significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability due to the potentially long waiting period between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims. Due to these uncertainties, the current trends may not be indicative of future results. Although we have determined and recorded our best estimate of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for Run-off Lines, current judicial and legislative decisions continue to broaden liability, expand policy scopes and increase the severity of claims payments. As a result of these and other recent developments, the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate loss reserves are heightened, further complicating the already complex process of determining loss reserves. The industry as a whole is involved in extensive litigation over these coverages and liability issues continue to make it difficult to quantify these exposures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of our cash flows are premiums, reinsurance recoveries, proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and investment income. The primary cash outflows are claim payments, loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance costs and operating expenses. Additional cash outflows occur through payments of underwriting and acquisition costs such as commissions, taxes, payroll and general overhead expenses. Management believes that cash receipts from premiums, proceeds from investment sales and redemptions and investment income are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future. Should the need for additional cash arise, we believe we have access to additional sources of liquidity.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities can fluctuate due to timing difference in the collection of premiums and reinsurance recoveries and the payment of losses and expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $181.4 million, $282.6 million and $130.5 million, respectively. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by the timing of reinsurance recoveries and premium cash receipts in the respective periods. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by the timing of reinsurance payments primarily concentrated in the Syndicate 1200 segment, partially offset by the first quarter 2014 partial settlement of a whole account quota share contract covering the Syndicate 1200 segment loss reserves for the 2009 and prior years of account.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $145.1 million, $193.6 million and $121.3 million, respectively. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from 2015 to 2016 was mainly the result of maturities and sales of fixed maturity investments and equity securities, partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase fixed maturities and short-term investments. Included in purchases of fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42.0 million associated with the acquisition of real estate holdings, which were purchased on our behalf by a third-party intermediary using funds held in escrow from the fourth quarter 2014 sale of the Torrance, California real estate holdings, as previously disclosed in our December 31, 2014 Form 10-K. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities from 2014 to 2015 was mainly the result of purchases of fixed maturities, partially offset by the inflow of cash from maturities and sales of fixed maturity investments. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $405.5 million, $210.8 million, and $258.3 million, respectively, of the investment portfolio were invested in short-term investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $72.1 million, $50.0 million, and $82.4 million, respectively. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million, 0.6 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively, of our common shares for a total cost of $47.1 million, $29.7 million and $50.8 million, respectively. We paid dividends to our shareholders totaling $26.6 million, $22.7 million and $18.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2014, we paid $18.0 million for the extinguishment of one of our fixed rate trust preferred securities.\nArgo Group and its other holding company subsidiaries are largely dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from their insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to their shareholders, for debt service and for their operating expenses. The ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the jurisdictions of domicile that regulate our immediate insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and each jurisdiction has calculations for the amount of dividends that an insurance and reinsurance company can pay without the approval of the insurance regulator.\nIn addition, our ability to receive dividends from our downstream subsidiaries is subject to the ability of each parent corporation within the corporate ownership structure to receive dividends from its respective subsidiary(ies), based upon the subsidiary's domiciliary regulations. Argo Re is the primary direct subsidiary of Argo Group and is subject to Bermuda insurance laws. Argo Ireland is indirectly owned by Argo Re and is a mid-level holding company subject to Irish laws, and its primary subsidiary is Argo Group US, Inc. Argo Group US, Inc. is a mid-level holding company subject to Delaware laws. Argo Group US, Inc. is the parent of all of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, Argo Re paid a cash dividend of $41.0 million to Argo Group which was used to repay intercompany balances related primarily to dividend and interest payments and other corporate expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Argo Group US received dividends of $35.0 million from Colony, of which $15.1 million was paid in the form of investment securities with the remaining $19.9 million paid in cash, $41.6 million from Argonaut Insurance Company and $18.1 million from Rockwood. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Argo Group US, Inc. paid a cash dividend of $38.0 million, net of $2.0 million in Irish withholding taxes, to Argo Re through its direct parent, Argo Ireland.\nThe payment of dividends by Argo Re is limited under Bermuda insurance laws which require Argo Re to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, the unaudited statutory capital and surplus of Argo Re was estimated to be $1,510.8 million and the amount required to be maintained was estimated to be $362.1 million, thereby allowing Argo Re the potential to pay dividends or capital distributions within the parameters of the solvency and liquidity margins. We believe that the dividend and capital distribution capacity of Argo Re will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet the operating and debt service commitments, as well as other obligations.\nDuring 2017, Argo Group US, Inc. may be permitted to receive dividends from its subsidiaries as follows: Argonaut Insurance Company - $80.0 million and Rockwood - $11.3 million. Business and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid and prior approval of dividend payments may be required.\nOn March 7, 2014, each of Argo Group, Argo Group US, Inc., Argo International Holdings Limited, and Argo Underwriting Agency Limited (the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a $175 million credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $175.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 7, 2018 unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and permitted acquisitions, and each of the Borrowers has agreed to be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the other Borrowers under the Credit Agreement.\nEffective February 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Maybrooke Holdings, S.A. for $235.3 million. We drew $125.0 million under our Credit Agreement in order to help fund the acquisition and paid the remaining $110.3 million with available cash on hand.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers could be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least a majority of the loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. No defaults or events of defaults have occurred as of the date of this filing.\nIncluded in the Credit Agreement is a provision that allows up to $17.5 million of the revolving credit facility to be used for letters of credit ( LOCs\u201d), subject to availability. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding and $0.2 million in LOCs against the Credit Facility.\nLOCs have been filed with Lloyd's by trade capital providers as part of the terms of whole account quota share reinsurance contracts entered into by the trade capital providers. In the event such LOCs are funded, the outstanding balance would be the responsibility of the trade capital providers.\nUnder certain insurance programs (i.e., large deductible programs and surety bonds) and various reinsurance agreements, collateral and LOCs are held for our benefit to secure performance of insureds and reinsurers in meeting their obligations. At December 31, 2016, the amount of such collateral and LOCs held under insurance and reinsurance agreements were $839.7 million and $492.6 million, respectively. Collateral can be provided in the form of trust accounts. As we are the beneficiary of these trust accounts only to secure future performance, these amounts are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Collateral provided by an insured or reinsurer may exceed or fall below their total outstanding obligation.\nThrough a series of trusts, that are wholly-owned subsidiaries (non-consolidated), we issued trust preferred securities. The interest on the underlying debentures is variable with the rates being reset quarterly and subject to certain interest rate ceilings. Interest payments are payable quarterly. The debentures are all unsecured and are subordinated to other indebtedness. All are redeemable subject to certain terms and conditions at a price equal to 100% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn July 16, 2014, Argo Group US, Inc. purchased the outstanding PXRE Capital Trust V $20,000,000 Junior Subordinated Debt Securities ( Capital Trust V\u201d) at a price equal to 90.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of purchase for a total price of $18.2 million, resulting in the recognition of a $2.0 million pre-tax realized gain.\nA summary of our outstanding junior subordinated debentures at December 31, 2016 is presented below:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issue Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Trust Preferred Pools\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate Structure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest Rate at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Argo Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 05/15/2003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PXRE Capital Statutory Trust II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 05/15/2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 4.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 11/06/2003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PXRE Capital Trust VI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 09/30/2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.90%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.90%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Argo Group US\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 05/15/2003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 05/15/2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 4.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 12/16/2003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust III\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 01/08/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 4.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 04/29/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust IV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 04/29/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 05/26/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust V\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 05/24/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 05/12/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust VI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 05/12/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.80%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 09/17/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust VII\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/15/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 09/22/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust VIII\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 09/22/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10/22/2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust IX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/15/2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 09/15/2005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Argonaut Group Statutory Trust X\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 09/15/2035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3M LIBOR + 3.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe assumed debt through the acquisition of Syndicate 1200.

Cash dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $26.6 million.\nOn May 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable on June 15, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2016. As a result of the stock dividend, 2,735,542 additional shares were issued. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of our common shares. All references to share and per share amounts in this document and related disclosures have been adjusted to reflect the stock dividend for all periods presented.\nOn February 17, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable on March 16, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2015. Shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nOn May 3, 2016, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common shares ( 2016 Repurchase Authorization\u201d). The 2016 Repurchase Authorization supersedes all the previous repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2016, availability under the 2016 Repurchase Authorization for future repurchases of our common shares was $130.3 million.\nWe invest excess cash in a variety of investment securities. As of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted of 67.8% fixed maturities, 10.3% equity securities, 12.5% other investments and 9.4% short-term investments (based on fair value) compared to 71.1% fixed maturities, 11.3% equity securities, 12.5% other investments and 5.1% short-term investments as of December 31, 2015. We classify the majority of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale; resulting in these investments being reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, being reported as a component of shareholders' equity. At December 31, 2016, no investments were designated as trading. No issuer (excluding United States Government and United States Governmental agencies) of fixed maturity or equity securities represents more than 4.7% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016.\nOur insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries require liquidity and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants and fund operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flow provided by operations was $181.4 million. Based on current premium volumes and other measures of capital deployed in our business, we determined we had excess capital and, therefore, returned capital to our shareholders through the share buy-back program and through dividend payments to our shareholders. We believe our liquidity generated from operations and, if required, from our investment portfolio, will be sufficient to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future. We believe we have access to various sources of liquidity including cash, investments and the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, we continue to have access to the debt and equity markets, though we currently do not foresee needing access to these sources of capital.\nWe believe we maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and expenses, as well as satisfy our commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reinsurer insolvencies, inadequate premium rates or reserve deficiencies.\nWe maintain a comprehensive reinsurance program at levels management considers adequate to diversify risk and safeguard our financial position. Increases in the costs of this program, or the failure of our reinsurers to meet their obligations in a timely fashion, may have a negative impact on liquidity.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nThe discussion of transactions with related parties is included in Note 22, Transactions with Related Parties\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d beginning on page.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have committed to invest up to a total of $433.7 million in a series of hedge funds, private equity and long only funds, of which $340.3 million was funded and included in Other invested assets in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, we have a remaining obligation to the private equity partnerships to invest up to an additional $93.4 million, which can be called at any time. We have not recorded this commitment in our consolidated financial statements. The investment will be recorded at such time as the capital partnership requires the additional investment. Additionally, we have not recorded the liabilities for our operating leases in our consolidated financial statements.\nOther than as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K at December 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 -

Unless otherwise specified below, the term loss reserves\u201d encompasses reserves for both losses and LAE. Loss reserves reflect management's best estimate. Loss reserves established are not an exact calculation of our liability. Rather, loss reserves represent management's best estimate of our liability based on application of actuarial techniques and other projection methodologies and taking into consideration other facts and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. The process of establishing loss reserves is complex and necessarily imprecise, as it involves using judgment that is impacted by many internal and external variables such as past loss experience, current claim trends and the prevailing social, economic and legal environments. In determining loss reserves, we give careful consideration to all available data and applicable actuarial analyses.\nThe relevant factors and methodologies used to estimate loss reserves vary significantly by product line due to differences in loss exposure and claim complexity. Much of our business is underwritten on an occurrence basis, which can lead to a significant time lag between the event that gives rise to a claim and the date on which the claim is reported to us. Additional time may be required to resolve the claim once it is reported to us. During these time lags, which can span several years for complex claims, new facts and information specific to the claim become known to us. In addition, general econometric and societal trends including inflation may change. Any one of these factors may require us to refine our loss reserve estimates on a regular basis. We apply a strict regimen to assure that review of these facts and trends occurs on a timely basis so that this information can be factored into our estimate of future liabilities. However, due to the number and potential magnitude of these variables, actual paid losses in future periods may differ materially from our estimates as reflected in current reserves. These differences can be favorable or unfavorable. A more precise estimation of loss reserves is also hindered by the effects of growth in a line of business and uncertainty as to how new business performs in relation to expectations established through analysis of the existing portfolio. In addition to reserving for known claim events, we also establish loss reserves for IBNR. Loss reserves for IBNR are set using our actuarial estimates for events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date but have yet been reported to us. Estimation of IBNR loss reserves is subject to significant uncertainty.\nFollowing is a summary of gross and net loss reserves we recorded by line of business:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,529.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,028.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,423.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 948.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 571.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 312.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 575.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 322.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 323.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 293.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 270.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 163.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fidelity/Surety\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinsurance - nonproportional assumed\nproperty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 marine & energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 159.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,350.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,133.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss Reserve Estimation Methods\nThe process for estimating our loss reserves begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. The data collected for actuarial analyses includes reported claims, paid losses and case reserve estimates sorted by the year the loss occurred. The data sets are sorted into homogeneous groupings, exhibiting similar loss and exposure characteristics. We primarily use internal data in the analysis but also consider industry data in developing factors and estimates. We analyze loss reserves on a quarterly basis.\nWe use a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to determine loss reserves for all lines of business. Each method has its own set of assumptions, and each has strengths and weaknesses depending on the exposures being evaluated. Since no single estimation method is superior to another method in all situations, the methods and assumptions used to project loss reserves will vary by line of business and, when appropriate, by where we attach on a risk. We use what we believe to be the most appropriate set of actuarial methods and assumptions for each product line grouping. While the loss projection methods may vary by product line, the general approach for calculating IBNR remains the same: ultimate losses are forecasted first, and that amount is reduced by the amount of cumulative paid claims and case reserves.\nWhen we initially establish IBNR reserves at the beginning of an accident year for each line of business, we often use the expected loss ratio method. This method is based upon our analyses of historical loss ratios incorporating adjustments for pricing changes, anticipated loss ratio trends, changes in mix of business and any other factors that may impact loss ratio expectations. At the end of each quarter, we review the loss ratio selections and the emerged loss experience to determine if deviating from the loss ratio method is appropriate. In general, we continue to use the loss ratio method until we deem it appropriate to begin to rely on the experience of the accident year ( AY\u201d) being evaluated. This weighing in of the AY experience is typically done by employing the Bornhuetter-Ferguson ( BF\u201d) reserving methodology. The BF methods compute IBNR through a blend of the expected loss ratio method and traditional loss development methods. The BF methods estimate IBNR for an accident year as the product of expected losses (earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio) plus an expected percentage of unreported losses. The expected percentage of unreported losses is derived from age-to-ultimate loss development factors that result from our analyses of loss development triangles.\nAs accident years mature to the point at which the reported loss experience is more credible, we assign increasing weight to the paid and incurred loss development methods.\nFor short-tail lines of business such as property, we generally defer to the AY loss experience more quickly as the time from claim occurrence to reporting is generally short. In the event there are large claims incurred, we will analyze large loss information separately to ensure that the loss reserving methods appropriately recognize the magnitude of these losses in the evaluation of ultimate losses.\nFor long-tail lines such as general liability and automobile liability, the loss experience is not deemed fully credible for several years. At the end of the accident year, we rely primarily on the BF methods and continue to rely on those methods for several years. We assign greater weight to the paid and incurred development methods as the data matures.\nWorkers compensation is also a long-tail line of business, and is reserved for in keeping with other long-tailed business. However, a portion of the outstanding reserves correspond to scheduled indemnity payments and are not subject to extreme volatility. The portion of reserves that is not scheduled or annuitized is subject to potentially large variations in ultimate loss cost due to the uncertainty of medical cost inflation. Sources of medical cost inflation include increased utilization, new and more expensive medical testing procedures and prescription drugs costs.\nWe have a Run-off Lines segment that includes reserves for asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures. These latent exposures are typically characterized by extended periods of time between the dates an insured is first exposed to a loss, a claim is reported and the claim is resolved. For our Run-off Lines segment long-tail loss reserves, there is significant uncertainty involved in estimating reserves for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. We use several methods to estimate reserves for these claims including an approach that projects future calendar period claims and average claim costs, a report year method which estimates loss reserves based on the pattern and magnitude of reported claims and ground-up analysis that relies on an evaluation of individual policy terms and conditions. We also consider survival ratio and market share methods which compare our level of loss reserves and loss payments to that of the industry for similar exposures. We apply greatest weight to the method that projects future calendar period claims and average claim costs because we believe it best captures the unique claim characteristics of our underlying exposures and loss development potential. We perform a full review of our Run-off Lines asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures loss reserves at least once a year and review loss activity quarterly for significant changes that might impact management's best estimate.\nEach business segment is analyzed individually, with development characteristics for each short-tail and long-tail line of business identified and applied accordingly. In comparing loss reserve methods and assumptions used at December 31, 2016 as compared with methods and assumptions used at December 31, 2015, management has not changed or adjusted methodologies or assumptions in any significant manner.\nIn conducting our actuarial analyses, we generally assume that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves and that the data provides a basis for estimating future loss reserves. In the event that we become aware of a material change that may render past experience inappropriate for the purpose of estimating current loss reserves, we will attempt to quantify the effect of the change and use informed management judgment to adjust loss reserve forecasts appropriately.\nUncertainties in Loss Reserve Estimation\nThe causes of uncertainty will vary for each product line reviewed. For short-tail property lines of business, we are exposed to catastrophe losses, both natural and manmade. Due to the nature of certain catastrophic loss events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes or terrorist attacks, our normal claims resolution processes may be impaired due to factors such as difficulty in accessing impacted areas and other physical, legal and regulatory impediments. These factors can make establishment of accurate loss reserve estimates difficult and render such estimates subject to greater uncertainty. Additionally, if the catastrophe occurs near the end of a financial reporting period, there are additional uncertainties in loss reserve estimates due to the lack of sufficient time to conduct a thorough analysis. Long-tail casualty lines of business also present challenges in establishing appropriate loss reserves, for example if changes in the legal environment occur over time which broaden our liability or scope of policy coverage and increase the magnitude of claim payments.\nIn all lines, final claim payments may differ from the established loss reserve. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and could have a material adverse or beneficial effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any adjustments to loss reserves are reflected in the results for the year during which the adjustments are made.\nIn addition to the previously described general uncertainties encountered in estimating loss reserves, there are significant additional uncertainties in estimating the amount of our potential losses from asbestos and environmental claims. Loss reserves for asbestos and environmental claims normally cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year development factors due to the uncertainties surrounding these types of claims. Among the uncertainties impacting the estimation of such losses are:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potentially long waiting periods between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> difficulty in identifying sources of environmental or asbestos contamination and in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for damage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential for an environmental or asbestos claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> long reporting delays from insureds to insurance companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> historical data concerning asbestos and environmental losses which is more limited than historical information on other types of claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance coverage; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCase reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation have been established where sufficient information has been developed. Additionally, IBNR has been established to cover additional exposure on known and unknown claims.\nWe underwrite environmental and pollution coverage on a limited number of policies and underground storage tanks. We establish loss reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us.\nRisk Factors by Line of Business in Loss Reserve Estimation\nThe following section details reserving considerations and loss and LAE risk factors for the lines representing most of our loss reserves. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required loss reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required loss reserves. For example, introduction and approval of a more expensive medical procedure may result in higher estimates for medical costs. But in the workers compensation context, the availability of that same medical procedure may enable workers to return to work more quickly, thereby lowering estimates for indemnity costs for that line of business. As a result, it usually is not possible to identify and measure the impact that a change in one discrete risk factor may have or construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation around it. We do not make explicit estimates of the impact on loss reserve estimates for the assumptions related to the risk factors described below.\nLoss adjustment expenses used in connection with our loss reserves are comprised of both allocated and unallocated expenses. Allocated loss adjustment expenses generally relate to specific claim files. We often combine allocated loss adjustment expenses with losses for purposes of projecting ultimate liabilities. For some types of claims, such as asbestos, environmental and professional liability, allocated loss adjustment expenses consisting primarily of legal defense costs may be significant, sometimes exceeding the liability to indemnify claimants for losses. Unallocated loss adjustment expenses generally relate to the administration and handling of claims in the ordinary course of business. We typically calculate unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves using a percentage of unpaid losses for each line of business.\nGeneral Liability\nGeneral liability is considered a long-tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and resolve all claims from a given accident year. The speed at which claims are received and then resolved is a function of the specific coverage provided, jurisdiction in which the claim is located and specific policy provisions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payout patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years, while others are characterized by extreme time lags for both reporting and payment of claims. In addition, this line includes asbestos and environmental claims, which are reviewed separately because of the unique character of these exposures. Allocated loss adjustment expenses in this line consist primarily of legal costs and may exceed the total amount of the indemnity loss on some claims.\nMajor factors contributing to uncertainty in loss reserve estimates for general liability include reporting lags (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, events triggering coverage that are spread over multiple time periods, the inability to know in advance what actual indemnity\ncosts will be associated with an individual claim, the potential for disputes over whether claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were underwritten and the potential for mass tort claims and class actions. Generally, claims with a longer reporting lag time are characterized by greater inherent risk of uncertainty.\nExamples of loss and LAE risk factors associated with general liability claims that can change over time and result in adjustments to loss reserves include, but are not limited to, the following:\nClaims risk factors:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in claim handling procedures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> New theories of liability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Trends in jury awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the propensity to sue, in general and with specificity to particular issues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in statutes of limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the underlying court system;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in tort law;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Shifts in law suit mix between U.S. federal and state courts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in inflation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBook of Business risk factors:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in underwriting standards; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nActuarial methods used to forecast ultimate liabilities for general liability are adjusted to take into consideration the uncertainties related to handling claims expected to remain open for an extended period of time as well as the Claims and Book of Business risk factors noted above.\nWorkers Compensation\nWorkers compensation is generally considered a long-tail coverage as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. Certain payments, such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker, are generally disbursed quickly. Other payments may be made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. Some payments continue to take place throughout the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Although long-tail in nature, claims generally are not subject to long reporting lags, settlements are generally not complex and most of the liability exposure is characterized by high frequency and moderate severity. The largest reserve risks are generally associated with low frequency, high severity claims that require lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury.\nExamples of loss and LAE risk factors that can change over time and cause workers compensation loss reserves to fluctuate include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIndemnity claims risk factors:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Time required to recover from the injury;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Degree of available transitional jobs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Degree of legal involvement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions' oversight of claim;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Future wage inflation for U.S. states that index benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in benefit levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMedical claims risk factors:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the cost of medical treatments, including prescription drugs, and underlying fee schedules;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Frequency of visits to health providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Types of health providers used;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Type of medical treatments received;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Availability of new medical processes and equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in life expectancy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBook of Business risk factors:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Injury type mix;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in underwriting standards; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changing product mix based on insured demand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSyndicate 1200 Liability and Property\nSyndicate 1200 Liability is a long-tail line, and the risk factors are the same as discussed for General Liability except that Syndicate 1200 Liability does not include asbestos and environmental claims. Syndicate 1200 Property is a short-tail line. In general, paid and incurred loss development methods are used to forecast property losses.\nWe perform our loss reserve analysis on a syndicate basis, which represents 100% of the business underwritten by the syndicate. We use reinsurance to cede a proportion of its premium income and incurred losses to reinsurers. The percentage of the cession differs for each underwriting year of account. The reinsurers' share of provisions for claims is based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR, net of estimated unrecoverable amounts. Syndicate 1200 evaluates the reinsurance program in place for the class of business, claims experience for the year and security rating of the reinsurance companies involved.\nCommercial Multiple Peril\nCommercial multiple peril lines insure a combination of property and liability exposures, and therefore, include both short and long-tail coverage. Property coverage claims are generally resolved in a short period of time, while liability coverage claims generally require more time to resolve. The risk of fluctuation in loss reserves for this line is predominately associated with liability coverage with risk factors similar to other general liability lines described above.\nBecause commercial multiple peril lines involve both short-tail and long-tail coverage, we give weight to different methodologies in deriving estimated loss reserves based on the coverage being evaluated. In general, paid and incurred loss development methods are used to forecast property losses. For liability losses, due to the Claims and Book of Business risk factors described in the General Liability section above, we use several loss reserving methods to capture the development characteristics associated with these lines of business. Paid and incurred loss development, paid and incurred BF methods and a loss frequency/severity method are used in deriving estimated loss reserves.\nCommercial Automobile Liability\nThe commercial automobile liability product line is a long-tail coverage, mainly due to exposures arising out of bodily injury claims. Losses in this line associated with bodily injury claims generally are more difficult to accurately estimate and take longer to resolve.\nClaim reporting lags also can occur. Examples of loss and LAE risk factors that can change over time and result in adjustments to commercial automobile liability loss reserves include, but are not limited to, the following:\nClaims risk factors:\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Trends in jury awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the underlying court system;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in case law;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Litigation trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subrogation opportunities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in claim handling procedures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Frequency of visits to health providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Types of health providers used;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Types of medical treatments received;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in cost of medical treatments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBook of Business risk factors:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in mix of insured vehicles; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in underwriting standards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gasoline prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in macroeconomic factors including but not limited to unemployment statistics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance - Nonproportional Assumed Property\nAs a property catastrophe reinsurer, incurred losses are inherently more volatile than those of primary insurers and reinsurers of risks that have an established historical pattern of loss development. The most significant uncertainty in reserves involves estimates of catastrophe losses. In reserving for catastrophe losses, estimates are influenced by underwriting and claim information provided by clients, clients' market shares, industry catastrophe models, industry loss estimates and internal analyses of this information. This reserving approach can cause significant development from initial loss estimates in the immediate wake of a catastrophe event due to the limited information available to us as a reinsurer regarding the actual underlying losses. This process can cause the ultimate estimates to differ significantly from initial projections.\nThe loss estimation process often begins with the identification of events with characteristics similar to the recent catastrophe (geographic location, wind speed, damageability, etc.), which then results in a list of the expected losses by contract from our proprietary risk management system. Third-party modeling software is embedded in our proprietary risk management system.\nConcurrently, underwriting teams employ a market share approach as well as perform a thorough contract by contract analysis to identify potential changes to the expected loss estimates including IBNR by contract. The results of this initial process are updated when additional information becomes available. This information comes in the form of publicly available announcements, informal contact with brokers and/or clients, submission data and formal claim notices. As catastrophic events mature and reporting loss methods become more credible, sometimes as much as six to twelve months after the event or more, estimates of ultimate loss will rely more heavily on the actual claim experience arising from the event. In evaluating the loss estimates for catastrophic events, we use internal databases to establish projected reporting and payment patterns. Industry patterns from the Reinsurance Association of America ( RAA\u201d), an insurance industry organization, are also employed.\nImpact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility\nWe estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. The reserve estimation process includes explicit assumptions about a number of factors in the internal and external environment. Across most lines of business, the most important assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss costs is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.\nThe following discussion includes disclosure of possible variations from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions. Each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among other key assumptions or among lines of business. Therefore, it could be misleading to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for reserves in total. The estimated variations in reserves due to changes in key assumptions discussed below are a reasonable estimate of possible variations that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. It is important to note that the variations discussed herein are not exhaustive and are not meant to be a worst or best case scenario, and therefore, it is possible that future variations may be more than amounts discussed below.\nRecorded gross reserves for general liability were $1,529.7 million, with approximately 3% of that amount related to run-off asbestos and environmental exposures as of December 31, 2016. For general liability losses relating to ongoing operations, reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for this line of business. Historically, assumptions on reported loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) or a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims. We have reviewed the historical variation in reported loss development patterns for general liability losses deriving from continuing operations. If the reported loss development patterns change by 10%, a change that we have experienced in the past and that management considers possible, the estimated net reserve could change by $65.0 million, in either direction.\nSimilar to general liability, commercial multiple peril reserves are affected by reported loss development pattern assumptions. Recorded gross reserves for commercial multiple peril business were $270.6 million as of December 31, 2016. If the development patterns underlying our net reserves for this line of business change by 10%, the estimated net reserve could change by $10.0 million, in either direction.\nRecorded gross reserves for workers compensation were $571.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The two most important assumptions for workers compensation reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends, particularly medical cost inflation. Loss development patterns are dependent on medical cost inflation. Approximately 60% of the workers compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs. A review of National Council on Compensation Insurance data suggests that the annual growth in industry medical claim costs has varied from -2% to +13% since 1991. Across the entire reserve base, a 1% change in calendar year medical inflation could change the estimated net reserve by $15.0 million, in either direction.\nRecorded gross reserves for commercial auto liability were $123.7 million as of December 31, 2016. A key assumption for commercial lines auto liability is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. A 3% change in assumed annual severity is within the range of our historical experience and which management considers possible. A 3% change in assumed annual severity could change the estimated net reserve by $10.0 million, in either direction.\nRecorded gross reserves for the Syndicate 1200 segment were $657.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Estimation of our international liability reserves are subject to late emergence and mix shifts between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims. Our international property reserves are analyzed by the characteristics of the underlying exposures. Property loss reserves are characterized by relatively short periods between occurrence, reporting, determination of coverage and ultimate claims settlement. These property loss reserves tend to be the most predictable. Catastrophic loss reserves tend to exhibit more volatility due to the nature of the underlying loss event which may cause delays and complexity in estimating ultimate loss exposure.\nWith respect to asbestos and environmental general liability losses, we wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and environmental claims. First, we wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured's general liability insurance program. Second, we wrote excess policies providing higher layers of general liability insurance coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, we acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks from other insurers underwriting primary, excess and reinsurance coverage. Fourth, we participated in the London Market, underwriting both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business. With regard to both environmental and asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in a state of continued uncertainty. The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these types of exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional general liability exposures, and as such, we believe there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos and environmental loss reserves.\nIn the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs' expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation and inconsistent emerging legal outcomes. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including Argo Group, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, claims experience of particular insureds and value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For example, in the past, insurers in general, including Argo Group, have experienced an increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs' increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including pre-packaged\u201d bankruptcies, to accelerate the funding and amount of loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders continue to assert new classes of claims for coverage to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other insurers and reinsurers, delays in the reporting of new claims by insurers and reinsurers and unanticipated issues influencing our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.\nIn the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.\nThe reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and environmental claims is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder's own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.\nThe factors discussed above affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, average severity of those claims settled with payment, dismissal rate of claims with no payment and expense to indemnity ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size of the range of reserves we have developed, that range may still not be indicative of the potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves, which is detailed in Note 6, Run-off Lines,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties. Due to these uncertainties, further developments could cause us to change our estimates and ranges of our asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nLoss Reserve Estimation Variability\nAfter reviewing the output from various loss reserving methodologies, we select our best estimate of reserves. We believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2016 were adequate to cover claims for losses that have occurred, including both known claims and claims yet to be reported. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded gross loss reserves of $3,350.8 million and loss reserves net of reinsurance of $2,180.2 million. Although our financial reports reflect our best estimate of reserves, it is unlikely that the final amount paid will exactly equal our best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability in loss reserve estimates, we develop reserve ranges by evaluating the variability implied by the results of the various methods and impact of changing the assumptions and factors used in the loss reserving process.\nWe estimate our range of reserves, net of reinsurance, at approximately $2,000 million to $2,420 million as of December 31, 2016. In determining this range, we evaluated the variability of the loss reserves for each of our major operating segments, comprising both ongoing operations and run-off businesses. Our estimated range does not make a specific provision for sources of unknown or unanticipated correlated events such as potential sources of liability not anticipated at the time coverage was afforded, such as asbestos. These events in combination with other events which may not be contemplated by management in developing our range may cause reserves to develop either more or less favorably than indicated by assumptions that we consider reasonable. This means that the range of reserve values does not represent the range of all possible favorable or unfavorable reserve outcomes, and actual ultimate paid losses may fall outside this range. No one risk factor has been isolated for the purpose of performing a sensitivity or variability analysis on that particular risk factor.\nIn establishing our best estimate for reserves, we consider facts currently known and the present judicial and legislative environment. However, given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts, legislatures in the recent past and possibility of similar interpretations in the future, particularly with regard to asbestos and environmental claims, additional loss reserves may develop in future periods. These potential increases cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time. Any increases could have an adverse impact on future operating results, liquidity, risk-based capital ratios and ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries by the nationally recognized insurance rating agencies.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments in fixed maturities and stocks are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are not recognized in income during the period, but rather are recognized as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. Fair values of these investments are estimated using prices obtained from third-party pricing services, where available. For securities where we are unable to obtain fair values from a pricing service or broker, fair values are estimated using information obtained from investment advisors. Management performed several processes to ascertain the reasonableness of investment values included in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2016, including i) obtaining and reviewing internal control reports for our accounting service providers that obtain fair values from third-party pricing services, ii) discussing with our investment managers their process for reviewing and validating pricing obtained from outside services and obtained values for all securities from our investment managers and iii) comparing the security pricing received from the investment managers with the prices used in our consolidated financial statements and obtained additional information for variances that exceeded a certain threshold. As of December 31, 2016, investments classified as available-for-sale for which we did not receive a fair value from a pricing service or broker accounted for less than 1% of our investment portfolio. The actual value at which such securities could be sold or settled with a willing buyer or seller may differ from such estimated fair values depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, current and future economic conditions, the quantity sold or settled, the presence of an active market and the availability of a willing buyer or seller. Our investments in hedge and private equity funds and other private equity direct investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with changes in the value of investments recognized in net investment income during the period. We have one available-for-sale private equity investment with changes in the value of investment recognized as a separate component of shareholders' equity. We also have two small private equity investments accounted for at cost.\nWe regularly monitor the difference between the estimated fair values of our investments and their cost or book values to identify underperforming investments and whether declines in value are temporary in nature or other-than-temporary.\u201d If a decline in the value of a particular investment is believed to be temporary, the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss, net of tax, in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity. If the decline is believed to be other-than-temporary,\u201d the carrying value of the investment is written down and recorded as a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We evaluate our investments for impairment. For fixed maturities securities, the evaluation for a credit loss is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows of the security as compared to the amortized book value. For mortgage-backed securities, frequency and severity inputs are used in projecting future cash flows of the securities. Loss frequency is measured as the credit default rate, which includes such factors as loan-to-value ratios and credit scores of borrowers. Loss severity includes such factors as trends in overall housing prices and house prices that are obtained at foreclosure. For equity securities, the length of time and the amount of decline in fair value are the principal factors in determining other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded $10.2 million, $11.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of realized losses due to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of Argo Group's United States, Brazil, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, Malta and United Kingdom subsidiaries' assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse. The components of our deferred tax asset are temporary differences primarily attributable to loss reserve discounting and unearned premium reserves. Our deferred tax liabilities resulted primarily from unrealized gains in the investment portfolio, deferred acquisition costs and depreciable fixed assets.\nThe evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies. If our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax-paying component prove to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFor additional information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities, please see Note 15 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d beginning on page.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, including Goodwill\nWe perform annual impairment tests of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, or more frequently when impairment indicators exist. We have elected to perform our goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. The goodwill impairment test is determined using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill (\u2018Step 1\u201d). If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step ( Step 2\u201d) is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. Step 2 compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill, then a charge is recorded to reduce goodwill to the implied goodwill. The implied goodwill is calculated based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation, similar to the requirements in the accounting guidance for business combinations, whereby the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $152.2 million assigned to the following reporting units: Excess and Surplus lines - $68.4 million, Commercial Specialty - $55.1 million and Syndicate 1200 - $28.7 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had other intangible assets totaling $67.7 million, including indefinite-lived intangible assets of $60.5 million in the Syndicate 1200 segment. Due to the nature of the Syndicate 1200 segment's business, for purposes of the annual impairment evaluation, we have aggregated the fair values between the indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill.\nFor purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, we determined that our reporting units are the same as our business segments because all components of each segment are similar and none of the components were determined to be separate reporting units. Additionally, each business segment has discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance. We allocated the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities of our reporting units consistent with our business segment reporting and prior periods. No material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill were made during 2016.\nThe fair value of reporting units was estimated using an average of three valuation methods: a comparable company analysis, precedent transaction analysis and discounted cash flow analysis. All three methods require us to make various judgments and assumptions including but not limited to: (i) market dynamics affecting each segment such as the competitive environment, pricing cycle and pricing outlook; the economy and interest rates, (ii) projections of earned premiums, losses, expenses and cash flows, and (iii) discount rates and valuation multiples. Assumptions about future cash flows are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data. Finally, the comparable company analysis and precedent transaction analysis required judgment in selecting comparable companies and comparable transactions for use in the calculations. These judgments and assumptions, and the outcomes in which they result, are potentially subject to material change based on factors, dynamics and influences outside our control. In all instances, future changes in these judgments and assumptions could cause impairment of goodwill.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, all of our reporting units passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment analysis as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of their carrying values. Therefore, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis was not required. Any decline in the fair value of these reporting units could result in the carrying value of the reporting unit being in excess of fair value, triggering Step 2 of the impairment testing model, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.\nAs noted above, we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. An impairment analysis subsequent to this date has not been performed as we believe that no additional indicators of impairment have arisen, such as significant additional pricing competition, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or further significant decline in market capitalization.\nOur market capitalization has increased in 2016, as our stock has traded at or above book value in the fourth quarter of 2016. We considered the market capitalization as one of the data points in performing our annual impairment test. We consider the changes in our market capitalization to be primarily attributable to global financial market conditions, as well as current trends within the insurance industry. The valuation analysis discussed above supports our view that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not impaired at October 1, 2016. Through December 31, 2016, there have been no indicators of impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. During 2017, we will monitor relevant internal and external factors and their potential impact on the fair value of our reporting segments, and if required, we will update our impairment analysis.\nWhile we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable in determining the fair value of reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform Step 2 in future periods and impairment of goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived assets could result. We cannot predict future events that might impact the fair value of reporting units and goodwill impairment. Such events include, but are not limited to, increased competition in insurance markets and global economic changes.\nWe evaluated our definite lived intangibles for indicators of impairment. If indicators of impairment had been identified, we would have been required to test definite lived intangible assets for impairment. As of October 1, 2016, the testing date, no indicators of impairment were identified. Therefore, we were not required to test for impairment. As with the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we will continue to monitor for indicators of impairment and test as required.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial results and operations of a company for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors described in this report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $146.7 million, or $4.75 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $163.2 million, or $5.20 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $183.2 million, or $5.70 per fully diluted share.\nThe following is a comparison of select data from our results of operations:\n\nThe increase in consolidated gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended in 2015 and 2014 was primarily the result of increased premiums in all segments with the exception of International Specialty as our property reinsurance book was adversely impacted by increased competition and declining rates. All segments were impacted to some degree by increasing competition and, in some cases, declining rates, with our International Specialty and Syndicate 1200 segments being the most impacted by this competition. Net written premiums increased within our Excess and Surplus Lines and Commercial Specialty segments due to the increases in gross written premiums and increased risk retention. Net written premiums for our International Specialty segment declined in 2016 due to the reduction in gross written premiums, partially offset by increased risk retention. Net written premiums for the Syndicate 1200 segment declined in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 due to reductions in our participation percentages, partially offset by increased risk retention. The increase in consolidated earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 was due to the increase in gross and net written premiums.\nThe increase in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $20.9 million increase in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.9 million for the same period ended 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we evaluated our accounting for income from our alternative investment portfolio and determined that as we manage these investments to appreciate in value on a quarter to quarter basis, it is more appropriate to classify the change in value as net investment income as opposed to realized investment gains (losses). All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income increased $5.6 million from $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $91.2 million for the same period ended 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in income on our fixed maturity portfolio, partially offset by increased investment related expenses. The decline in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to a $16.5 million decrease in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.0 million for the same period ended 2015. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income was comparable at $85.6 million and $86.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total invested assets at December 31, 2016 were $4,192.4 million, net of $131.9 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2015 were $4,020.4 million, net of $95.3 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2014 were $4,022.7 million, net of $75.2 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers.\nConsolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $62.0 million in realized gains primarily from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $25.7 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $10.2 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $38.9 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $3.1 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an $11.9 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $34.3 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities and a $43.3 million gain from the sale of an investment property. Partially offsetting these realized gains was a\n$2.3 million realized loss from the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments within our equity and fixed maturity portfolio. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our investment portfolio was negligible for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses were $810.1 million, $766.1 million and $747.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the consolidated loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was attributable to increased catastrophe losses. The consolidated loss ratios were comparable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily due to improved current accident year losses in 2015, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses and reduced net favorable reserve development on prior accident years.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2016 were $63.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, including Hurricane Matthew and the Louisiana floods, the Alberta wildfires and the Taiwan and New Zealand earthquakes. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $33.3 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, which is presented in the table below.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2015 were $24.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from United States and other storm activity, and the Tianjin explosion. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $32.4 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line, our Syndicate 1200 liability lines and our commercial automobile lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in our workers compensation and commercial multi-peril lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2014 was $18.7 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, various hailstorms, Typhoon Rammasum and Hurricane Odile. Partially offsetting these 2014 accident year losses was $37.7 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line and our Syndicate 1200 liability and property lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in the commercial multi-peril and commercial automobile lines.\nThe following table summarizes the above referenced loss reserve development as respects prior year loss reserves by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\nIn determining appropriate reserve levels for the year ended December 31, 2016, we maintained the same general processes and disciplines that were used to set reserves at prior reporting dates. No significant changes in methodologies were made to estimate the reserves since the last reporting date; however, at each reporting date we reassess the actuarial estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses and record our best estimate. Consistent with prior reserve valuations, as claims data becomes more mature for prior accident years, actuarial estimates were refined to weigh certain actuarial methods more heavily in order to respond to any emerging trends in the paid and reported loss data. While prior accident years' net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for some lines of business have developed favorably in recent years, this does not imply that more recent accident years' reserves also will develop favorably; pricing, reinsurance costs, legal environment, general economic conditions including changes in inflation and many other factors impact our ultimate loss estimates.\nConsolidated gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were $3,350.8 million (including $156.1 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), $3,123.6 million (including $102.3 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), and $3,042.4 million (including $80.3 million of reserves attributable to the trade capital providers) as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management has recorded its best estimate of loss reserves at each\ndate based on current known facts and circumstances. Due to the significant uncertainties inherent in the estimation of loss reserves, there can be no assurance that future loss development, favorable or unfavorable, will not occur.\nConsolidated underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses were $547.0 million, $536.7 million and $537.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in the expense ratio for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commissions received, reduced contingent commissions payable and lower equity stock compensation expenses, partially offset by increased premium taxes and assessment expenses. The decline in the consolidated expense ratio for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to lower acquisition cost primarily attributable to lower premium taxes, fees and assessments coupled with increased ceding commissions received. Non-acquisition cost increased due to higher compensation and information technology costs, partially offset by lower outside services expense.\nConsolidated interest expense was $19.6 million, $19.0 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of slightly higher interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments. The decline in consolidated interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was the result of slightly reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments.\nConsolidated foreign currency exchange gains were $4.5 million $18.3 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The changes in the foreign currency exchange gains were due to fluctuations of the U.S Dollar, on a weighted average basis, against the currencies in which we transact our business.\nThe consolidated provisions for income taxes were $35.2 million, $14.3 million and $32.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The consolidated income tax provision represents the income tax expense associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, the consolidated provision for income taxes represents taxes on net income for our United States, Ireland, Belgium, Brazil, Switzerland and United Kingdom operations. The consolidated effective tax rates were 19.4%, 8.1% and 15.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax income in the United States. Pretax income for our United States operations increased to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $64.8 million for the same period ended 2015. The decline in the consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced taxable pretax income in the United States while permanent tax differences remained consistent. Pretax income was higher in 2014, due to the recognition in 2014 of a $43.3 million realized gain from the sale of property. Additionally, our United Kingdom operations reported a tax benefit for 2015, primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.\nSegment Results\nWe are primarily engaged in writing property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. We have four ongoing reporting segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200. Additionally, we have a Run-off Lines segment for products that we no longer underwrite.\nWe consider many factors, including the nature of each segment's insurance and reinsurance products, production sources, distribution strategies and regulatory environment, in determining how to aggregate reporting segments.\nIn evaluating the operating performance of our segments, we focus on core underwriting and investing results before consideration of realized gains or losses from the sales of investments. Intersegment transactions are allocated to the segment that initiated the transaction. Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment, as decisions regarding the acquisition and disposal of securities reside with the corporate investment function and are not under the control of the individual business segments. Although this measure of profit (loss) does not replace net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability, management uses this measure of profit (loss) to focus our reporting segments on generating operating income.\nSince we generally manage and monitor the investment portfolio on an aggregate basis, the overall performance of the investment portfolio, and related net investment income, is discussed above on a combined basis under consolidated net investment income rather than within or by segment.\nExcess and Surplus Lines.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Excess and Surplus Lines segment:\n\nThe increase in gross written and earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in the casualty and environmental units, partially offset by reduced premiums in the property, contract and allied medical units. Premiums for the property, contract and allied medical units continued to decline due to increased competition and low rates. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment continues to be impacted by increased competition and pressure on rates.\nThe increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with increased catastrophe losses.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11.6 million in catastrophe losses consisting of $5.5 million from various storm activity in the United States, $4.2 million from the Louisiana floods and $1.9 million from Hurricane Matthew. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $13.2 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $8.2 million of favorable development in our commercial automobile lines and $4.0 million of favorable development in our property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.5 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting these current accident year losses was $25.5 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $23.5 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines and $5.2 million in our commercial automobile lines. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $3.6 million of unfavorable development in the property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.3 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting the catastrophe losses was $38.9 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $54.7 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines of business. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $12.5 million of unfavorable development in commercial automobile lines and $3.3 million in the property lines.\nThe decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to reduced acquisition expenses due to increased ceding commissions coupled with reduced contingent commissions. Partially offsetting the reduced acquisition expenses were increased non-acquisition expenses due to increased information technology, depreciation and outside services expenses partially offset by an increase of claims related expenses transferred to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commission coupled with reduced outside services costs. Partially offsetting these reductions was increased compensation and information technology costs.\nCommercial Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Commercial Specialty segment:\n\nThe increase in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in our public entity, professional liability and surety units. Partially offsetting these increases was reduced underwriting in our grocery and retail business units due to planned reductions as we exited unprofitable accounts and implemented underwriting initiatives. Additionally, gross written premiums increased $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased premium writings in our fronting programs. The fronting programs do not impact earned premiums, but result in ceding commissions received. The increase in earned premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in gross written premiums coupled with a reduction in ceding percentages for certain lines of business.\nThe decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with reduced catastrophe losses. The decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to improved current accident year results.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.6 million in catastrophe losses, including $2.1 million for storm activity in the United States and $0.5 million for Hurricane Matthew. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $22.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $9.0 million favorable development in the workers compensation lines, $7.0 million in the surety lines, $6.2 million in automobile liability lines and $2.0 million in the property lines. Partially offsetting this favorable development was $1.5 million of unfavorable development in the other liability lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.2 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $2.5 million in net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $11.9 million of unfavorable development in general liability and $8.7 million of unfavorable development in the workers compensation lines due to increases in claim severity. Partially offsetting this unfavorable development was $8.8 million of favorable development in short-tail lines, $6.6 million favorable development in errors and ommissions lines and $2.1 million of favorable development on an assumed directors and officers program.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $1.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $19.5 million of unfavorable development in general liability due to increases in claim severity, offset by favorable development of $8.5 million in errors and ommissions lines, $7.9 million in short-tail lines and $5.8 million in workers compensation.\nThe increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million favorable adjustment to the premium taxes and assessments accrual recorded in 2015. Partially offsetting the increased premium taxes and assessments was increased fronting fees received and an increase of claims related\nexpenses reclassified to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to the favorable change in estimate of the premium taxes and assessments accrual.\nFee and other income increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 due to the recognition of a $1.7 million gain on the sale of certain business units. The decline in fee and other expenses was primarily attributable to certain programs that were previously non-risk bearing converting to risk bearing programs.\nAs a result of our annual evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets, we determined that the goodwill and intangible asset which resulted from a 2010 acquisition were impaired and therefore, we wrote-off $3.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInternational Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the International Specialty segment:\n\nThe decline in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in our property reinsurance unit due to increased competition, changes in terms and conditions and declining rates. Partially offsetting this decline was increased gross written premiums in our casualty and professional liability units which was the result of new business submissions partially offset by declining rates and increased competition. Gross written premiums for our Brazilian unit was favorably impacted by currency gains, as the Brazilian Real strengthened against the U.S Dollar. The increase in earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a reduction in our ceding percentages, coupled", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors described in this report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $146.7 million, or $4.75 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net income of $163.2 million, or $5.20 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported net income of $183.2 million, or $5.70 per fully diluted share.\nThe following is a comparison of select data from our results of operations:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,164.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,012.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,905.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,410.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,371.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,338.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment and other gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,576.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,506.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,539.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 181.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended in 2015 and 2014 was primarily the result of increased premiums in all segments with the exception of International Specialty as our property reinsurance book was adversely impacted by increased competition and declining rates. All segments were impacted to some degree by increasing competition and, in some cases, declining rates, with our International Specialty and Syndicate 1200 segments being the most impacted by this competition. Net written premiums increased within our Excess and Surplus Lines and Commercial Specialty segments due to the increases in gross written premiums and increased risk retention. Net written premiums for our International Specialty segment declined in 2016 due to the reduction in gross written premiums, partially offset by increased risk retention. Net written premiums for the Syndicate 1200 segment declined in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 due to reductions in our participation percentages, partially offset by increased risk retention. The increase in consolidated earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 was due to the increase in gross and net written premiums.\nThe increase in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $20.9 million increase in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.9 million for the same period ended 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we evaluated our accounting for income from our alternative investment portfolio and determined that as we manage these investments to appreciate in value on a quarter to quarter basis, it is more appropriate to classify the change in value as net investment income as opposed to realized investment gains (losses). All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income increased $5.6 million from $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $91.2 million for the same period ended 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in income on our fixed maturity portfolio, partially offset by increased investment related expenses. The decline in consolidated net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to a $16.5 million decrease in the return on our alternative investment portfolio, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.0 million for the same period ended 2015. Absent the results of the alternative investments, consolidated net investment income was comparable at $85.6 million and $86.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total invested assets at December 31, 2016 were $4,192.4 million, net of $131.9 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2015 were $4,020.4 million, net of $95.3 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers. Total invested assets at December 31, 2014 were $4,022.7 million, net of $75.2 million of invested assets attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers.\nConsolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $62.0 million in realized gains primarily from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $25.7 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $10.2 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $38.9 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities. Partially offsetting these realized gains was $3.1 million of realized foreign currency exchange losses, primarily from our fixed maturity portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an $11.9 million other-than-temporary impairment loss within our equity and fixed maturity portfolios. Consolidated net realized investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $34.3 million in realized gains from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities and a $43.3 million gain from the sale of an investment property. Partially offsetting these realized gains was a\n$2.3 million realized loss from the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments within our equity and fixed maturity portfolio. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our investment portfolio was negligible for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nConsolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses were $810.1 million, $766.1 million and $747.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the consolidated loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was attributable to increased catastrophe losses. The consolidated loss ratios were comparable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily due to improved current accident year losses in 2015, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses and reduced net favorable reserve development on prior accident years.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2016 were $63.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, including Hurricane Matthew and the Louisiana floods, the Alberta wildfires and the Taiwan and New Zealand earthquakes. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $33.3 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, which is presented in the table below.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2015 were $24.9 million in catastrophe losses resulting from United States and other storm activity, and the Tianjin explosion. Partially offsetting these current accident year losses was $32.4 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line, our Syndicate 1200 liability lines and our commercial automobile lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in our workers compensation and commercial multi-peril lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2014 was $18.7 million in catastrophe losses resulting from storm activity in the United States, various hailstorms, Typhoon Rammasum and Hurricane Odile. Partially offsetting these 2014 accident year losses was $37.7 million of net favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves, primarily attributable to favorable development in our general liability line and our Syndicate 1200 liability and property lines, partially offset by unfavorable development in the commercial multi-peril and commercial automobile lines.\nThe following table summarizes the above referenced loss reserve development as respects prior year loss reserves by line of business for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Reserve\nDevelopment\n(Favorable)/\nUnfavorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\n2015 Net\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 948.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 322.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 163.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicate 1200 property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinsurance - nonproportional assumed property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fidelity/Surety\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 182.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,133.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining appropriate reserve levels for the year ended December 31, 2016, we maintained the same general processes and disciplines that were used to set reserves at prior reporting dates. No significant changes in methodologies were made to estimate the reserves since the last reporting date; however, at each reporting date we reassess the actuarial estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses and record our best estimate. Consistent with prior reserve valuations, as claims data becomes more mature for prior accident years, actuarial estimates were refined to weigh certain actuarial methods more heavily in order to respond to any emerging trends in the paid and reported loss data. While prior accident years' net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for some lines of business have developed favorably in recent years, this does not imply that more recent accident years' reserves also will develop favorably; pricing, reinsurance costs, legal environment, general economic conditions including changes in inflation and many other factors impact our ultimate loss estimates.\nConsolidated gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were $3,350.8 million (including $156.1 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), $3,123.6 million (including $102.3 million of reserves attributable to Syndicate 1200's trade capital providers), and $3,042.4 million (including $80.3 million of reserves attributable to the trade capital providers) as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management has recorded its best estimate of loss reserves at each\ndate based on current known facts and circumstances. Due to the significant uncertainties inherent in the estimation of loss reserves, there can be no assurance that future loss development, favorable or unfavorable, will not occur.\nConsolidated underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses were $547.0 million, $536.7 million and $537.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in the expense ratio for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commissions received, reduced contingent commissions payable and lower equity stock compensation expenses, partially offset by increased premium taxes and assessment expenses. The decline in the consolidated expense ratio for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to lower acquisition cost primarily attributable to lower premium taxes, fees and assessments coupled with increased ceding commissions received. Non-acquisition cost increased due to higher compensation and information technology costs, partially offset by lower outside services expense.\nConsolidated interest expense was $19.6 million, $19.0 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in consolidated interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of slightly higher interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments. The decline in consolidated interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was the result of slightly reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments.\nConsolidated foreign currency exchange gains were $4.5 million $18.3 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The changes in the foreign currency exchange gains were due to fluctuations of the U.S Dollar, on a weighted average basis, against the currencies in which we transact our business.\nThe consolidated provisions for income taxes were $35.2 million, $14.3 million and $32.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The consolidated income tax provision represents the income tax expense associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, the consolidated provision for income taxes represents taxes on net income for our United States, Ireland, Belgium, Brazil, Switzerland and United Kingdom operations. The consolidated effective tax rates were 19.4%, 8.1% and 15.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax income in the United States. Pretax income for our United States operations increased to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $64.8 million for the same period ended 2015. The decline in the consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced taxable pretax income in the United States while permanent tax differences remained consistent. Pretax income was higher in 2014, due to the recognition in 2014 of a $43.3 million realized gain from the sale of property. Additionally, our United Kingdom operations reported a tax benefit for 2015, primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.\nSegment Results\nWe are primarily engaged in writing property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. We have four ongoing reporting segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200. Additionally, we have a Run-off Lines segment for products that we no longer underwrite.\nWe consider many factors, including the nature of each segment's insurance and reinsurance products, production sources, distribution strategies and regulatory environment, in determining how to aggregate reporting segments.\nIn evaluating the operating performance of our segments, we focus on core underwriting and investing results before consideration of realized gains or losses from the sales of investments. Intersegment transactions are allocated to the segment that initiated the transaction. Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment, as decisions regarding the acquisition and disposal of securities reside with the corporate investment function and are not under the control of the individual business segments. Although this measure of profit (loss) does not replace net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability, management uses this measure of profit (loss) to focus our reporting segments on generating operating income.\nSince we generally manage and monitor the investment portfolio on an aggregate basis, the overall performance of the investment portfolio, and related net investment income, is discussed above on a combined basis under consolidated net investment income rather than within or by segment.\nExcess and Surplus Lines.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Excess and Surplus Lines segment:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 562.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 530.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 485.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 471.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 286.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 144.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,112.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,094.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,075.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross written and earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in the casualty and environmental units, partially offset by reduced premiums in the property, contract and allied medical units. Premiums for the property, contract and allied medical units continued to decline due to increased competition and low rates. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment continues to be impacted by increased competition and pressure on rates.\nThe increase in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to reduced net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with increased catastrophe losses.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11.6 million in catastrophe losses consisting of $5.5 million from various storm activity in the United States, $4.2 million from the Louisiana floods and $1.9 million from Hurricane Matthew. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $13.2 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily attributable to $8.2 million of favorable development in our commercial automobile lines and $4.0 million of favorable development in our property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.5 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting these current accident year losses was $25.5 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $23.5 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines and $5.2 million in our commercial automobile lines. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $3.6 million of unfavorable development in the property lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.3 million in catastrophe losses from storm activity in the United States. Offsetting the catastrophe losses was $38.9 million of net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years primarily due to $54.7 million of favorable development in the general and products liability lines of business. Partially offsetting this net favorable development was $12.5 million of unfavorable development in commercial automobile lines and $3.3 million in the property lines.\nThe decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to reduced acquisition expenses due to increased ceding commissions coupled with reduced contingent commissions. Partially offsetting the reduced acquisition expenses were increased non-acquisition expenses due to increased information technology, depreciation and outside services expenses partially offset by an increase of claims related expenses transferred to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to increased ceding commission coupled with reduced outside services costs. Partially offsetting these reductions was increased compensation and information technology costs.\nCommercial Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Commercial Specialty segment:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 691.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 582.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 517.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 364.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 344.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 332.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee and other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 915.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 794.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 742.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods ended 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to growth in our public entity, professional liability and surety units. Partially offsetting these increases was reduced underwriting in our grocery and retail business units due to planned reductions as we exited unprofitable accounts and implemented underwriting initiatives. Additionally, gross written premiums increased $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased premium writings in our fronting programs. The fronting programs do not impact earned premiums, but result in ceding commissions received. The increase in earned premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in gross written premiums coupled with a reduction in ceding percentages for certain lines of business.\nThe decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years coupled with reduced catastrophe losses. The decline in the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily attributable to improved current accident year results.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.6 million in catastrophe losses, including $2.1 million for storm activity in the United States and $0.5 million for Hurricane Matthew. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $22.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $9.0 million favorable development in the workers compensation lines, $7.0 million in the surety lines, $6.2 million in automobile liability lines and $2.0 million in the property lines. Partially offsetting this favorable development was $1.5 million of unfavorable development in the other liability lines.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.2 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $2.5 million in net unfavorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $11.9 million of unfavorable development in general liability and $8.7 million of unfavorable development in the workers compensation lines due to increases in claim severity. Partially offsetting this unfavorable development was $8.8 million of favorable development in short-tail lines, $6.6 million favorable development in errors and ommissions lines and $2.1 million of favorable development on an assumed directors and officers program.\nIncluded in losses and loss adjustment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 million in catastrophe losses for storm activity in the United States. Included in losses and loss adjustment expenses was $1.7 million in net favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years, primarily attributable to $19.5 million of unfavorable development in general liability due to increases in claim severity, offset by favorable development of $8.5 million in errors and ommissions lines, $7.9 million in short-tail lines and $5.8 million in workers compensation.\nThe increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million favorable adjustment to the premium taxes and assessments accrual recorded in 2015. Partially offsetting the increased premium taxes and assessments was increased fronting fees received and an increase of claims related\nexpenses reclassified to unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The decline in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period ended 2014 was primarily attributable to the favorable change in estimate of the premium taxes and assessments accrual.\nFee and other income increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period ended 2015 due to the recognition of a $1.7 million gain on the sale of certain business units. The decline in fee and other expenses was primarily attributable to certain programs that were previously non-risk bearing converting to risk bearing programs.\nAs a result of our annual evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets, we determined that the goodwill and intangible asset which resulted from a 2010 acquisition were impaired and therefore, we wrote-off $3.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInternational Specialty\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the International Specialty segment:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 266.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 279.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned premiums\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss reserves at December 31\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 374.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 313.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in our property reinsurance unit due to increased competition, changes in terms and conditions and declining rates. Partially offsetting this decline was increased gross written premiums in our casualty and professional liability units which was the result of new business submissions partially offset by declining rates and increased competition. Gross written premiums for our Brazilian unit was favorably impacted by currency gains, as the Brazilian Real strengthened against the U.S Dollar. The increase in earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to a reduction in our ceding percentages, coupled"}
