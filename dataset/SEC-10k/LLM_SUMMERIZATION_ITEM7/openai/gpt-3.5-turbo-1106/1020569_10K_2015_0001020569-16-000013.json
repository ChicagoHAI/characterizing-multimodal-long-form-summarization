Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThis discussion contains \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other securities laws. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page iii of this Annual Report and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" beginning on page 12 of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nProposed Recall Acquisition\nOn June 8, 2015, we entered into the Recall Agreement with Recall to acquire Recall by way of the Scheme. Under the terms of the Recall Agreement, Recall shareholders are entitled to receive the Cash Supplement as well as either (1) 0.1722 shares of our common stock for each Recall share or (2) the Cash Election. The Cash Election is subject to the Cash Election Cap. Amounts paid to Recall shareholders that represent the Cash Supplement are excluded from the calculation of the Cash Election Cap. Assuming a sufficient number of Recall shareholders elect the Cash Election such that we pay the Cash Election Cap, we expect to issue approximately 50.7 million shares of our common stock and, based on the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of February 19, 2016, pay approximately US$323.0 million to Recall shareholders in connection with the Recall Transaction which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of February 19, 2016, would result in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately $1,791.0 million. Completion of the Scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, including among others, (i) approval by Recall shareholders of the Scheme by the requisite majority under the Australian Corporations Act, (ii) expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period and receipt of regulatory consents, approvals and clearances, in each case, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under relevant antitrust/competition and foreign investment legislation in other relevant jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any final, non-appealable order, decree or law preventing, making illegal or prohibiting the completion of the Recall Transaction, (iv) approval from the NYSE to the listing of additional shares of our common stock to be issued in the Recall Transaction, (v) the establishment of a secondary listing on the ASX to allow Recall shareholders to trade our common stock via CHESS Depository Interests on the ASX, (vi) Recall's delivery of tax opinions in accordance and in compliance with certain tax matter agreements to which Recall is a party and (vii) no events having occurred that would have a material adverse effect on Recall or us. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall Transaction and related integration planning.\nWe currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of approximately $80.0 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and approximately $300.0 million of Recall Integration Costs. Of these amounts, approximately $47.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2015 ($24.7 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and $22.4 million of Recall Integration Costs), including approximately $47.0 million of operating expenditures and approximately $0.1 million of capital expenditures.\nDivestitures\nIn December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (the \"International Shredding Operations\") in a stock transaction for approximately $26.2 million of cash at closing. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. We have concluded that this divestiture did not meet the requirements to be presented as a discontinued operation and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of approximately $6.9 million ($10.2 million, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from our International Shredding Operations in 2014 represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. The International Shredding Operations in Australia were previously included in the Other International Business segment and the International Shredding Operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom were previously included in the Western European Business segment.\nCost Optimization Plans\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs (the Organizational Restructuring\u201d), which was completed in 2014. As a result of the Organizational Restructuring, we recorded charges of $23.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Records and Information Management Business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Data Management Business\n</td> <td>2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western European Business\n</td> <td>2,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other International Business\n</td> <td>1,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other Business\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to reduce our overhead costs, particularly in our developed markets, in order to optimize our selling, general and administrative cost structure and to support investments to advance our growth strategy (the Transformation Initiative\u201d), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As a result of the Transformation Initiative, we recorded charges of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Records and Information Management Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Data Management Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western European Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other International Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we implemented additional actions associated with our Transformation Initiative. As a result of these actions, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7.0 million, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits, and included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Of this charge, approximately $4.4 million, $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $1.8 million was associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Corporate and Other Business segments, respectively.\nAs we quantify incremental costs associated with future Transformation Initiative actions to achieve our $125.0 million cost reduction goal, we will disclose the relevant cost estimates and charges in the period that such actions are approved.\nGeneral\nAs a result of a realignment in our senior management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2015, we modified our internal financial reporting to better align internal reporting with how we manage our business. These modifications resulted in the separation of our former International Business segment into two unique reportable operating segments, which we refer to as (1) Western European Business segment and (2) Other International Business segment. Also, during the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed the nature of certain costs which were previously being allocated to the North American Records and Information Management Business and North American Data Management Business segments. As a result of this reassessment, we determined that certain product management functions, which were previously being performed to solely benefit our North American operating segments, are now being performed in a manner that benefits the enterprise as a whole. Accordingly, the costs associated with these product management functions are now included within the Corporate and Other Business segment. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment.\nAs a result of these changes noted above, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nOur revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code (\"Intellectual Property Management\"). Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent removal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) the storage, assembly and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders (\"Fulfillment Services\"); (9) consulting services; and (10) other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. While customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.\nCost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.\nThe expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international operations are more labor intensive than our operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international segment revenue. In addition, the overhead structure of our\nexpanding international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our North American segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates and the 2014 results at the 2015 average exchange rates.\nThe following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our United States dollar-reported revenues and expenses:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Exchange\nRates for the\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nStrengthening /\n(Weakening) of\nForeign Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>British pound sterling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Exchange\nRates for the\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nStrengthening /\n(Weakening) of\nForeign Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>British pound sterling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, Recall Costs (as defined below) and REIT Costs (as defined below). Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs (as defined below); (5) REIT Costs (as defined below); (6) other expense (income), net; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues.

FFO (NAREIT) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (NAREIT) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (NAREIT) is net income. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to FFO (NAREIT) are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (NAREIT) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) Recall Costs; (4) REIT Costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) deferred income taxes and REIT tax adjustments; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO (NAREIT) and FFO (Normalized) (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Real Estate Depreciation(1)\n</td> <td>184,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax\n</td> <td>(8,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (NAREIT)\n</td> <td>504,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Loss on Disposal/Write-Down of Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Real Estate), Net\n</td> <td>1,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recall Costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT Costs\n</td> <td>22,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Expense, Net(2)\n</td> <td>65,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred Income Taxes and REIT Tax Adjustments(3)\n</td> <td>(144,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (Normalized)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes depreciation expense related to real estate assets (land improvements, buildings, building improvements and racking).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net of $58.3 million and $70.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>REIT tax adjustments primarily include the impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings and accounting method changes related to our REIT conversion (including the impact of amended tax returns).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nPart of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nEach acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition, as we acquire additional information impacting our estimates as of the acquisition date. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions.\nDetermining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOf the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of fair value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined internally. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.\nOf the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in our most significant acquisition in fiscal year 2015 (Crozier), a hypothetical increase of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows attributable to this acquisition, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the calculated fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets for this acquisition by $1.6 million (or 10.0%), with an offsetting decrease to goodwill. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible asset for this acquisition by $0.8 million (or 5.1%), with an offsetting decrease to goodwill.\nOur estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions.\nImpairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets\nAssets subject to depreciation or amortization: We review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If events indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, the long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nGoodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized.\nWe have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment analysis date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of those dates. Our reporting units, at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2015, were as follows: (1) North American Records and Information Management (which includes Intellectual Property Management and Fulfillment Services); (2) North American Secure Shredding; (3) North American Data Management; (4) Adjacent Businesses - Data Centers (which consists primarily of our data center business in the United States); (5) Adjacent Businesses - Consumer Storage (which consists of a consumer storage business with operations in the United States acquired in April 2015); (6) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway (the UKI and Norway\u201d reporting unit); (7) Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland (the Continental Western Europe\u201d reporting unit); (8) the remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Denmark (the Emerging Markets - Eastern Europe\u201d reporting unit); (9) Latin America; (10) Australia and Singapore; (11) China and Hong Kong (the Greater China\u201d reporting unit); (12) India; and (13) Russia, Ukraine and Denmark. See Note 2.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report for a description of our reporting units.\nBased on our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2015, all of our reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 25%. As of December 31, 2015, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2015 goodwill impairment analysis. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.\nReporting unit valuations have been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market multiples of revenues and/or earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. Of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. We have assessed the sensitivity of these assumptions on each of our reporting units as of October 1, 2015. With respect to all of our reporting units as of October 1, 2015, we noted that, based on the fair value of these reporting units determined as of October 1, 2015, (i) a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows of these reporting units, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of these reporting units as of October 1, 2015 by a range of approximately 8.3% to 10.5% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value; and (ii) a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of these reporting units as of October 1, 2015 by a range of approximately 5.1% to 21.8% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a REIT, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. The income of our domestic TRSs, which hold our domestic operations that may not be REIT-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. In addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal tax purposes or TRSs. We will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a five-year period following the REIT conversion that are attributable to \"built-in\" gains with respect to the assets that we owned on January 1, 2014. This built-in gains tax has been imposed on our depreciation recapture recognized into income as a result of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. As a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRS operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some do not follow them at all.\nAccounting for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change is enacted. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not standard as defined in GAAP. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the recoverability of the asset.\nWe have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $70.8 million at December 31, 2015 to reduce future federal taxable income, on which $3.0 million of federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We can carry forward these net operating losses to the extent we do not utilize them in any given available year. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2016 through 2034, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $66.2 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 91%. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we had approximately $56.0 million and $47.7 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.\nWe had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because our intent, prior to our conversion to a REIT, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of our conversion to a REIT, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States, and, therefore, during 2014, we recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46.4 million, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such foreign earnings. We continue to provide incremental federal and state income taxes on net book over outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As a REIT, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding taxes in limited instances; however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with REIT distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2.w. in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nResults of

In the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated storage rental internal growth and the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures were offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 5.2%, compared to the same prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 2.7% in the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures of 1.3% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our consolidated storage rental revenue growth in 2015 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.1%, 4.2%, 2.7% and 10.8% in our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Other International Business segments, respectively. Global records management net volumes at December 31, 2015 increased by 2.3% over the ending volume at December 31, 2014, supported by 6.1% volume increases in our Other International Business segment. Consolidated storage rental revenues increased $75.5 million, or 4.2%, to $1,860.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1,784.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The reported revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 consists primarily of revenue internal growth of 2.2%. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.2% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2014 over 2013. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately 1.2%. Our consolidated storage rental revenue internal growth in 2014 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.3%, 2.3%, 1.9% and 11.6% in our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Other International Business segments, respectively.\nConsolidated service revenues decreased $87.4 million, or 6.9%, to $1,170.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1,257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Service revenue internal growth was negative 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same prior year period. The negative service revenue internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. In the North American Records and Information Management Business segment, the decline in service activities has begun to stabilize in recent periods, while service revenue declines in the North American Data Management Business segment are reflecting more recent reductions in service activity levels. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported total service revenues by 6.0% in 2015 over 2014. Net acquisitions/divestitures decreased reported service revenues by 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $23.7 million reduction in consolidated service revenue associated with the disposition of our International Shredding Operations. Consolidated service revenues increased $17.5 million, or 1.4%, to $1,257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1,239.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2014, the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures was offset by negative service revenue internal growth and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.5% of the increase in reported service revenues in 2014. Service revenue internal growth was negative 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The negative service revenue internal growth for 2014 reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased reported service revenues by 1.4% in 2014 over 2013.\nFor the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues decreased $109.7 million, or 3.5%, to $3,008.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3,117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 5.6%, compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the Euro against the United States dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. This decrease was partially offset by consolidated revenue internal growth of 1.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures of 0.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our consolidated revenues increased $93.1 million, or 3.1%, to $3,117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $3,024.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Revenue internal growth was 1.0% for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar, partially offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the United States dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods.

During the past eight quarters our storage rental revenue internal growth rate has ranged between 1.4% and 3.5%. Storage rental revenue internal growth rates have been relatively stable over the past two fiscal years, averaging between 2.2% and 2.7% for full-year 2014 and 2015. At various points in the economic cycle, storage rental revenue internal growth may be influenced by changes in pricing and volume. In 2014, we initiated sales force programs focused on increasing volume through new sales and improved customer retention. In addition, we continue to enhance our pricing strategy through implementing a statistical-based approach, which enables customized pricing based on customer profiles and needs. Within our international portfolio, the Western European Business segment is generating consistent low-to-mid single-digit storage rental revenue internal growth, while the Other International Business segment is producing strong double-digit storage rental revenue internal growth by capturing the first-time outsourcing trends for physical records storage and management in those markets. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage rental revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of pricing for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. The internal growth rate for total service revenues reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as continued service declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of Sales\nConsolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists of the following expenses (in thousands):\nTable 126:

Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and consisted of $1.7 million of asset write-offs in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, approximately $0.3 million of asset write-offs in our Corporate and Other Business segment, approximately $0.6 million of asset write-offs associated with our Western European Business segment and approximately $0.3 million of asset write-offs associated with our Other International Business segment, partially offset by gains of approximately $2.5 million on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets primarily associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment.\nOPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA (in thousands)\nThe following table reflects the effect of the foregoing factors on our consolidated operating income and Adjusted OIBDA:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>925,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>920,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA Margin\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>894,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>925,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA Margin\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOTHER EXPENSES, NET\nInterest Expense, Net\nConsolidated interest expense, net increased $3.2 million to $263.9 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $260.7 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to (1) the issuance in September 2014 of 400.0 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of the 61/8% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"GBP Notes\") by Iron Mountain Europe PLC (\"IME\"), (2) the issuance in September 2015 of $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"6% Notes due 2020\") by IMI and (3) higher borrowings (on a weighted average basis) under the Credit Agreement, the Former Credit Agreement and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program (each as discussed and defined below) during 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was partially offset by (1) the redemption in December 2014 of $306.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the \"83/8% Notes\") and (2) the redemption in October 2015 of (i) 255.0 million Euro in aggregate principal outstanding of the 6 3/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the \"6 3/4% Notes\"), (ii) $400.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of the 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the \"7 3/4% Notes) and (iii) the remaining $106.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of the 8 3/8% Notes.

These losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Euro, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2014, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries, as well as Euro forward contracts. These losses were partially offset by gains primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling as it relates to our intercompany balances with and between our European subsidiaries and Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI.\nWe recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $58.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, based on period-end exchange rates. These losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Euro, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2013, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries, as well as Euro forward contracts. These losses were partially offset by gains primarily from British pound sterling borrowings on our revolving credit facility, Australian dollar and British pound sterling forward contracts, and Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI.\nWe recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $36.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, based on period-end exchange rates. These losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Euro against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2012, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European, Australian and Brazilian subsidiaries as well as British pound sterling debt and forward currency contracts, which were partially offset by gains as a result of an Australian forward currency contract, as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2012 as it relates to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $27.3 million related to (i) the refinancing of the Credit Agreement in the third quarter of 2015 and (ii) the early extinguishment of the 63/4% Notes, 73/4% Notes and the remaining portion outstanding of the 83/8% Notes in the fourth quarter of 2015. This charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $16.5 million related to the early redemption of $306.0 million in aggregate principal of the 83/8% Notes at 104.188% of par. This charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $43.7 million related to (i) the amendment of our Former Credit Agreement (as defined below) in the third quarter of 2013, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs, and (ii) the early extinguishment of the 71/2% Notes, the 8% Notes due 2018, the 8% Notes due 2020 and a portion of the 83/8% Notes. This charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs.\nOther, net in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $0.6 million related to the write-down of certain investments. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2014 included income of $9.6 million. In December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom in a stock transaction and recorded a pretax gain of approximately $6.9 million (see Note 16 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Also included in other, net in the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $0.9 million of royalty income and $1.1 million of gains associated with a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2013 consists primarily of $3.7 million of royalty income.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 38.9%, (43.5)% and 23.3%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 were the impact from the repatriation discussed below, which increased our 2013 effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). These expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact provided by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates.\nDuring 2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252.7 million (approximately $65.2 million of which was previously subject to United States taxes) from our foreign earnings. Due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a full benefit for such foreign tax credit carryforwards in our tax provision. As a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $63.5 million in 2013. This increase was offset by decreases of $18.8 million from current year foreign tax credits and $23.3 million reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of $21.5 million in our tax provision from continuing operations.\nAs a result of our REIT conversion, we recorded a net tax benefit of $212.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 for the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the REIT conversion. In 2014, we recorded an increase to the tax provision of $29.3 million associated with tax accounting method changes consistent with our REIT conversion, primarily affected through the filing of amended tax returns. The other primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2014 was an increase of $46.4 million in our tax provision associated with incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries no longer considered permanently invested and other net tax adjustments related to the REIT conversion, including a tax benefit of $63.3 million primarily related to the dividends paid deduction.\nThe primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction of $51.6 million and an out-of-period tax adjustment (approximately $9.0 million tax benefit) recorded during the third quarter to correct the valuation of certain deferred tax assets associated with the REIT conversion that occurred in 2014, partially offset by valuation allowances on certain of our foreign net operating losses of $33.5 million, primarily related to our foreign subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, France and Russia.\nAs a REIT, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense. As a REIT, substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic TRSs.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified REIT subsidiaries and our TRSs, as well as between the jurisdictions in which we operate; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize net operating losses that we generate. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax\nConsolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.9 million, net of tax of $0.2 million associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million, net of tax of $2.2 million associated with the sale of two buildings in the United Kingdom and a building in Canada. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.4 million, net of tax of $0.4 million associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom.\nINCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (in thousands)\nThe following table reflects the effect of the foregoing factors on our consolidated income from continuing operations:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(203,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from Continuing Operations as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from Continuing Operations as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to legal reserves, offset by the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which primarily represents the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $2.0 million, $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners' share of earnings/losses in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results.\nSegment Analysis (in thousands)\nAs a result of a realignment in our senior management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2015, we modified our internal financial reporting to better align internal reporting with how we manage our business. These modifications resulted in the separation of our former International Business segment into two unique reportable operating segments, which we refer to as (1) Western European Business segment and (2) Other International Business segment. Also, during the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed the nature of certain costs which were previously being allocated to the North American Records and Information Management Business and North American Data Management Business segments. As a result of this reassessment, we determined that certain product management functions, which were previously being performed to solely benefit our North American operating segments, are now being performed in a manner that benefits the enterprise as a whole. Accordingly, the costs associated with these product management functions are now included within the Corporate and Other Business segment. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment.\nAs a result of these changes noted above, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nOur five reportable operating segments are described as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North American Records and Information Management Business-storage and information management services, including Records Management, Destruction and DMS throughout the United States and Canada; as well as Fulfillment Services and Intellectual Property Management in the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North American Data Management Business-Data Protection & Recovery; server and computer backup services; digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients, throughout the United States and Canada.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Western European Business-storage and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout the United Kingdom, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.

These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Our Corporate and Other Business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and

North American Records and Information Management Business segment decreased 1.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to negative internal growth and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Records and Information Management Business segment by 1.5% compared to the same prior year period due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Negative internal growth of 0.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of negative service revenue internal growth of 1.6% in the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting from reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues. Net acquisitions/divestitures increased reported revenue in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment by 1.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 140 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by a $11.7 million decrease in professional fees, a $7.5 million decrease in fuel and insurance costs, a $5.7 million decrease in incentive compensation and a $1.6 million decrease in costs due to the Organizational Restructuring, as well as a decrease in sales, marketing and account management costs. These decreases were partially offset by $5.4 million of employee severance costs recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the Transformation Initiative.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenue in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment increased 1.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of 2.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Flat total internal growth was primarily the result of negative service internal growth of 0.5%, resulting from a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 0.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to net price increases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Records and Information Management Business segment by 0.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 200 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to decreases in restructuring charges and compensation expense as a result of the organizational restructuring initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nNorth American Data Management Business\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

The internal growth was primarily attributable to storage rental revenue internal growth of 4.2%, partially offset by negative service revenue internal growth of 5.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015, which was due to declines in service revenue activity levels as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Data Management Business segment by 0.9% compared to the prior year due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased 580 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased overhead expenses of $15.9 million, primarily associated with higher sales, marketing and account management expenses and, to a lesser extent, reduced gross profit related to a decline in service revenues without a corresponding decrease in costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenue in our North American Data Management Business segment decreased 1.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to negative internal growth of 1.5%.

Western European Business segment decreased 11.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations resulted in decreased revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 10.4% as compared to the same prior year period, due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the United States dollar. Revenue internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 1.4%, supported by 2.7% storage rental revenue internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net acquisitions/divestitures decreased reported revenue in our Western European Business segment by 2.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $15.3 million reduction in reported service revenues associated with the disposition of our shredding operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland in December 2014. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 140 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to improved profitability associated with lower transportation and facility costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenues in our Western European Business segment increased 3.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 was negative 0.6%, driven by negative 4.0% service revenue internal growth, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 1.9%. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 resulted in increased revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 3.4% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the United States dollar.

reported revenues in our Other International Business segment decreased 10.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations in the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in decreased revenue, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 21.7% as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Euro against the United States dollar. Revenue internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 10.0% supported by 10.8% storage rental revenue internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net acquisitions/divestitures increased reported revenue in our Other International Business segment by 1.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as the impact of our recent acquisitions in Brazil, Turkey and Poland were partially offset by a $8.4 million decrease in reported service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the disposition of our Australian shredding operations in December 2014. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 270 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily a result of a constant dollar increase in gross profit of 11.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same prior year period. The constant dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenues in our Other International Business segment increased 14.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 10.7%, supported by 11.6% storage rental internal growth and 9.4% total service revenue internal growth. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 14.3% of the increase in total reported revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2014. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 resulted in decreased revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 10.6% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar and Brazilian real against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased by 330 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the impact associated with a fire at one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina in February 2014, as well as integration costs associated with recent international acquisitions.\nCorporate and Other Business Table

Adjusted OIBDA for the Corporate and Other Business segment increased by $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with a fire at one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina in February 2014, as well as a decrease in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to professional fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted OIBDA in the Corporate and Other Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased by 20 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with the fire at one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina noted above, higher professional fees of $2.6 million, restructuring costs of $1.5 million and REIT compliance costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, Table 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities-continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>472,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>541,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from investing activities-continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(632,750\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(479,978\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(422,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from financing activities-continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108,511\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $541.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $472.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 14.5% year-over-year increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income (including non-cash charges and realized foreign exchange losses) of $79.2 million, partially offset by an increase in cash used in working capital of $10.4 million primarily related to the payments and timing of certain accrued expenses and deferred revenue liabilities.\nOur business requires capital expenditures to maintain our ongoing operations, support our expected revenue growth and new products and services, and increase our profitability. These expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. Our capital goes to support business-line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired), acquisition of customer relationships and Customer Inducements during the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $290.2 million, $113.6 million, $32.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, these expenditures were primarily funded with cash flows from operations. Excluding capital expenditures associated with potential future acquisitions and opportunistic real estate investments, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $300.0 million to $330.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2016. We expect to spend up to $100.0 million of additional capital expenditures on opportunistic real estate investments in the year ending December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received net proceeds of $985.0 million associated with the issuance of the 6% Notes due 2020 in September 2015, $128.8 million associated with our revolving credit and term loan facilities (including the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program) and $7.1 million from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these transactions, as well as cash flows provided by operating activities, for the redemption of the 63/4% Notes, the 73/4% Notes and the 83/8% Notes for approximately $814.7 million (inclusive of call premiums) and payment of dividends in the amount of $406.5 million on our common stock.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table presents our capital spend for 2013, 2014 and 2015 organized by the type of the spending as described in the \"Our Business Fundamentals\" section of \"Item 1.

The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2015 related to cash and cash equivalents held in time deposits with four global banks, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $128.4 million, which included time deposits amounting to $18.6 million.\nOur consolidated debt as of December 31, 2015 comprised the following (in thousands):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Debt (inclusive of discount and premium)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unamortized Deferred Financing Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan(1)\n</td> <td>243,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6% Notes due 2020(2)(3)\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>983,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAD Notes(4)\n</td> <td>144,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBP Notes(3)(5)\n</td> <td>592,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>583,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6% Notes due 2023(2)\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>53/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (2)\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,902\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>988,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other(6)\n</td> <td>333,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,070\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts Receivable Securitization Program(7)\n</td> <td>205,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>4,903,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,845,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less Current Portion\n</td> <td>(88,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt, Net of Current Portion\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,815,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,757,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our United States subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our United States subsidiary guarantors.

The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and a term loan (the \"Term Loan\").\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of 25 banks and enables IMI and certain of its United States and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1,500.0 million. The Term Loan is to be paid in quarterly installments in an amount equal to $3.1 million per quarter, with the remaining balance due on July 3, 2019. The Credit Agreement includes an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement terminates on July 6, 2019, at which point all obligations become due, but may be extended by one year at our option, subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time.\nIMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between 0.25% to 0.4% based on our consolidated leverage ratio and fees associated with outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, we had $784.4 million and $243.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan, respectively. Of the $784.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, $480.4 million was denominated in United States dollars, 190.0 million was denominated in Canadian dollars, 105.3 million was denominated in Euros and 71.6 million was denominated in Australian dollars. In addition, we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $36.6 million. The remaining amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015, based on IMI's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense (\"EBITDAR\"), other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was $678.9 million (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). The average interest rate in effect under the Credit Agreement was 2.7% as of December 31, 2015. The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.8% and ranged from 2.3% to 4.8% as of December 31, 2015 and the interest rate in effect under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 was 2.5%.\nThe Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.\nOur leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under both the Former Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and our leverage ratio under our indentures as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum//Minimum Allowable(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net total lease adjusted leverage ratio\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum allowable of 6.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum allowable of 4.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bond leverage ratio (not lease adjusted)\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum allowable of 6.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum allowable of 1.5\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The maximum and minimum allowable ratios under the Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the Former Credit Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted in the table above, our maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is 6.5. The Credit Agreement also contains a provision which limits, in certain circumstances, our dividends in any four consecutive fiscal quarters to 95% of Funds From Operations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for such four fiscal quarters or, if greater, the amount that we would be required to pay in order to continue to be qualified for taxation as a REIT or to avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on IMI. This limitation only is applicable when our net total lease adjusted leverage ratio exceeds 6.0.\nNoncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nIn September 2015, IMI completed a private offering of $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6% Notes due 2020. The net proceeds to IMI of $985.0 million, after paying the initial purchasers' commissions and expenses, were used to redeem all of the 63/4% Notes, 73/4% Notes and 83/8% Notes in October 2015. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the early extinguishment of this debt. This charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs.\nIn March 2015, we entered into a $250.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the \"Accounts Receivable Securitization Program\") involving several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. Under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, certain of our subsidiaries sell substantially all of their United States accounts receivable balances to our wholly owned special purpose entities, Iron Mountain Receivables QRS, LLC and Iron Mountain Receivables TRS, LLC (the \"Special Purpose Subsidiaries\"). The Special Purpose Subsidiaries use the accounts receivable balances to collateralize loans obtained from certain financial institutions. The Special Purpose Subsidiaries are consolidated subsidiaries of IMI. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is accounted for as a collateralized financing activity, rather than a sale of assets, and therefore: (i) accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral are presented as assets and borrowings are presented as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, (ii) our Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the associated charges for bad debt expense related to pledged accounts receivable (a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) and reductions to revenue due to billing and service related credit memos issued to customers and related reserves, as well as, interest expense associated with the collateralized borrowings and (iii) receipts from customers related to the underlying accounts receivable are reflected as operating cash flows and borrowings and repayments under the collateralized loans are reflected as financing cash flows within our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC (\"IMIM\") retains the responsibility of servicing the accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral in this transaction and IMI provides a performance guaranty. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program terminates on March 6, 2018, at which point all obligations become due. The maximum availability allowed is limited by eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the terms of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum availability allowed and amount outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was $205.9 million. The interest rate in effect under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was 1.3% as of December 31, 2015. Commitment fees at a rate of 40 basis points are charged on amounts made available but not borrowed under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program.\nCommitment fees and letters of credit fees, which are based on the unused balances under the Former Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitment fees and letters of credit fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.\nAcquisitions\nIn December 2015, in order to expand our offerings in our Adjacent Businesses operating segment, we acquired Crozier, a storage, logistics and transportation business for high value paintings, photographs and other types of art belonging to individual collectors, galleries and art museums for approximately $74.2 million.\nIn December 2015, in order to enhance our existing operations in India, we acquired the stock of Navbharat Archive XPress Private Limited (\"NAX\"), a storage and records management company with operations in India, for approximately $16.1 million. Of the total consideration, approximately $8.9 million was funded by us, while the remaining $7.2 million was contributed by the noncontrolling interest shareholder of our business in India. The amount contributed by our noncontrolling interest shareholder is presented as a source of cash within debt (repayment to) financing from and equity (distribution to) contribution from noncontrolling interests, net in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn addition to the acquisitions of Crozier and NAX noted above, during 2015, in order to enhance our existing operations in Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Hungary, India, Serbia, the United Kingdom and the United States, we completed 12 acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $27.6 million. These acquisitions included nine storage and records management companies, two storage and data management companies and one personal storage company. The individual purchase prices of these acquisitions ranged from approximately $1.0 million to $5.4 million.\nProposed Recall Acquisition\nOn June 8, 2015, we entered into the Recall Agreement with Recall to acquire Recall by way of the Scheme. Under the terms of the Recall Agreement, Recall shareholders are entitled to receive the Cash Supplement as well as either (1) 0.1722 shares of our common stock for each Recall share or (2) the Cash Election. The Cash Election is subject to the Cash Election Cap. Amounts paid to Recall shareholders that represent the Cash Supplement are excluded from the calculation of the Cash Election Cap. Assuming a sufficient number of Recall shareholders elect the Cash Election such that we pay the Cash Election Cap, we expect to issue approximately 50.7 million shares of our common stock and, based on the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of February 19, 2016, pay approximately US$323.0 million to Recall shareholders in connection with the Recall Transaction which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of February 19, 2016, would result in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately $1,791.0 million. Completion of the Scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, including among others, (i) approval by Recall shareholders of the Scheme by the requisite majority under the Australian Corporations Act, (ii) expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period and receipt of regulatory consents, approvals and clearances, in each case, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under relevant antitrust/competition and foreign investment legislation in other relevant jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any final, non-appealable order, decree or law preventing, making illegal or prohibiting the completion of the Recall Transaction, (iv) approval from the NYSE to the listing of additional shares of our common stock to be issued in the Recall Transaction, (v) the establishment of a secondary listing on the ASX to allow Recall shareholders to trade our common stock via CHESS Depository Interests on the ASX, (vi) Recall's delivery of tax opinions in accordance and in compliance with certain tax matter agreements to which Recall is a party and (vii) no events having occurred that would have a material adverse effect on Recall or us. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall Transaction and related integration planning.\nThere are significant costs associated with the Recall Transaction. We currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of approximately $80.0 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and approximately $300.0 million of Recall Integration Costs. Of these amounts, approximately $47.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2015 ($24.7 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and $22.4 million of Recall Integration Costs), including approximately $47.0 million of operating expenditures and approximately $0.1 million of capital expenditures.\nAdditionally, upon closing of the Recall Transaction we will incur costs associated with (i) the cash components of the purchase price noted above and (ii) the payoff of outstanding borrowings under Recall's existing revolving credit facility.\nWe expect the total cost to close the Recall Transaction (including Recall Deal Close Costs, the cash components of the purchase price and the payoff of Recall's revolving credit facility, but excluding Recall Integration Costs) to be approximately $1,100.0 million. We intend to fund these costs through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and, as necessary, public or private debt financing.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands):\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations)\n</td> <td>4,668,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,992,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,340,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payments(1)\n</td> <td>1,561,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>424,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations(2)\n</td> <td>2,000,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,036,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations\n</td> <td>109,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,575,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,253,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,811,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,897,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2015; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

We expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. As a REIT, we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy will naturally shift towards lower leverage, though our leverage has increased over the last several fiscal years to fund the costs of the REIT conversion and the Recall Transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).\nNet Operating Losses\nWe have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $70.8 million at December 31, 2015 to reduce future federal taxable income, on which $3.0 million of federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We can carry forward these net operating losses to the extent we do not utilize them in any given taxable year. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2016 through 2034, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $66.2 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 91%.\nInflation\nCertain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies, the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases and customer contracts which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges.", "summary": "The report discusses the proposed acquisition of Recall, divestitures, and cost optimization plans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThis discussion contains \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other securities laws. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page iii of this Annual Report and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" beginning on page 12 of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nProposed Recall Acquisition\nOn June 8, 2015, we entered into the Recall Agreement with Recall to acquire Recall by way of the Scheme. Under the terms of the Recall Agreement, Recall shareholders are entitled to receive the Cash Supplement as well as either (1) 0.1722 shares of our common stock for each Recall share or (2) the Cash Election. The Cash Election is subject to the Cash Election Cap. Amounts paid to Recall shareholders that represent the Cash Supplement are excluded from the calculation of the Cash Election Cap. Assuming a sufficient number of Recall shareholders elect the Cash Election such that we pay the Cash Election Cap, we expect to issue approximately 50.7 million shares of our common stock and, based on the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of February 19, 2016, pay approximately US$323.0 million to Recall shareholders in connection with the Recall Transaction which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of February 19, 2016, would result in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately $1,791.0 million. Completion of the Scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, including among others, (i) approval by Recall shareholders of the Scheme by the requisite majority under the Australian Corporations Act, (ii) expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period and receipt of regulatory consents, approvals and clearances, in each case, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under relevant antitrust/competition and foreign investment legislation in other relevant jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any final, non-appealable order, decree or law preventing, making illegal or prohibiting the completion of the Recall Transaction, (iv) approval from the NYSE to the listing of additional shares of our common stock to be issued in the Recall Transaction, (v) the establishment of a secondary listing on the ASX to allow Recall shareholders to trade our common stock via CHESS Depository Interests on the ASX, (vi) Recall's delivery of tax opinions in accordance and in compliance with certain tax matter agreements to which Recall is a party and (vii) no events having occurred that would have a material adverse effect on Recall or us. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall Transaction and related integration planning.\nWe currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of approximately $80.0 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and approximately $300.0 million of Recall Integration Costs. Of these amounts, approximately $47.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2015 ($24.7 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and $22.4 million of Recall Integration Costs), including approximately $47.0 million of operating expenditures and approximately $0.1 million of capital expenditures.\nDivestitures\nIn December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (the \"International Shredding Operations\") in a stock transaction for approximately $26.2 million of cash at closing. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. We have concluded that this divestiture did not meet the requirements to be presented as a discontinued operation and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of approximately $6.9 million ($10.2 million, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from our International Shredding Operations in 2014 represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. The International Shredding Operations in Australia were previously included in the Other International Business segment and the International Shredding Operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom were previously included in the Western European Business segment.\nCost Optimization Plans\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs (the Organizational Restructuring\u201d), which was completed in 2014. As a result of the Organizational Restructuring, we recorded charges of $23.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\n\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to reduce our overhead costs, particularly in our developed markets, in order to optimize our selling, general and administrative cost structure and to support investments to advance our growth strategy (the Transformation Initiative\u201d), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As a result of the Transformation Initiative, we recorded charges of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\n\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we implemented additional actions associated with our Transformation Initiative. As a result of these actions, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7.0 million, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits, and included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Of this charge, approximately $4.4 million, $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $1.8 million was associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Corporate and Other Business segments, respectively.\nAs we quantify incremental costs associated with future Transformation Initiative actions to achieve our $125.0 million cost reduction goal, we will disclose the relevant cost estimates and charges in the period that such actions are approved.\nGeneral\nAs a result of a realignment in our senior management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2015, we modified our internal financial reporting to better align internal reporting with how we manage our business. These modifications resulted in the separation of our former International Business segment into two unique reportable operating segments, which we refer to as (1) Western European Business segment and (2) Other International Business segment. Also, during the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed the nature of certain costs which were previously being allocated to the North American Records and Information Management Business and North American Data Management Business segments. As a result of this reassessment, we determined that certain product management functions, which were previously being performed to solely benefit our North American operating segments, are now being performed in a manner that benefits the enterprise as a whole. Accordingly, the costs associated with these product management functions are now included within the Corporate and Other Business segment. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment.\nAs a result of these changes noted above, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nOur revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code (\"Intellectual Property Management\"). Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent removal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) the storage, assembly and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders (\"Fulfillment Services\"); (9) consulting services; and (10) other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. While customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.\nCost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.\nThe expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international operations are more labor intensive than our operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international segment revenue. In addition, the overhead structure of our\nexpanding international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our North American segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates and the 2014 results at the 2015 average exchange rates.\nThe following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our United States dollar-reported revenues and expenses:\n\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, Recall Costs (as defined below) and REIT Costs (as defined below). Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs (as defined below); (5) REIT Costs (as defined below); (6) other expense (income), net; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP).\nReconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted OIBDA (in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes operating expenditures associated with our proposed acquisition of Recall, including costs to complete the Recall Transaction, including advisory and professional fees, as well as costs incurred to integrate Recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, REIT conversion and system upgrade costs (\"Recall Costs\"). \n (2) Includes costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, costs associated with our conversion to a REIT, excluding REIT compliance costs beginning January 1, 2014 which we expect to recur in future periods (\"REIT Costs\"). \nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/ write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs; (5) REIT Costs; (6) other expense (income), net; and (7) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.\nReconciliation of Reported EPS-Fully Diluted from Continuing Operations to Adjusted EPS-Fully Diluted from Continuing Operations:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been restated to reflect a structural tax rate of approximately 15.0%. Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a structural tax rate of approximately 14.4%. Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a structural tax rate of approximately 16.8%. The structural tax rates reflect the tax impact of the reconciling items above as well as discrete tax items. \nFFO (NAREIT) and FFO (Normalized)\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") and\nus as net income excluding (i) depreciation on real estate assets and (ii) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax ( FFO (NAREIT)\u201d). FFO (NAREIT) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (NAREIT) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (NAREIT) is net income. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to FFO (NAREIT) are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (NAREIT) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) Recall Costs; (4) REIT Costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) deferred income taxes and REIT tax adjustments; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO (NAREIT) and FFO (Normalized) (in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes depreciation expense related to real estate assets (land improvements, buildings, building improvements and racking). \n (2) Includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net of $58.3 million and $70.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. \n (3) REIT tax adjustments primarily include the impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings and accounting method changes related to our REIT conversion (including the impact of amended tax returns). \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nPart of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nEach acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition, as we acquire additional information impacting our estimates as of the acquisition date. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions.\nDetermining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOf the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of fair value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined internally. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.\nOf the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThis discussion contains \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other securities laws. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page iii of this Annual Report and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" beginning on page 12 of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nProposed Recall Acquisition\nOn June 8, 2015, we entered into the Recall Agreement with Recall to acquire Recall by way of the Scheme. Under the terms of the Recall Agreement, Recall shareholders are entitled to receive the Cash Supplement as well as either (1) 0.1722 shares of our common stock for each Recall share or (2) the Cash Election. The Cash Election is subject to the Cash Election Cap. Amounts paid to Recall shareholders that represent the Cash Supplement are excluded from the calculation of the Cash Election Cap. Assuming a sufficient number of Recall shareholders elect the Cash Election such that we pay the Cash Election Cap, we expect to issue approximately 50.7 million shares of our common stock and, based on the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of February 19, 2016, pay approximately US$323.0 million to Recall shareholders in connection with the Recall Transaction which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of February 19, 2016, would result in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately $1,791.0 million. Completion of the Scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, including among others, (i) approval by Recall shareholders of the Scheme by the requisite majority under the Australian Corporations Act, (ii) expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period and receipt of regulatory consents, approvals and clearances, in each case, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under relevant antitrust/competition and foreign investment legislation in other relevant jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any final, non-appealable order, decree or law preventing, making illegal or prohibiting the completion of the Recall Transaction, (iv) approval from the NYSE to the listing of additional shares of our common stock to be issued in the Recall Transaction, (v) the establishment of a secondary listing on the ASX to allow Recall shareholders to trade our common stock via CHESS Depository Interests on the ASX, (vi) Recall's delivery of tax opinions in accordance and in compliance with certain tax matter agreements to which Recall is a party and (vii) no events having occurred that would have a material adverse effect on Recall or us. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall Transaction and related integration planning.\nWe currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of approximately $80.0 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and approximately $300.0 million of Recall Integration Costs. Of these amounts, approximately $47.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2015 ($24.7 million of Recall Deal Close Costs and $22.4 million of Recall Integration Costs), including approximately $47.0 million of operating expenditures and approximately $0.1 million of capital expenditures.\nDivestitures\nIn December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (the \"International Shredding Operations\") in a stock transaction for approximately $26.2 million of cash at closing. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. We have concluded that this divestiture did not meet the requirements to be presented as a discontinued operation and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of approximately $6.9 million ($10.2 million, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from our International Shredding Operations in 2014 represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. The International Shredding Operations in Australia were previously included in the Other International Business segment and the International Shredding Operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom were previously included in the Western European Business segment.\nCost Optimization Plans\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs (the Organizational Restructuring\u201d), which was completed in 2014. As a result of the Organizational Restructuring, we recorded charges of $23.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Organizational Restructuring are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Records and Information Management Business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Data Management Business\n</td> <td>2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western European Business\n</td> <td>2,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other International Business\n</td> <td>1,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other Business\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to reduce our overhead costs, particularly in our developed markets, in order to optimize our selling, general and administrative cost structure and to support investments to advance our growth strategy (the Transformation Initiative\u201d), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As a result of the Transformation Initiative, we recorded charges of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in our results from operations associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts recorded by segment associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Records and Information Management Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American Data Management Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western European Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other International Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we implemented additional actions associated with our Transformation Initiative. As a result of these actions, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7.0 million, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits, and included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Of this charge, approximately $4.4 million, $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $1.8 million was associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Corporate and Other Business segments, respectively.\nAs we quantify incremental costs associated with future Transformation Initiative actions to achieve our $125.0 million cost reduction goal, we will disclose the relevant cost estimates and charges in the period that such actions are approved.\nGeneral\nAs a result of a realignment in our senior management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2015, we modified our internal financial reporting to better align internal reporting with how we manage our business. These modifications resulted in the separation of our former International Business segment into two unique reportable operating segments, which we refer to as (1) Western European Business segment and (2) Other International Business segment. Also, during the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed the nature of certain costs which were previously being allocated to the North American Records and Information Management Business and North American Data Management Business segments. As a result of this reassessment, we determined that certain product management functions, which were previously being performed to solely benefit our North American operating segments, are now being performed in a manner that benefits the enterprise as a whole. Accordingly, the costs associated with these product management functions are now included within the Corporate and Other Business segment. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment.\nAs a result of these changes noted above, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation.\nOur revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code (\"Intellectual Property Management\"). Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent removal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) the storage, assembly and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders (\"Fulfillment Services\"); (9) consulting services; and (10) other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. While customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.\nCost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.\nThe expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international operations are more labor intensive than our operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international segment revenue. In addition, the overhead structure of our\nexpanding international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our North American segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates and the 2014 results at the 2015 average exchange rates.\nThe following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our United States dollar-reported revenues and expenses:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Exchange\nRates for the\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nStrengthening /\n(Weakening) of\nForeign Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>British pound sterling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average Exchange\nRates for the\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nStrengthening /\n(Weakening) of\nForeign Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>British pound sterling\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, Recall Costs (as defined below) and REIT Costs (as defined below). Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs (as defined below); (5) REIT Costs (as defined below); (6) other expense (income), net; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP).\nReconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted OIBDA (in thousands):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>555,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>319,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible Impairments\n</td> <td>46,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on Disposal/Write-Down of Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Real Estate), Net\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recall Costs(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT Costs(2)\n</td> <td>15,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>949,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>910,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>894,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>925,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>920,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes operating expenditures associated with our proposed acquisition of Recall, including costs to complete the Recall Transaction, including advisory and professional fees, as well as costs incurred to integrate Recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, REIT conversion and system upgrade costs (\"Recall Costs\"). \n (2) Includes costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, costs associated with our conversion to a REIT, excluding REIT compliance costs beginning January 1, 2014 which we expect to recur in future periods (\"REIT Costs\"). \nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/ write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs; (5) REIT Costs; (6) other expense (income), net; and (7) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items.

FFO (NAREIT) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (NAREIT) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (NAREIT) is net income. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to FFO (NAREIT) are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (NAREIT) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) Recall Costs; (4) REIT Costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) deferred income taxes and REIT tax adjustments; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO (NAREIT) and FFO (Normalized) (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Real Estate Depreciation(1)\n</td> <td>184,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax\n</td> <td>(8,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (NAREIT)\n</td> <td>504,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Loss on Disposal/Write-Down of Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Real Estate), Net\n</td> <td>1,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recall Costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT Costs\n</td> <td>22,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Expense, Net(2)\n</td> <td>65,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred Income Taxes and REIT Tax Adjustments(3)\n</td> <td>(144,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO (Normalized)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes depreciation expense related to real estate assets (land improvements, buildings, building improvements and racking). \n (2) Includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net of $58.3 million and $70.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. \n (3) REIT tax adjustments primarily include the impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings and accounting method changes related to our REIT conversion (including the impact of amended tax returns). \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nPart of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nEach acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition, as we acquire additional information impacting our estimates as of the acquisition date. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions.\nDetermining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOf the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of fair value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined internally. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.\nOf the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions."}
