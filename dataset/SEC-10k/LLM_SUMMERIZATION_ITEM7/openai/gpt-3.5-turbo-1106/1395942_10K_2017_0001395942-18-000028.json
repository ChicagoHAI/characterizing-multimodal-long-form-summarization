Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties. In particular, statements made in this report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts (including, but not limited to, expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections regarding the industry, business, future operating results, potential acquisitions and anticipated cash requirements) may be forward-looking statements.

such, they involve risks which are not currently known that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied herein. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\nOur future growth depends on a variety of factors, including our ability to increase vehicle sold volumes and loan transaction volumes, expand our product and service offerings, including information systems development, acquire and integrate additional business entities, manage expansion, control costs in our operations, introduce fee increases, and retain our executive officers and key employees. We cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business.\nOverview\nWe provide whole car auction services and salvage auction services in North America and the United Kingdom. Our business is divided into three reportable business segments, each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry: ADESA Auctions, IAA and AFC.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The ADESA Auctions segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 75 whole car auction facilities in North America that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person. Through ADESA.com, powered by Openlane technology, ADESA offers comprehensive private label remarketing solutions to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies and other institutions to offer vehicles via the Internet prior to arrival at the physical auction. Vehicles at ADESA's auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators, financial institutions, rental car companies, new and used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchise and independent used vehicle dealers. ADESA also provides value-added ancillary services including inbound and outbound transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, titling, administrative and collateral recovery services. ADESA also includes ADESA Remarketing Limited, an online whole car vehicle remarketing business in the United Kingdom.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The IAA segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 175 salvage vehicle auction sites in the United States and Canada at December 31, 2017. IAA also includes HBC, which operates from 11 locations in the United Kingdom. The salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies, charity donation vehicles, recovered stolen (or theft) vehicles and low value used vehicles. The salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as inbound transportation, titling, salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services. Another important component of the IAA service offering is the ability to process large volumes of\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ntotal loss vehicles in a short period of time following catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, hail storms, fires or other natural disasters.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The AFC segment provides short-term, inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers. At December 31, 2017, AFC conducted business at 128 locations in the United States and Canada. The Company also sells vehicle service contracts through Preferred Warranties, Inc. (\"PWI\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate offices, such as salaries, benefits and travel costs for our management team, certain human resources, information technology and accounting costs, and certain insurance, treasury, legal and risk management costs. Holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on capital leases and the corporate debt structure. Intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain administrative costs allocated by the holding company.\nIndustry Trends\nWhole Car\nUsed vehicles sold in North America through whole car auctions, including online only sales, were approximately 9.9 million, 10.6 million and an estimated 11.1 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We expect that used vehicle auction volumes in North America, including online only volumes, will be over 11 million units in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Our estimates are based on information from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, IHS Automotive, Kontos Total Market Estimates, NAAA's annual survey and management estimates.\nSalvage\nVehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry. The percentage of claims resulting in total losses was approximately 18% in 2017, 17% in 2016 and 16% in 2015. There is no central reporting system for the salvage vehicle auction industry that tracks the number of salvage vehicle auction volumes in any given year, which makes estimating industry volumes difficult. We believe that salvage auction industry volumes will grow 5% to 7% annually, for the foreseeable future.\nFluctuations in used vehicle and commodity pricing (aluminum, steel, etc.) have an impact on proceeds received in the salvage vehicle auction industry. In times of rising prices, revenue and gross profit are positively impacted. If used vehicle and commodity prices decrease, proceeds, revenue and gross profit at salvage auctions may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect the level of profitability. During 2017, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $156 to $188 and finished December 2017 at $170. For comparison, during 2016, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $109 to $188 and finished December 2016 at $136.\nAutomotive Finance\nAFC works with independent used vehicle dealers to improve their results by providing a comprehensive set of business and financial solutions that leverages its local branches, industry experience and scale, as well as KAR affiliations. AFC's North American dealer base has grown since 2009 from over 9,700 dealers to approximately 15,400 dealers in 2017 and loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, grew from approximately 800,000 in 2009 to approximately 1,700,000 in 2017. As a result of this increased activity and increases in new and used vehicle sales, AFC continues to experience increased competition.\nKey challenges for the independent used vehicle dealer include demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory, lack of access to consumer financing and increased competition resulting from consolidation in the used vehicle dealer industry. These same challenges, to the extent they occur, could result in a material negative impact on AFC's results of operations. A significant decline in used vehicle sales would result in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans. In addition, volatility in wholesale vehicle pricing impacts the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans and the resulting severity of credit losses at AFC.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.\nSources of Revenues and Expenses\nOur revenue is derived from auction fees and related services associated with our whole car and salvage auctions, and from dealer financing fees, interest income and other service revenue at AFC. Although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold.\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, the cost of vehicles purchased, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices. Cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.\nResults of Operations\nOverview of Results of KAR Auction Services, Inc. for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,765.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IAA\n</td> <td>1,219.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC\n</td> <td>301.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>3,458.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>1,987.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,827.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>1,470.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,322.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>640.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>583.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>566.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>164.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on previously held equity interest value\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>398.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenue of $3,458.0 million compared with revenue of $3,150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 10%. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million or 3% of revenue. For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $24.0 million, or 10%, to $264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of certain assets placed in service over the last twelve months and depreciation and amortization for the assets of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $25.2 million, or 18%, to $164.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $273 million in the average outstanding balance of corporate debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as an increase in the weighted average interest rate for the same period of approximately 0.24%. In addition, there was an increase in interest expense at AFC of $9.5 million, which resulted from an increase in interest rates, increased borrowings and increased committed liquidity under the U.S. securitization agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $27.5 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and debt discounts associated with Term Loan B-2 and Term Loan B-3.\nIn March 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $4.0 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with Term Loan B-1 and unamortized debt issue costs associated with the 2014/2015 revolving credit facility. Additionally, in December 2016, we recorded a $1.4 million pretax charge primarily resulting from the write-off of a portion of unamortized securitization issuance costs associated with AFC's Receivables Purchase Agreement.\nGain on Previously Held Equity Interest Value\nIn October 2017, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in TradeRev and our previously held 50% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $21.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had an effective tax rate of 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an effective tax rate of 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $102.7 million relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and $11.1 million of expense associated with a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on the accumulated unrepatriated and untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that is payable over 8 years. We also recognized $6.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation as a discrete item in our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a reduction in income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nThe strengthening of the Canadian dollar has impacted the reporting of our Canadian operations in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2017, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate increased revenue by $7.6 million, operating profit by $2.7 million, net income by $1.6 million and net income per diluted share by $0.01.\nADESA Results\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions, except per vehicle amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,765.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>1,123.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,036.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>813.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>360.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>113.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>3,180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,885,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Physical auction vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,242,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,142,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Online only vehicles sold\n</td> <td>938,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Dealer consignment mix at physical auctions\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Conversion rate at North American physical auctions\n</td> <td>60.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold, excluding purchased vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online only revenue per vehicle sold, excluding ADESA Assurance Program vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from ADESA increased $172.2 million, or 10%, to $1,937.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 10%\nincrease in the number of vehicles sold (5% increase excluding acquisitions), partially offset by a less than 1% decrease in average revenue per vehicle sold as the mix of vehicles sold online increased as compared to the number of vehicles sold at physical auction. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million. Revenue increased $5.5 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nThe increase in vehicles sold was primarily attributable to a 15% increase in institutional volume (11% increase excluding acquisitions), including vehicles sold on our online only platform, as well as a 1% increase in dealer consignment units sold (7% decrease excluding acquisitions) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Online sales volume for ADESA represented approximately 45% of the total vehicles sold in 2017, compared with approximately 42% in 2016. \"Online sales\" includes the following: (i) selling vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); (ii) online solutions that offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); (iii) vehicles sold on the TradeRev platform; (iv) simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock\u00ae); and (v) bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock\u00ae). Upstream selling, midstream selling and TradeRev sales, which represent online only sales, accounted for approximately 66% of ADESA's online sales volume. ADESA sold approximately 938,000 and 743,000 vehicles (including 2% from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2017) through its online only offerings in 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which approximately 471,000 and 385,000 represented vehicle sales to grounding dealers in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dealer consignment vehicles represented approximately 45% of used vehicles sold at ADESA physical auction locations, compared with approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Vehicles sold at physical auction locations increased 5% (2% decrease excluding acquisitions) in 2017, compared with 2016. The used vehicle conversion percentage at North American physical auction locations, calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale at our ADESA auctions, increased to 60.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 58.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPhysical auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $22, or 3%, to $775 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $753 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold includes revenue from seller and buyer auction fees and ancillary and other related services, which includes non-auction services and excludes the sale of purchased vehicles. The increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold was primarily attributable to an increase in auction fees related to higher average transaction prices and lower margin ancillary and other related services revenue and an increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold of $2 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nOnline only auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $6 to $130 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $124 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold was attributable to an increase in purchased vehicles associated with the ADESA Assurance Program and the inclusion of TradeRev sales. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $113 and $110 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $3 increase in online only revenue per vehicle was attributable to increased revenue per vehicle for units sold on the TradeRev platform.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for ADESA increased $84.8 million, or 12%, to $813.6 million, compared with $728.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for ADESA was 42.0% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 41.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the increased mix of online only volume. Online only sales have a higher gross profit percentage than physical auction sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the ADESA segment increased $33.0 million, or 10%, to $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $327.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions of $27.7 million, compensation expense of $7.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million, information technology costs of $2.4 million, benefit-related expenses of $1.0 million, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate of $1.0 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $4.6 million, partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense of $4.5 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $4.4 million, marketing expenses of $2.5 million and professional fees of $2.0 million.\nIAA Results\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IAA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,219.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>778.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>441.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>107.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,369,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,184,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from IAA increased $121.2 million, or 11%, to $1,219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in vehicles sold of approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue per vehicle sold increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, and included an increase in revenue of $1.7 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate, partially offset by a decrease of $13.7 million from HBC and a decrease in revenue of $2.0 million due to fluctuations in the U.K. exchange rate. IAA's North American same-store total loss vehicle inventory increased approximately 3% at December 31, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, in part related to recent catastrophic events. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 5% and 7% of total salvage vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. North American online sales volumes for IAA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 60% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit at IAA increased to $441.1 million, or 36.2% of revenue, compared with $390.0 million, or 35.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to an 11% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 10% increase in cost of services, which included costs associated with purchase contract vehicles, costs incurred to store and process vehicles for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and organic volume growth.\nExcluding HBC, IAA's gross profit margin was 36.9% and 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, HBC had revenue of approximately $37.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively, and cost of services of approximately $32.2 million and $45.8 million, respectively, as fewer of HBC's vehicles were sold under purchase contracts. The entire selling price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchase contracts.\nIAA sold over 65,000 vehicles and recorded approximately $45.1 million of revenue and a $0.3 million gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to catastrophic events in Texas and Florida. Excluding these events (and HBC as noted above), IAA's gross profit margin was 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. IAA incurred significant costs in Texas and Florida in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Costs were incurred for real estate, security, lot operations and related support. These costs were incurred in advance of revenue. IAA recovered these excess costs incurred as vehicles were sold in 2017 and expects to recover the remainder of these excess costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at IAA increased $2.9 million, or 3%, to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $104.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense of $3.2 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, partially offset by decreases in employee related expenses of $1.5 million, bad debt expense of $0.9 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $1.3 million.\nAFC Results\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except volumes and per loan amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>(33.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service revenue\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AFC revenue\n</td> <td>301.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>85.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>216.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan transactions\n</td> <td>1,688,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,718,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per loan transaction, excluding \"Other service revenue\"\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, AFC revenue increased $14.5 million, or 5%, to $301.3 million, compared with $286.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was the result of a 7% increase in revenue per loan transactions and an increase of 3% in \"Other service revenue\" generated by PWI, partially offset by a decrease in loan transactions of 2%. The increase in revenue and revenue per loan transaction included the impact of an increase in revenue of $0.4 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate. In addition, managed receivables increased to $1,912.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $1,792.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nRevenue per loan transaction, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, increased $11, or 7%. The provision for credit losses, which is a reduction of revenue, resulted in a reduction of revenue per loan transaction of $2 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining $13 increase in revenue per loan transaction was primarily the result of increases in fee revenue and interest yield as a result of prime rate increases. Revenue per loan transaction excludes \"Other service revenue.\"\nThe provision for credit losses increased to 1.9% of the average managed receivables for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The provision for credit losses is expected to be under 2%, annually, of the average managed receivables balance. However, the actual losses in any particular quarter could deviate from this range.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for the AFC segment increased $12.2 million, or 6%, to $216.1 million, or 71.7% of revenue, compared with $203.9 million, or 71.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a 5% increase in revenue, which includes the increased provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 3% increase in cost of services. The increase in cost of services was the result of increases in compensation expense of $1.7 million, lot checks of $1.1 million and collection costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by decreases in PWI expenses of $1.1 million and other expenses aggregating $0.3 million. The floorplan lending business gross profit margin percentage was 77.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was consistent with the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at AFC increased $2.2 million, or 8%, to $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation expense of $0.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million, incentive-based compensation of $0.4 million and an increase in selling, general and administrative costs at PWI of $0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $0.2 million.\nHolding Company Results\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(169.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(144.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses at the holding company increased $19.0 million, or 15%, to $142.2 million, compared with $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increases in compensation expense of $11.5 million, information technology costs of $5.7 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $1.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expenses of $1.4 million. The Company has increased Holding Company expenses to support the growing businesses of KAR.

For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $27.8 million, or 13%, to $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $212.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of certain assets placed in service over the last twelve months and depreciation and amortization for the assets of businesses acquired in 2015 and 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $47.4 million, or 52%, to $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the interest associated with Term Loan B-3, the increase in interest rate on Term Loan B-2, as well as the interest associated with outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, there was an increase in interest expense at AFC of $10.0 million, which resulted from an increase in the average portfolio financed in 2016 as compared with 2015.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn March 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $4.0 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with Term Loan B-1 and unamortized debt issue costs associated with the 2014/2015 revolving credit facility. Additionally, in December 2016, we recorded a $1.4 million pretax charge primarily resulting from the write-off of a portion of unamortized securitization issuance costs associated with AFC's Receivables Purchase Agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had an effective tax rate of 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with an effective tax rate of 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nThe strengthening of the U.S. dollar has impacted the reporting of our Canadian operations in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2016, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate decreased revenue by $11.9 million, operating profit by $4.0 million, net income by $2.3 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02.\nADESA Results\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions, except per vehicle amounts)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,765.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>1,036.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>836.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>728.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>590.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>327.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,885,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,465,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Physical auction vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,142,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,873,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Online only vehicles sold\n</td> <td>743,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Dealer consignment mix at physical auctions\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Conversion rate at North American physical auctions\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold, excluding purchased vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online only revenue per vehicle sold, excluding ADESA Assurance Program vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from ADESA increased $337.5 million, or 24%, to $1,765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $1,427.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 17% increase in the number of vehicles sold (9% increase excluding acquisitions), as well as a 6% increase in revenue per vehicle sold. Businesses acquired in 2016 and 2015 accounted for an increase in revenue of $137.1 million. Revenue decreased $8.5 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nThe increase in volume sold was primarily attributable to a 22% increase in institutional volume (16% increase excluding acquisitions), including vehicles sold on our online only platform, as well as a 9% increase in dealer consignment units sold (2% decrease excluding acquisitions) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. Online sales volume for ADESA represented approximately 42% of the total vehicles sold in 2016, compared with approximately 40% in 2015. \"Online sales\" includes the following: (i) selling vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); (ii) online solutions that offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); (iii) simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock\u00ae); and (iv) bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock\u00ae). Upstream and midstream selling represent online only sales, which accounted for approximately 63% of ADESA's online sales volume. ADESA sold approximately 743,000 and 592,000 vehicles through its online only offerings in 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which approximately 385,000 and 352,000 represented vehicle sales to grounding dealers in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, dealer consignment vehicles represented approximately 48% of used vehicles sold at ADESA physical auction locations, compared with approximately 50% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Vehicles sold at physical auction locations increased 14% (4% increase excluding acquisitions) in 2016, compared with 2015. The used vehicle conversion percentage at North American physical auction locations, calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale at our ADESA auctions was 58.0% and 58.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nPhysical auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $52, or 7%, to $753 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $701 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold includes revenue from seller and buyer auction fees and ancillary and other related services, which includes non-auction services and excludes the sale of purchased vehicles. The increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold was primarily attributable to an increase in lower margin ancillary and other related services revenue, including revenue from certain businesses acquired, partially offset by a decrease in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold of $4 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nOnline only auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $17 to $124 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $107 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold was attributable to an increase in purchased vehicles associated with the ADESA Assurance Program and an increase in the mix of cars sold in closed sales to non-grounding dealers, partially offset by a decrease in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold of $1 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $110 and $102 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit for ADESA increased $137.9 million, or 23%, to $728.8 million, compared with $590.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit for ADESA was 41.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 41.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the 17% increase in the number of vehicles sold.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the ADESA segment increased $50.4 million, or 18%, to $327.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $276.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions of $27.7 million, compensation expense of $11.8 million, bad debt expense of $5.1 million, information technology costs of $3.3 million, professional fees of $1.9 million, benefit-related expenses of $1.6 million, supply and mailing expenses of $1.5 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $3.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of $3.1 million, a decrease in the loss on disposal of certain assets of $1.7 million and fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate of $1.5 million.\nIAA Results\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IAA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>994.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>708.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>633.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>390.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,184,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,970,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from IAA increased $103.6 million, or 10%, to $1,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $994.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and included an increase in revenue of $25.8 million from HBC (HBC was acquired in June 2015). The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in vehicles sold of approximately 11% (10% excluding HBC) for the year ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $6.9 million due to fluctuations in the U.K. exchange rate and $2.8 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate. Revenue per vehicle sold was consistent year over year. IAA's North American same-store total loss vehicle inventory increased approximately 25% at December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, in part related to recent catastrophic events. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 7% (5% excluding HBC) and 7% (6% excluding HBC) of total salvage vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Online sales volumes for IAA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 represented approximately 60% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit at IAA increased to $390.0 million, or 35.5% of revenue, compared with $360.8 million, or 36.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to a 10% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 12% increase in cost of services, which included costs associated with purchase contract vehicles and volume growth. Excluding HBC, IAA's gross profit margin was 36.7% and 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, HBC had revenue of approximately $51.6 million and $25.8 million, respectively, and cost of services of approximately $45.8 million and $23.5 million, respectively, as the majority of HBC's vehicles are sold under purchase contracts. HBC accounted for a 0.5% decrease in IAA's gross profit margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at IAA increased $6.1 million, or 6%, to $104.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses at HBC of $1.5 million, increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, telecom costs of $1.1 million, bad debt expense of $0.9 million, benefit-related expenses of $0.9 million, non-income based taxes of $0.7 million, employee related expenses of $0.4 million, incentive-based compensation of $0.4 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $1.3 million, partially offset by decreases in professional fees of $1.6 million and travel expenses of $0.8 million.\nAFC Results\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except volumes and per loan amounts)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service revenue\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AFC revenue\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>82.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>203.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan transactions\n</td> <td>1,718,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,607,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per loan transaction, excluding \"Other service revenue\"\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, AFC revenue increased $18.4 million, or 7%, to $286.8 million, compared with $268.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was the result of a 7% increase in loan transactions and an increase of 15% in \"Other service revenue\" generated by PWI, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses to 1.8% of the average managed receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue and decrease in revenue per loan transaction included the impact of a decrease in revenue of $0.6 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate. In addition, managed receivables increased to $1,792.2 million at December 31, 2016 from $1,641.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nRevenue per loan transaction, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, decreased $2, or 1%, primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for credit losses, a decrease in floorplan fee income per unit and a decrease in interest yield, partially offset by increases in average loan values, other revenue and average portfolio duration. Revenue per loan transaction excludes \"Other service revenue.\"\nThe provision for credit losses increased to 1.8% from 1.1% of the average managed receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit for the AFC segment increased $13.5 million, or 7%, to $203.9 million, or 71.1% of revenue, compared with $190.4 million, or 70.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a 7% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 6% increase in cost of services. The floorplan lending business gross profit margin percentage increased from 77.5% to 77.7%. The gross profit margin percentage in the warranty service contract business also improved.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at AFC increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million, information technology costs of $0.7 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in incentive-based compensation of $0.6 million and a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs at PWI of $0.4 million.\nHolding Company Results\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(144.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(114.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses at the holding company increased $23.7 million, or 24%, to $123.2 million, compared with $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increases in compensation expense of $8.7 million, professional fees of $7.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $1.8 million, acquisition-related professional fees of $1.7 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $2.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in medical expenses of $1.6 million.

Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $10.0 million or 1% of revenue. For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below.\nGain on Previously Held Equity Interest Value\nIn October 2017, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in TradeRev and our previously held 50% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $21.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had an effective tax rate of (67.6%) for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with an effective tax rate of 37.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $102.7 million relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and $11.1 million of expense associated with a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on the accumulated unrepatriated and untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that is payable over 8 years. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a reduction in income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings.\nADESA Results\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions, except per vehicle amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>442.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>281.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>191.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>744,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Physical auction vehicles sold\n</td> <td>507,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Online only vehicles sold\n</td> <td>237,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Dealer consignment mix at physical auctions\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Conversion rate at North American physical auctions\n</td> <td>57.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold, excluding purchased vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online only revenue per vehicle sold, excluding ADESA Assurance Program vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from ADESA increased $30.9 million, or 7%, to $473.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $442.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 6% increase in the number of vehicles sold (3% increase excluding acquisitions) and a 1% increase in average revenue per vehicle sold. Businesses acquired in the last 12 months accounted for an increase in revenue of $10.0 million. Revenue increased $3.5 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nThe increase in vehicles sold was primarily attributable to a 9% increase in institutional volume (8% increase excluding acquisitions), including vehicles sold on our online only platform, as well as a 2% increase in dealer consignment units sold (8% decrease excluding acquisitions) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. Online sales volume for ADESA represented approximately 48% of the total vehicles sold in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with approximately 41% in the fourth quarter of 2016. \"Online sales\" includes the following: (i) selling vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); (ii) online solutions that offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); (iii) vehicles sold on the TradeRev platform; (iv) simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock\u00ae); and (v) bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock\u00ae). Upstream selling, midstream selling and TradeRev sales, which represent online only sales, accounted for approximately 68% of ADESA's online sales volume. ADESA sold approximately 237,000 and 177,000 vehicles (including 8% from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2017) through its online only offerings in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which approximately 116,000 and 88,000 represented vehicle sales to grounding dealers in the\nfourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, dealer consignment vehicles represented approximately 44% of used vehicles sold at ADESA physical auction locations, compared with approximately 45% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Vehicles sold at physical auction locations decreased 3% (4% decrease excluding acquisitions) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The used vehicle conversion percentage at North American physical auction locations, calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale at our ADESA auctions, increased to 57.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with 54.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nPhysical auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $49, or 6%, to $822 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $773 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold includes revenue from seller and buyer auction fees and ancillary and other related services, which includes non-auction services and excludes the sale of purchased vehicles. The increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold was primarily attributable to an increase in auction fees related to higher average transaction prices and an increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold of $7 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nOnline only auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $17 to $148 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $131 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold was attributable to an increase in purchased vehicles associated with the ADESA Assurance Program and the inclusion of TradeRev sales. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $122 and $115 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program and vehicles sold on the TradeRev platform, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $111 for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nGross Profit\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for ADESA increased $18.6 million, or 11%, to $191.5 million, compared with $172.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for ADESA was 40.5% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with 39.1% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the increase in online only volume and an increase in physical auction revenue.

Revenue per vehicle sold\nincreased 6% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016, and included an increase in revenue of $1.1 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate, partially offset by a decrease of $4.4 million from HBC and a decrease in revenue of $0.5 million due to fluctuations in the U.K. exchange rate. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 4% and 6% of total salvage vehicles sold for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. North American online sales volumes for IAA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 60% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.\nGross Profit\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit at IAA increased to $112.7 million, or 33.6% of revenue, compared with $103.9 million, or 34.3% of revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to an 11% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 12% increase in cost of services, which included costs associated with purchase contract vehicles and volume growth.\nExcluding HBC, IAA's gross profit margin was 33.9% and 35.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, HBC had revenue of approximately $7.6 million and $12.0 million, respectively, and cost of services of approximately $6.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as fewer of HBC's vehicles were sold under purchase contracts. The entire selling price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchase contracts.\nIAA sold over 65,000 vehicles and recorded approximately $44.6 million of revenue and $4.0 million of gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 related to catastrophic events in Texas and Florida. Excluding these events (and HBC as noted above), IAA's gross profit margin was 37.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. IAA incurred significant costs in Texas and Florida in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Costs were incurred for real estate, security, lot operations and related support. IAA recovered these excess costs incurred as vehicles were sold in the fourth quarter of 2017 and expects to recover the remainder of these excess costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at IAA increased $1.9 million, or 8%, to $27.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $25.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in incentive-based compensation expense of $0.7 million, professional fees of $0.7 million, supply expenses of $0.5 million, compensation expense of $0.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense of $0.5 million and marketing expenses of $0.5 million.\nAFC Results\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except volumes and per loan amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service revenue\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AFC revenue\n</td> <td>81.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan transactions\n</td> <td>414,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per loan transaction, excluding \"Other service revenue\"\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, AFC revenue increased $13.0 million, or 19%, to $81.8 million, compared with $68.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was the result of an increase in revenue per loan transaction of 23%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in \"Other service revenue\" generated by PWI and a decrease in loan transactions of 1%.\nRevenue per loan transaction, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, increased $33, or 23%. The decrease in provision for credit losses, which is a reduction of revenue, resulted in an increase in revenue per loan transaction of $13 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The remaining $20 increase in revenue per loan transaction was primarily the result of increases in fee revenue and interest yield as a result of prime rate increases. Revenue per loan transaction excludes \"Other service revenue.\"\nThe provision for credit losses decreased to 1.4% of the average managed receivables for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 2.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for credit losses is expected to be under 2%, annually, of the average managed receivables balance. However, the actual losses in any particular quarter could deviate from this range.\nGross Profit\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for the AFC segment increased $12.5 million, or 26%, to $61.1 million, or 74.7% of revenue, compared with $48.6 million, or 70.6% of revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a 19% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 2% increase in cost of services. The increase in cost of services was the result of increases in compensation expense of $0.6 million and other expenses aggregating $0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in PWI expenses of $0.3 million. The floorplan lending business gross profit margin percentage increased from 76.8% to 79.8% as a result of higher revenue per loan transaction.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at AFC increased $1.7 million, or 25%, to $8.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in incentive-based compensation expense of $1.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million other expenses aggregating $0.2 million.\nHolding Company Results\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses at the holding company increased $9.4 million, or 34%, to $36.9 million, compared with $27.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, information technology costs of $1.8 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, medical expenses of $1.6 million, compensation expense of $1.4 million and other expenses aggregating $1.0 million. The Company has increased Holding Company expenses to support the growing businesses of KAR. The increase in expenses relate to costs associated with talent management, technology and support of strategic initiatives.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe that the significant indicators of liquidity for our business are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, working capital and amounts available under our Credit Facility. Our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>748.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts available under Credit Facility*\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operations for the year ended\n</td> <td>588.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>There were related outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $42.8 million and $29.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which reduced the amount available for borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We regularly evaluate alternatives for our capital structure and liquidity given our expected cash flows, growth and operating capital requirements as well as capital market conditions.\nWorking Capital\nA substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services provided. The majority of our working capital needs are short-term in nature, usually less than a week in duration. Due to the decentralized nature of the business, payments for most vehicles purchased are received at each auction and branch. Most of the financial institutions place a temporary hold on the availability of the funds deposited that generally can range up to two business days, resulting in cash in our accounts and on our balance sheet that is unavailable for use until it is made available by the various financial institutions. There are outstanding checks (book overdrafts) to sellers and vendors included in current liabilities. Because a portion of these outstanding checks for operations in the U.S. are drawn upon bank accounts at financial institutions other than the financial institutions that hold the cash, we cannot offset all the cash and the outstanding checks on our balance sheet. Changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of collections and disbursements of funds to consignors from auctions held near period end.\nApproximately $70.8 million of available cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017. If the portion of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently reinvested were to be repatriated, state and local income tax expense and withholding tax expense would need to be recognized, net of any applicable foreign tax credits.\nAFC offers short-term inventory-secured financing, also known as floorplan financing, to independent used vehicle dealers. Financing is primarily provided for terms of 30 to 90 days. AFC principally generates its funding through the sale of its receivables. The receivables sold pursuant to the securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings. For further discussion of AFC's securitization arrangements, see \"Securitization Facilities.\"\nImpact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we estimate that our future effective tax rate will be 26% - 28%. The major provisions affecting the Company include a reduction in our federal income tax rate, the immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures and a reduced deduction for certain executive compensation. The impact of these changes, if they had applied to 2017, would have been a reduction in cash taxes of over $40 million and an increase in earnings per share of $0.30. In addition, the Company recorded an obligation for approximately $11.1 million in U.S. income taxes for unremitted foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. In future years, there will be no federal U.S. taxes on funds repatriated from foreign operations; however, state and local income tax expense and withholding tax expense would be recognized, net of any applicable foreign tax credits.\nCredit Facilities\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into an Incremental Commitment Agreement and Second Amendment (the \"Second Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment provided for, among other things, (i) the refinancing and repricing of the existing tranche B-2 term loans (\"Term Loan B-2\") remaining after the repayment with new tranche B-4 term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $717 million (\"Term Loan B-4\"), (ii) the refinancing and repricing of existing tranche\nB-3 term loans (\"Term Loan B-3\") remaining after the repayment with new tranche B-5 term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion (\"Term Loan B-5\") and (iii) a $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"revolving credit facility\"). A portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the senior notes was used to repay a portion of Term Loan B-2 and Term Loan B-3, as well as the outstanding balance on the 2016 revolving credit facility. No early termination penalties were incurred by the Company; however, we incurred a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt of $27.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. The loss was a result of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and debt discounts associated with Term Loan B-2 and Term Loan B-3. We capitalized approximately $7.8 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Second Amendment.\nThe Credit Facility is available for letters of credit, working capital, permitted acquisitions and general corporate\npurposes. The Credit Agreement provides that with respect to the revolving credit facility, up to $75 million is available for\nletters of credit and up to $90 million is available for swing line loans.\nBoth Term Loan B-4 and Term Loan B-5 are payable in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of their respective original aggregate principal amounts. Such payments commenced on September 30, 2017, with the balances payable at each respective maturity date. The Credit Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and reduction in an amount equal to the net proceeds of certain debt offerings, certain asset sales and certain insurance recovery events. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, 50% of the net cash proceeds from the sale-leaseback of certain technology and capital equipment were used to prepay $5.7 million and $8.4 million of Term Loan B-4 and Term Loan B-5, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Each such prepayment is credited to prepay, on a pro rata basis, in order of maturity the unpaid amounts due on the first eight scheduled quarterly installments of Term Loan B-4 and Term Loan B-5 and thereafter to the remaining scheduled quarterly installments of each term loan on a pro rata basis.\nAs set forth in the Credit Agreement, Term Loan B-4 bears interest at Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) plus 2.25%, Term Loan B-5 at Adjusted LIBOR plus 2.50% and revolving loan borrowings at Adjusted LIBOR plus 2.0%. However, for specified types of borrowings, the Company may elect to make Term Loan B-4 borrowings at a Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.25%, Term Loan B-5 at a Base Rate plus 1.50% and revolving loan borrowings at a Base Rate plus 1.0%. The rates on Term Loan B-4 and Term Loan B-5 were 4.00% and 4.25% at December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, if the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which is based on a net debt calculation, increases to levels specified in the Credit Agreement, the applicable interest rate on the revolving credit facility will step up by 25 basis points. The Company also pays a commitment fee of 30 to 35 basis points, payable quarterly, on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility based on the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as described above.\nOn December 31, 2017, $711.3 million was outstanding on Term Loan B-4, $1,041.6 million was outstanding on Term Loan B-5 and there were no borrowings on the revolving credit facility. In addition, we had related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $42.8 million and $29.7 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Our Canadian operations also have a C$8 million line of credit which was undrawn at December 31, 2017. However, there were related letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately C$1.0 million at December 31, 2017, which reduce amounts available under the Canadian line of credit.\nThe obligations of the Company under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\") and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) pledges of and first priority perfected security interests in 100% of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' first tier foreign subsidiaries and (b) perfected first priority security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, a financial covenant requiring that a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio be satisfied as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if revolving loans are outstanding, and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, consummate change of control transactions, dispose of assets, pay dividends, make investments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as total senior secured debt divided by the last four quarters consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Senior secured debt includes term loan borrowings, revolving loans and capital lease liabilities less available cash as defined in the Credit Agreement. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude among other things (a) gains and losses from asset sales; (b) unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness; (c) certain non-recurring gains and losses; (d) stock-based compensation expense; (e) certain other non-cash amounts included in the determination of net income; (f) charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting; (g) minority interest; (h) expenses associated with the consolidation of\nsalvage operations; (i) consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction, operating restructuring and business improvement efforts; (j) expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases, software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts; (k) expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions; (l) any impairment charges or write-offs of intangibles; and (m) any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges, expenses or losses.\nCertain covenants contained within the Credit Agreement are critical to an investor's understanding of our financial liquidity, as the failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could result in a default and allow our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable. The maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is required to be met when there are revolving loans outstanding under our Credit Agreement. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017 the ratio could not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. Our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio, including capital lease obligations of $54.8 million, was 2.01 to 1.0 at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes contain certain financial and operational restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and other distributions, make certain acquisitions or investments, incur indebtedness, grant liens and sell assets. The covenants in the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes affect our operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes. We were in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes at December 31, 2017.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand, working capital, cash provided by operating activities, and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our short and long-term operating needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements, debt service payments, announced acquisitions and dividends for the next twelve months.\nSenior Notes\nOn May 31, 2017, we issued $950 million of 5.125% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The Company will pay interest on the senior notes semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced on December 1, 2017. We may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2020 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and thereafter at a premium that declines ratably to par in 2023. We capitalized approximately $14.7 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the senior notes. The senior notes are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.\nSecuritization Facilities\nAFC sells the majority of its U.S. dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to AFC Funding Corporation. A securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by AFC Funding Corporation to a group of bank purchasers of undivided interests in certain finance receivables subject to committed liquidity. The agreement expires on January 31, 2020. AFC Funding Corporation had committed liquidity of $1.50 billion for U.S. finance receivables at December 31, 2017.\nWe also have an agreement for the securitization of AFCI's receivables. AFCI's committed facility is provided through a third party conduit (separate from the U.S. facility) and was C$125 million at December 31, 2017. The receivables sold pursuant to both the U.S. and Canadian securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nAFC managed total finance receivables of $1,912.6 million and $1,792.2 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. AFC's allowance for losses was $13.0 million and $12.0 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $1,893.2 million and $1,774.8 million, respectively, of finance receivables and a cash reserve of 1 percent of the obligations collateralized by finance receivables served as security for the $1,358.1 million and $1,280.3 million of obligations collateralized by finance receivables at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. There were unamortized securitization issuance costs of approximately $13.3 million and $19.7 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. After the occurrence of a termination event, as defined in the U.S. securitization agreement, the banks may, and could, cause the stock of AFC Funding Corporation to be transferred to the bank facility, though as a practical matter the bank facility would look to the liquidation of the receivables under the transaction documents as their primary remedy.\nProceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank facilities are used to fund new loans to customers. AFC, AFC Funding Corporation and AFCI must maintain certain financial covenants including, among others, limits on the amount of debt AFC and AFCI can incur, minimum levels of tangible net worth, and other covenants tied to the performance of the finance\nreceivables portfolio. The securitization agreements also incorporate the financial covenants of our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants in the securitization agreements.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings, as described above in the discussion of certain restrictive loan covenants under \"Credit Facilities.\"\nManagement believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods presented:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Capital expenditures were funded primarily from internally generated funds. We continue to invest in our core information technology capabilities and capacity expansion. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $185 million for fiscal year 2018, including the purchase of IAA property in Florida for use during catastrophic events. Approximately half of the 2018 capital expenditures are expected to relate to technology-based investments. Anticipated capital expenditures are primarily attributable to improvements and expansion at vehicle auction facilities and improvements in information technology systems and infrastructure. Future capital expenditures could vary substantially based on capital project timing, the opening of new auction facilities, capital expenditures related to acquired businesses and the initiation of new information systems projects to support our business strategies.\nDividends\nSubject to board of director approval, we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in 2018 using cash flow from operations, representing an annualized dividend of $1.40 per share.

No assurance can be given as to whether any future dividends may be declared by our board of directors or the amount thereof.\nAcquisitions\nThe aggregate purchase price for the businesses acquired in 2017, net of cash acquired, was approximately $103.9 million, which included deferred payments with a fair value of $6.6 million and estimated contingent payments with a fair value of $24.0 million. The maximum amount of undiscounted contingent payments related to these acquisitions could approximate $60.0 million. The purchase price for the acquired businesses was allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based upon fair values, including $29.4 million to intangible assets, representing the fair value of acquired customer relationships of $3.1 million, software of $24.0 million and tradenames of $2.3 million, which are being amortized over their expected useful lives. The acquisitions resulted in aggregate goodwill of $130.7 million. The goodwill is recorded in the ADESA Auctions reportable segment. The financial impact of these acquisitions, including pro forma financial results, was immaterial to the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn April 2017, the Company purchased all of the stock of CarCo Technologies, Inc. ( DRIVIN\u201d). DRIVIN aggregates automotive retail, pricing, registration and other market and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. The insights generated from that data are deployed through predictive pricing, inventory management and vehicle matching tools that help customers buy, sell and source vehicles.\nIn May 2017, the Company acquired Dependable Auto Shippers (\"DAS\"). DAS provides vehicle transportation services for corporate and personal vehicle transportation needs.\nIn October 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Nth Gen Software Inc. (\"TradeRev\"). TradeRev brings mobile and digital technology to the Company's portfolio of whole car and salvage auctions, floorplan financing solutions, and other ancillary and related services. The Company plans to further integrate those capabilities into TradeRev to expand its digital business and strengthen its share in the dealer-to-dealer market. Upon acquisition, our previously held interest in TradeRev was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $21.6 million. The gain has been recognized as \"Gain on previously held equity interest value\" in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also entered into operating lease obligations related to various facilities through 2028. Initial annual lease payments for the various facilities are approximately $1.8 million per year.\nIn December 2017, the Company acquired POIS, Inc. POIS provides loan payoff and lien release technology with a focus on helping insurance companies settle liens faster to improve cycle time/inventory turns.\nCertain of the purchase agreements included contingent payments related to vehicle volumes subsequent to the purchase date. The purchased assets included accounts receivable, inventory, customer relationships, tradenames, software and other intangible assets. Financial results for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2018, the Company acquired STRATIM Systems Inc. (\"STRATIM\"). STRATIM is a mobility and fleet management software company based in San Francisco, California that uses data analytics to help fleet owners manage, maintain and service their fleets. The addition of STRATIM supplements KAR's broad portfolio of wholesale used vehicle physical, online and digital auction marketplaces and ancillary service providers. The purchase accounting related to this acquisition is incomplete. Financial results for STRATIM will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below sets forth a summary of our contractual debt and lease obligations as of December 31, 2017. Some of the figures included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we may actually pay in future periods could vary from those reflected in the table.

Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex. Consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting measurements that management believes are most critical to the reported results of our operations and financial condition include: (1) allowance for credit losses; (2) business combinations; (3) goodwill and other intangible assets; and (4) legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\nIn addition to the critical accounting estimates, there are other items used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In cases where management estimates are used, they are based on historical experience, information from third-party professionals, and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. In addition, our most significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 and elsewhere in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides the primary basis for estimating the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is also based on management's evaluation of the receivables portfolio under current economic conditions, the size of the portfolio, overall portfolio credit quality, review of specific collection matters and such other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve recognition in estimating losses. Specific collection matters can be impacted by the outcome of negotiations, litigation and bankruptcy proceedings with individual customers.\nAFC controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, underwriting and collateral management monitoring procedures, including over 85,000 lot audits and holding vehicle titles where permitted. The estimates are based on management's evaluation of many factors, including AFC's historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends and economic conditions. The estimates are based on information available as of each reporting date. Actual losses may differ from the original estimates due to actual results varying from those assumed in our estimates.\nAs a measure of sensitivity, if we had experienced a 10% increase in net charge-offs of finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2017, our provision for credit losses would have increased by approximately $3.3 million in 2017.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire businesses, we estimate and recognize the fair values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase accounting process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets and contingent consideration.\nCritical estimates are often developed using valuation models that are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, growth rates, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually during the second quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and our market valuation relative to our book value. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that a reporting unit's fair value is not more likely than not greater than its carrying value, then we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows and market approaches.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for a reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and earnings, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives and changes in economic conditions. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approach are highly subjective, and our\nability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies. In 2017, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. Based on our goodwill assessments, the Company has not identified a reporting unit for which the goodwill was impaired in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nAs with goodwill, we assess indefinite-lived tradenames for impairment annually during the second quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. When assessing indefinite-lived tradenames for impairment using a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the tradename asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the tradename asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies.\nWe review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying amount of an other intangible asset exceeds the total amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that asset, we would recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Management judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for recovery is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows. Our impairment analysis is based on the current business strategy, expected growth rates and estimated future economic conditions.\nLegal Proceedings and Other Loss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various legal proceedings and other loss contingencies, many involving litigation incidental to the business and a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Litigation and other loss contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes of such matters are often very difficult to predict and generally are resolved over long periods of time. We consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. Estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often are dependent on the judgment about potential actions by third parties. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies. We accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted. If the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued, this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a description of new accounting standards that could affect the Company, reference the \"New Accounting Standards\" section of Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report is a discussion of the financial condition and operations of the company, with a focus on forward-looking statements and risk factors. The report describes the company's three reportable business segments: ADESA Auctions, IAA, and AFC, and discusses industry trends for whole car auctions, salvage auctions, and automotive finance.\n\nThe report provides a summary of the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, including revenue, costs, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, operating profit, interest expense, income taxes, net income, and earnings per share for each business segment.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced increases in revenue and gross profit for each business segment, with ADESA and IAA highlighting growth in vehicles sold and revenue. AFC saw an increase in interest and fee income and other service revenue, which contributed to an increase in total revenue. Despite increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses, the company achieved growth in operating profit for each business segment compared to the previous year.", "item_7_tables": "Table

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties. In particular, statements made in this report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts (including, but not limited to, expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections regarding the industry, business, future operating results, potential acquisitions and anticipated cash requirements) may be forward-looking statements. Words such as \"should,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, including statements regarding our future growth; anticipated cost savings, revenue increases, credit losses and capital expenditures; dividend declarations and payments; common stock repurchases; tax rates and assumptions; strategic initiatives, greenfields and acquisitions; our competitive position and retention of customers; and our continued investment in information technology, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these factors include:\n \u2022 our ability to effectively maintain or update information and technology systems; \n \u2022 our ability to implement and maintain measures to protect against cyber-attacks; \n \u2022 significant current competition and the introduction of new competitors; \n \u2022 competitive pricing pressures; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully implement our business strategies or realize expected cost savings and revenue enhancements; \n \u2022 our ability to meet or exceed customers' expectations, as well as develop and implement information systems responsive to customer needs; \n \u2022 business development activities, including greenfields, acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses; \n \u2022 costs associated with the acquisition of businesses or technologies; \n \u2022 fluctuations in consumer demand for and in the supply of used, leased and salvage vehicles and the resulting impact on auction sales volumes, conversion rates and loan transaction volumes; \n \u2022 any losses of key personnel; \n \u2022 our ability to obtain land or renew/enter into new leases at commercially reasonable rates; \n \u2022 decreases in the number of used vehicles sold at physical auctions; \n \u2022 changes in the market value of vehicles auctioned, including changes in the actual cash value of salvage vehicles; \n \u2022 trends in new and used vehicle sales and incentives, including wholesale used vehicle pricing; \n \u2022 the ability of consumers to lease or finance the purchase of new and/or used vehicles; \n \u2022 the ability to recover or collect from delinquent or bankrupt customers; \n \u2022 economic conditions including fuel prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rate fluctuations; \n \u2022 trends in the vehicle remarketing industry; \n \u2022 trends in the number of commercial vehicles being brought to auction, in particular off-lease volumes; \n \u2022 changes in the volume of vehicle production, including capacity reductions at the major original equipment manufacturers; \n \u2022 laws, regulations and industry standards, including changes in regulations governing the sale of used vehicles, the processing of salvage vehicles and commercial lending activities; \n \u2022 our ability to maintain our brand and protect our intellectual property; \n \u2022 the costs of environmental compliance and/or the imposition of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations; \n \u2022 weather, including increased expenses as a result of catastrophic events; \n \u2022 general business conditions; \n \u2022 our substantial amount of debt; \n \u2022 restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; \n \u2022 our assumption of the settlement risk for vehicles sold; \n \u2022 litigation developments; \n \u2022 our self-insurance for certain risks; \n \u2022 interruptions to service from our workforce; \n \u2022 any impairment to our goodwill or other intangible assets; \n \u2022 changes in effective tax rates; \n \u2022 changes to accounting standards; and \n \u2022 other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in 2018.  Many of these risk factors are outside of our control, and as such, they involve risks which are not currently known that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied herein. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\nOur future growth depends on a variety of factors, including our ability to increase vehicle sold volumes and loan transaction volumes, expand our product and service offerings, including information systems development, acquire and integrate additional business entities, manage expansion, control costs in our operations, introduce fee increases, and retain our executive officers and key employees. We cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business.\nOverview\nWe provide whole car auction services and salvage auction services in North America and the United Kingdom. Our business is divided into three reportable business segments, each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry: ADESA Auctions, IAA and AFC.\n \u2022 The ADESA Auctions segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 75 whole car auction facilities in North America that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person. Through ADESA.com, powered by Openlane technology, ADESA offers comprehensive private label remarketing solutions to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies and other institutions to offer vehicles via the Internet prior to arrival at the physical auction. Vehicles at ADESA's auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators, financial institutions, rental car companies, new and used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchise and independent used vehicle dealers. ADESA also provides value-added ancillary services including inbound and outbound transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, titling, administrative and collateral recovery services. ADESA also includes ADESA Remarketing Limited, an online whole car vehicle remarketing business in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 The IAA segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 175 salvage vehicle auction sites in the United States and Canada at December 31, 2017. IAA also includes HBC, which operates from 11 locations in the United Kingdom. The salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies, charity donation vehicles, recovered stolen (or theft) vehicles and low value used vehicles. The salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as inbound transportation, titling, salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services. Another important component of the IAA service offering is the ability to process large volumes of \ntotal loss vehicles in a short period of time following catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, hail storms, fires or other natural disasters.\n \u2022 The AFC segment provides short-term, inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers. At December 31, 2017, AFC conducted business at 128 locations in the United States and Canada. The Company also sells vehicle service contracts through Preferred Warranties, Inc. (\"PWI\").  The holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate offices, such as salaries, benefits and travel costs for our management team, certain human resources, information technology and accounting costs, and certain insurance, treasury, legal and risk management costs. Holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on capital leases and the corporate debt structure. Intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain administrative costs allocated by the holding company.\nIndustry Trends\nWhole Car\nUsed vehicles sold in North America through whole car auctions, including online only sales, were approximately 9.9 million, 10.6 million and an estimated 11.1 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We expect that used vehicle auction volumes in North America, including online only volumes, will be over 11 million units in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Our estimates are based on information from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, IHS Automotive, Kontos Total Market Estimates, NAAA's annual survey and management estimates.\nSalvage\nVehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry. The percentage of claims resulting in total losses was approximately 18% in 2017, 17% in 2016 and 16% in 2015. There is no central reporting system for the salvage vehicle auction industry that tracks the number of salvage vehicle auction volumes in any given year, which makes estimating industry volumes difficult. We believe that salvage auction industry volumes will grow 5% to 7% annually, for the foreseeable future.\nFluctuations in used vehicle and commodity pricing (aluminum, steel, etc.) have an impact on proceeds received in the salvage vehicle auction industry. In times of rising prices, revenue and gross profit are positively impacted. If used vehicle and commodity prices decrease, proceeds, revenue and gross profit at salvage auctions may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect the level of profitability. During 2017, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $156 to $188 and finished December 2017 at $170. For comparison, during 2016, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $109 to $188 and finished December 2016 at $136.\nAutomotive Finance\nAFC works with independent used vehicle dealers to improve their results by providing a comprehensive set of business and financial solutions that leverages its local branches, industry experience and scale, as well as KAR affiliations. AFC's North American dealer base has grown since 2009 from over 9,700 dealers to approximately 15,400 dealers in 2017 and loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, grew from approximately 800,000 in 2009 to approximately 1,700,000 in 2017. As a result of this increased activity and increases in new and used vehicle sales, AFC continues to experience increased competition.\nKey challenges for the independent used vehicle dealer include demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory, lack of access to consumer financing and increased competition resulting from consolidation in the used vehicle dealer industry. These same challenges, to the extent they occur, could result in a material negative impact on AFC's results of operations. A significant decline in used vehicle sales would result in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans. In addition, volatility in wholesale vehicle pricing impacts the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans and the resulting severity of credit losses at AFC.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.\nSources of Revenues and Expenses\nOur revenue is derived from auction fees and related services associated with our whole car and salvage auctions, and from dealer financing fees, interest income and other service revenue at AFC. Although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold.\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, the cost of vehicles purchased, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices. Cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.\nResults of Operations\nOverview of Results of KAR Auction Services, Inc. for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenue of $3,458.0 million compared with revenue of $3,150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 10%. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million or 3% of revenue. For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $24.0 million, or 10%, to $264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of certain assets placed in service over the last twelve months and depreciation and amortization for the assets of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $25.2 million, or 18%, to $164.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $273 million in the average outstanding balance of corporate debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as an increase in the weighted average interest rate for the same period of approximately 0.24%. In addition, there was an increase in interest expense at AFC of $9.5 million, which resulted from an increase in interest rates, increased borrowings and increased committed liquidity under the U.S. securitization agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $27.5 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and debt discounts associated with Term Loan B-2 and Term Loan B-3.\nIn March 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $4.0 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with Term Loan B-1 and unamortized debt issue costs associated with the 2014/2015 revolving credit facility. Additionally, in December 2016, we recorded a $1.4 million pretax charge primarily resulting from the write-off of a portion of unamortized securitization issuance costs associated with AFC's Receivables Purchase Agreement.\nGain on Previously Held Equity Interest Value\nIn October 2017, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in TradeRev and our previously held 50% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $21.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had an effective tax rate of 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an effective tax rate of 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $102.7 million relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and $11.1 million of expense associated with a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on the accumulated unrepatriated and untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that is payable over 8 years. We also recognized $6.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation as a discrete item in our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a reduction in income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nThe strengthening of the Canadian dollar has impacted the reporting of our Canadian operations in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2017, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate increased revenue by $7.6 million, operating profit by $2.7 million, net income by $1.6 million and net income per diluted share by $0.01.\nADESA Results\n\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from ADESA increased $172.2 million, or 10%, to $1,937.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 10%\nincrease in the number of vehicles sold (5% increase excluding acquisitions), partially offset by a less than 1% decrease in average revenue per vehicle sold as the mix of vehicles sold online increased as compared to the number of vehicles sold at physical auction. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million. Revenue increased $5.5 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nThe increase in vehicles sold was primarily attributable to a 15% increase in institutional volume (11% increase excluding acquisitions), including vehicles sold on our online only platform, as well as a 1% increase in dealer consignment units sold (7% decrease excluding acquisitions) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Online sales volume for ADESA represented approximately 45% of the total vehicles sold in 2017, compared with approximately 42% in 2016. \"Online sales\" includes the following: (i) selling vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); (ii) online solutions that offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); (iii) vehicles sold on the TradeRev platform; (iv) simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock\u00ae); and (v) bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock\u00ae). Upstream selling, midstream selling and TradeRev sales, which represent online only sales, accounted for approximately 66% of ADESA's online sales volume. ADESA sold approximately 938,000 and 743,000 vehicles (including 2% from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2017) through its online only offerings in 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which approximately 471,000 and 385,000 represented vehicle sales to grounding dealers in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dealer consignment vehicles represented approximately 45% of used vehicles sold at ADESA physical auction locations, compared with approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Vehicles sold at physical auction locations increased 5% (2% decrease excluding acquisitions) in 2017, compared with 2016. The used vehicle conversion percentage at North American physical auction locations, calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale at our ADESA auctions, increased to 60.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 58.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPhysical auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $22, or 3%, to $775 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $753 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold includes revenue from seller and buyer auction fees and ancillary and other related services, which includes non-auction services and excludes the sale of purchased vehicles. The increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold was primarily attributable to an increase in auction fees related to higher average transaction prices and lower margin ancillary and other related services revenue and an increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold of $2 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nOnline only auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $6 to $130 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $124 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold was attributable to an increase in purchased vehicles associated with the ADESA Assurance Program and the inclusion of TradeRev sales. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $113 and $110 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $3 increase in online only revenue per vehicle was attributable to increased revenue per vehicle for units sold on the TradeRev platform.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for ADESA increased $84.8 million, or 12%, to $813.6 million, compared with $728.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for ADESA was 42.0% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 41.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the increased mix of online only volume. Online only sales have a higher gross profit percentage than physical auction sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the ADESA segment increased $33.0 million, or 10%, to $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $327.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions of $27.7 million, compensation expense of $7.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million, information technology costs of $2.4 million, benefit-related expenses of $1.0 million, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate of $1.0 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $4.6 million, partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense of $4.5 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $4.4 million, marketing expenses of $2.5 million and professional fees of $2.0 million.\nIAA Results\n\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from IAA increased $121.2 million, or 11%, to $1,219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in vehicles sold of approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue per vehicle sold increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, and included an increase in revenue of $1.7 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate, partially offset by a decrease of $13.7 million from HBC and a decrease in revenue of $2.0 million due to fluctuations in the U.K. exchange rate. IAA's North American same-store total loss vehicle inventory increased approximately 3% at December 31, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, in part related to recent catastrophic events. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 5% and 7% of total salvage vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. North American online sales volumes for IAA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 60% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit at IAA increased to $441.1 million, or 36.2% of revenue, compared with $390.0 million, or 35.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to an 11% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 10% increase in cost of services, which included costs associated with purchase contract vehicles, costs incurred to store and process vehicles for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and organic volume growth.\nExcluding HBC, IAA's gross profit margin was 36.9% and 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, HBC had revenue of approximately $37.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively, and cost of services of approximately $32.2 million and $45.8 million, respectively, as fewer of HBC's vehicles were sold under purchase contracts. The entire selling price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchase contracts.\nIAA sold over 65,000 vehicles and recorded approximately $45.1 million of revenue and a $0.3 million gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to catastrophic events in Texas and Florida. Excluding these events (and HBC as noted above), IAA's gross profit margin was 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. IAA incurred significant costs in Texas and Florida in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Costs were incurred for real estate, security, lot operations and related support. These costs were incurred in advance of revenue. IAA recovered these excess costs incurred as vehicles were sold in 2017 and expects to recover the remainder of these excess costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at IAA increased $2.9 million, or 3%, to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $104.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense of $3.2 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, partially offset by decreases in employee related expenses of $1.5 million, bad debt expense of $0.9 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $1.3 million.\nAFC Results\n\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nFor the year ended", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Many of these risk factors are outside of our control, and as such, they involve risks which are not currently known that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied herein. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\nOur future growth depends on a variety of factors, including our ability to increase vehicle sold volumes and loan transaction volumes, expand our product and service offerings, including information systems development, acquire and integrate additional business entities, manage expansion, control costs in our operations, introduce fee increases, and retain our executive officers and key employees. We cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business.\nOverview\nWe provide whole car auction services and salvage auction services in North America and the United Kingdom. Our business is divided into three reportable business segments, each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry: ADESA Auctions, IAA and AFC.\n \u2022 The ADESA Auctions segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 75 whole car auction facilities in North America that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person. Through ADESA.com, powered by Openlane technology, ADESA offers comprehensive private label remarketing solutions to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies and other institutions to offer vehicles via the Internet prior to arrival at the physical auction. Vehicles at ADESA's auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators, financial institutions, rental car companies, new and used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchise and independent used vehicle dealers. ADESA also provides value-added ancillary services including inbound and outbound transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, titling, administrative and collateral recovery services. ADESA also includes ADESA Remarketing Limited, an online whole car vehicle remarketing business in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 The IAA segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through 175 salvage vehicle auction sites in the United States and Canada at December 31, 2017. IAA also includes HBC, which operates from 11 locations in the United Kingdom. The salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies, charity donation vehicles, recovered stolen (or theft) vehicles and low value used vehicles. The salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as inbound transportation, titling, salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services. Another important component of the IAA service offering is the ability to process large volumes of \ntotal loss vehicles in a short period of time following catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, hail storms, fires or other natural disasters.\n \u2022 The AFC segment provides short-term, inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers. At December 31, 2017, AFC conducted business at 128 locations in the United States and Canada. The Company also sells vehicle service contracts through Preferred Warranties, Inc. (\"PWI\").  The holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate offices, such as salaries, benefits and travel costs for our management team, certain human resources, information technology and accounting costs, and certain insurance, treasury, legal and risk management costs. Holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on capital leases and the corporate debt structure. Intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain administrative costs allocated by the holding company.\nIndustry Trends\nWhole Car\nUsed vehicles sold in North America through whole car auctions, including online only sales, were approximately 9.9 million, 10.6 million and an estimated 11.1 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We expect that used vehicle auction volumes in North America, including online only volumes, will be over 11 million units in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Our estimates are based on information from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, IHS Automotive, Kontos Total Market Estimates, NAAA's annual survey and management estimates.\nSalvage\nVehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry. The percentage of claims resulting in total losses was approximately 18% in 2017, 17% in 2016 and 16% in 2015. There is no central reporting system for the salvage vehicle auction industry that tracks the number of salvage vehicle auction volumes in any given year, which makes estimating industry volumes difficult. We believe that salvage auction industry volumes will grow 5% to 7% annually, for the foreseeable future.\nFluctuations in used vehicle and commodity pricing (aluminum, steel, etc.) have an impact on proceeds received in the salvage vehicle auction industry. In times of rising prices, revenue and gross profit are positively impacted. If used vehicle and commodity prices decrease, proceeds, revenue and gross profit at salvage auctions may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect the level of profitability. During 2017, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $156 to $188 and finished December 2017 at $170. For comparison, during 2016, the price per ton of crushed auto bodies in North America ranged from $109 to $188 and finished December 2016 at $136.\nAutomotive Finance\nAFC works with independent used vehicle dealers to improve their results by providing a comprehensive set of business and financial solutions that leverages its local branches, industry experience and scale, as well as KAR affiliations. AFC's North American dealer base has grown since 2009 from over 9,700 dealers to approximately 15,400 dealers in 2017 and loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, grew from approximately 800,000 in 2009 to approximately 1,700,000 in 2017. As a result of this increased activity and increases in new and used vehicle sales, AFC continues to experience increased competition.\nKey challenges for the independent used vehicle dealer include demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory, lack of access to consumer financing and increased competition resulting from consolidation in the used vehicle dealer industry. These same challenges, to the extent they occur, could result in a material negative impact on AFC's results of operations. A significant decline in used vehicle sales would result in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans. In addition, volatility in wholesale vehicle pricing impacts the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans and the resulting severity of credit losses at AFC.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.\nSources of Revenues and Expenses\nOur revenue is derived from auction fees and related services associated with our whole car and salvage auctions, and from dealer financing fees, interest income and other service revenue at AFC. Although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold.\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, the cost of vehicles purchased, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices. Cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.\nResults of Operations\nOverview of Results of KAR Auction Services, Inc. for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,765.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IAA\n</td> <td>1,219.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC\n</td> <td>301.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>3,458.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>1,987.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,827.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>1,470.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,322.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>640.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>583.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>566.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>164.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on previously held equity interest value\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>398.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenue of $3,458.0 million compared with revenue of $3,150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 10%. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million or 3% of revenue. For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $24.0 million, or 10%, to $264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of certain assets placed in service over the last twelve months and depreciation and amortization for the assets of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $25.2 million, or 18%, to $164.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $273 million in the average outstanding balance of corporate debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as an increase in the weighted average interest rate for the same period of approximately 0.24%. In addition, there was an increase in interest expense at AFC of $9.5 million, which resulted from an increase in interest rates, increased borrowings and increased committed liquidity under the U.S. securitization agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2017, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $27.5 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and debt discounts associated with Term Loan B-2 and Term Loan B-3.\nIn March 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement and recorded a $4.0 million pretax charge resulting from the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with Term Loan B-1 and unamortized debt issue costs associated with the 2014/2015 revolving credit facility. Additionally, in December 2016, we recorded a $1.4 million pretax charge primarily resulting from the write-off of a portion of unamortized securitization issuance costs associated with AFC's Receivables Purchase Agreement.\nGain on Previously Held Equity Interest Value\nIn October 2017, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in TradeRev and our previously held 50% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $21.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had an effective tax rate of 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an effective tax rate of 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $102.7 million relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and $11.1 million of expense associated with a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on the accumulated unrepatriated and untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that is payable over 8 years. We also recognized $6.4 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation as a discrete item in our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a reduction in income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nThe strengthening of the Canadian dollar has impacted the reporting of our Canadian operations in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2017, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate increased revenue by $7.6 million, operating profit by $2.7 million, net income by $1.6 million and net income per diluted share by $0.01.\nADESA Results\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions, except per vehicle amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADESA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,765.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>1,123.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,036.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>813.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>360.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>113.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>3,180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,885,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Physical auction vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,242,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,142,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Online only vehicles sold\n</td> <td>938,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Dealer consignment mix at physical auctions\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Conversion rate at North American physical auctions\n</td> <td>60.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold, excluding purchased vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online only revenue per vehicle sold, excluding ADESA Assurance Program vehicles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from ADESA increased $172.2 million, or 10%, to $1,937.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 10%\nincrease in the number of vehicles sold (5% increase excluding acquisitions), partially offset by a less than 1% decrease in average revenue per vehicle sold as the mix of vehicles sold online increased as compared to the number of vehicles sold at physical auction. Businesses acquired accounted for an increase in revenue of $89.6 million. Revenue increased $5.5 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nThe increase in vehicles sold was primarily attributable to a 15% increase in institutional volume (11% increase excluding acquisitions), including vehicles sold on our online only platform, as well as a 1% increase in dealer consignment units sold (7% decrease excluding acquisitions) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Online sales volume for ADESA represented approximately 45% of the total vehicles sold in 2017, compared with approximately 42% in 2016. \"Online sales\" includes the following: (i) selling vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); (ii) online solutions that offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); (iii) vehicles sold on the TradeRev platform; (iv) simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock\u00ae); and (v) bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock\u00ae). Upstream selling, midstream selling and TradeRev sales, which represent online only sales, accounted for approximately 66% of ADESA's online sales volume. ADESA sold approximately 938,000 and 743,000 vehicles (including 2% from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2017) through its online only offerings in 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which approximately 471,000 and 385,000 represented vehicle sales to grounding dealers in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, dealer consignment vehicles represented approximately 45% of used vehicles sold at ADESA physical auction locations, compared with approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Vehicles sold at physical auction locations increased 5% (2% decrease excluding acquisitions) in 2017, compared with 2016. The used vehicle conversion percentage at North American physical auction locations, calculated as the number of vehicles sold as a percentage of the number of vehicles entered for sale at our ADESA auctions, increased to 60.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 58.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPhysical auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $22, or 3%, to $775 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $753 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Physical auction revenue per vehicle sold includes revenue from seller and buyer auction fees and ancillary and other related services, which includes non-auction services and excludes the sale of purchased vehicles. The increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold was primarily attributable to an increase in auction fees related to higher average transaction prices and lower margin ancillary and other related services revenue and an increase in physical auction revenue per vehicle sold of $2 due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate.\nOnline only auction revenue per vehicle sold increased $6 to $130 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $124 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in online only auction revenue per vehicle sold was attributable to an increase in purchased vehicles associated with the ADESA Assurance Program and the inclusion of TradeRev sales. Excluding vehicles purchased as part of the ADESA Assurance Program, online only revenue per vehicle would have been $113 and $110 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $3 increase in online only revenue per vehicle was attributable to increased revenue per vehicle for units sold on the TradeRev platform.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit for ADESA increased $84.8 million, or 12%, to $813.6 million, compared with $728.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for ADESA was 42.0% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 41.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the increased mix of online only volume. Online only sales have a higher gross profit percentage than physical auction sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the ADESA segment increased $33.0 million, or 10%, to $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $327.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions of $27.7 million, compensation expense of $7.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million, information technology costs of $2.4 million, benefit-related expenses of $1.0 million, fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate of $1.0 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $4.6 million, partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense of $4.5 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $4.4 million, marketing expenses of $2.5 million and professional fees of $2.0 million.\nIAA Results\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IAA revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,219.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>778.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>441.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>107.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles sold\n</td> <td>2,369,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,184,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nRevenue from IAA increased $121.2 million, or 11%, to $1,219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in vehicles sold of approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue per vehicle sold increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, and included an increase in revenue of $1.7 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian exchange rate, partially offset by a decrease of $13.7 million from HBC and a decrease in revenue of $2.0 million due to fluctuations in the U.K. exchange rate. IAA's North American same-store total loss vehicle inventory increased approximately 3% at December 31, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, in part related to recent catastrophic events. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 5% and 7% of total salvage vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. North American online sales volumes for IAA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 60% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit at IAA increased to $441.1 million, or 36.2% of revenue, compared with $390.0 million, or 35.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to an 11% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 10% increase in cost of services, which included costs associated with purchase contract vehicles, costs incurred to store and process vehicles for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and organic volume growth.\nExcluding HBC, IAA's gross profit margin was 36.9% and 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, HBC had revenue of approximately $37.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively, and cost of services of approximately $32.2 million and $45.8 million, respectively, as fewer of HBC's vehicles were sold under purchase contracts. The entire selling price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchase contracts.\nIAA sold over 65,000 vehicles and recorded approximately $45.1 million of revenue and a $0.3 million gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to catastrophic events in Texas and Florida. Excluding these events (and HBC as noted above), IAA's gross profit margin was 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. IAA incurred significant costs in Texas and Florida in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Costs were incurred for real estate, security, lot operations and related support. These costs were incurred in advance of revenue. IAA recovered these excess costs incurred as vehicles were sold in 2017 and expects to recover the remainder of these excess costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at IAA increased $2.9 million, or 3%, to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $104.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense of $3.2 million, incentive-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, partially offset by decreases in employee related expenses of $1.5 million, bad debt expense of $0.9 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating $1.3 million.\nAFC Results\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions except volumes and per loan amounts)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFC revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>(33.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service revenue\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AFC revenue\n</td> <td>301.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services*\n</td> <td>85.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit*\n</td> <td>216.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan transactions\n</td> <td>1,688,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,718,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per loan transaction, excluding \"Other service revenue\"\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nRevenue\nFor the year ended"}
