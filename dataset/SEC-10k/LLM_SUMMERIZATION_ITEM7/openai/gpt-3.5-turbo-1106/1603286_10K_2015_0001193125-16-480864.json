Risk Factors.\nForward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. We caution the reader not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nPARTNERSHIP OVERVIEW\nWe are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed on March 11, 2014 by Dominion to initially own the Preferred Equity Interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, which owns LNG import, storage, regasification and transportation assets. We expect that our relationship with Dominion, which has substantial additional midstream assets, should provide us the opportunity over time to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Preferred Equity Interest is a perpetual, non-convertible preferred equity interest entitled to Preferred Return Distributions so long as Cove Point has sufficient cash and undistributed Net Operating Income (determined on a cumulative basis from the closing of the Offering) from which to make Preferred Return Distributions. Preferred Return Distributions will be made on a quarterly basis and will not be cumulative. The Preferred Equity Interest is also entitled to receive Additional Return Distributions, and should benefit from the expected increased cash flow and income associated with the Liquefaction Project upon completion. We expect the Preferred Equity Interest to have limited exposure to the capital expenditure requirements associated with the future expansion of the Cove Point Facilities, as Dominion, although it is under no obligation to do so, has indicated that it intends to provide such funding. Our results of operations and financial condition will be dependent on the performance of Cove Point, and we believe that the discussion and analysis of Cove Point's financial condition and operations is important to our unitholders.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all issued and outstanding membership interests in DCG. DCG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated open access, transportation-only interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia.\nOn September 29, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Iroquois, a Delaware limited partnership, owns and operates a 416-mile FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that extends from the Canada-U.S. border through the states of New York and Connecticut.\nBusiness Strategy\nDominion Midstream's primary business objective is to generate stable and growing cash flows, which will enable it to maintain\nand increase cash distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Pursue accretive acquisitions from Dominion. We intend to seek opportunities to expand our initial asset base primarily through accretive acquisitions from Dominion. In connection with the Offering, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its common equity interests in Cove Point, and we may also acquire newly issued common or additional preferred equity interests in Cove Point. Furthermore, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its indirect ownership interest in Blue Racer, which is a growing midstream company focused on the Utica Shale formation, and its indirect ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which is a newly created limited liability company focused on constructing a natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Dominion is under no obligation to sell these interests, nor are we obligated to purchase such interests. We believe Dominion will offer us opportunities to acquire other midstream assets that it may acquire or develop in the future or that it currently owns. We believe that Dominion's economic relationship with us incentivizes it to offer us acquisition opportunities, although it is under no obligation to do so nor are we obligated to make any such acquisitions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Pursue third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. We also intend to grow our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions from third parties and, as we acquire additional assets, future organic growth opportunities at those acquired assets.

Dominion Midstream utilized $340.9 million of net proceeds to make, through Cove Point Holdings, a contribution to Cove Point in exchange for the remaining portion of the Preferred Equity Interest.\nSee Note 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the significant contracts entered into in connection with the closing of the Offering.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe contribution by Dominion to Dominion Midstream of the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest. Dominion Midstream owns the general partner interest and controls Cove Point and therefore consolidates Cove Point. As such, Dominion Midstream's investment in the Preferred Equity Interest and Cove Point's preferred equity interest are eliminated in consolidation. Dominion's retained common equity interest in Cove Point is reflected as noncontrolling interest.\nThe DCG Acquisition is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis in DCG is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. On April 1, 2015, DCG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Midstream and is therefore consolidated by Dominion Midstream. The accompanying financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of DCG beginning January 31, 2015, the inception date of common control.\nFor the periods prior to the closing of the Offering on October 20, 2014, the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Cove Point, as our predecessor for accounting purposes. The financial statements were prepared using Dominion's historical basis in the assets and liabilities of Cove Point and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to Cove Point. For the period subsequent to the closing of the Offering, the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Dominion Midstream.\nThe financial statements for all years presented include costs for certain general, administrative and corporate expenses assigned by DRS or Dominion Payroll to Dominion Midstream and Cove Point on the basis of direct and allocated methods in accordance with Dominion Midstream's services agreements with DRS and Dominion Payroll and Cove Point's services agreement with DRS. Where costs incurred cannot be determined by specific identification, the costs are allocated based on the proportional level of effort devoted by DRS or Dominion Payroll resources that is attributable to the entities, determined by reference to\nnumber of employees, salaries and wages and other similar measures for the relevant DRS or Dominion Payroll department. Management believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses are reasonable. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Offering may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods presented, and may not reflect our actual results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods prior to the Offering.\nHOW WE EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream management uses a variety of financial metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and include: (1) EBITDA; (2) Adjusted EBITDA; and (3) distributable cash flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nEBITDA represents net income including noncontrolling interest and DCG Predecessor before interest and related charges, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA after adjustment for the EBITDA attributable to the DCG Predecessor and a noncontrolling interest in Cove Point held by Dominion subsequent to the Offering, less income from equity method investee, plus distributions from equity method investee. Subsequent to the DCG Acquisition in the second quarter of 2015, we define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, less interest expense and adjusted for known timing differences between cash and income. During the first quarter of 2015, the remaining net proceeds from the Offering were used to fund capital expenditures. As a result, the reconciliation of distributable cash flow no longer includes adjustments for expansion capital expenditures or the use of net proceeds from the Offering. All periods presented reflect the adjustments described above.\nAlthough we have not quantified Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for Cove Point as our Predecessor, we use these metrics to analyze our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and securities analysts, to assess:\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>The ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness, if any, and to make distributions; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Our operating performance and ROIC as compared to those of other publicly traded companies that own energy infrastructure assets, without regard to their financing methods and capital structure. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income, and the GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nand distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and operating income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period, or going forward, principally for the following reasons:\nAcquisition of Interest in Iroquois\nOn August 14, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into Contribution Agreements with NG and NJNR. On September 29, 2015, pursuant to the Contribution Agreements, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, consisting of NG's 20.4% and NJNR's 5.53% partnership interests in Iroquois and, in exchange, Dominion Midstream issued common units representing limited partnership interests in Dominion Midstream to both NG (6,783,373 common units) and NJNR (1,838,932 common units). The number of units was based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Dominion Midstream's common units for the five trading days prior to August 14, 2015, or $33.23 per unit. The acquisition of the 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois supports the expansion of Dominion Midstream's portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Iroquois investment, accounted for under the equity method, was recorded at $216.5 million based on the value of Dominion Midstream's common units at closing, including $0.5 million of external transaction costs.\nDCG Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into a Purchase, Sale and Contribution Agreement with Dominion pursuant to which Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DCG in exchange for total consideration of $500.8 million, as adjusted for working capital. The sale of DCG from Dominion to Dominion Midstream is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. Subsequent to the transaction, Dominion Midstream owns 100% of the membership interests in DCG and therefore consolidates DCG.\nImport Contracts\nCove Point has historically operated as an LNG import facility, under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments\ncreated the opportunity for Dominion to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, assuming it becomes operational, will extend the economic life of Cove Point. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Point's expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017.\nLiquefaction Project\nFollowing the completion and initial startup phase of the Liquefaction Project, we expect that Cove Point will be able to pay the Preferred Return Distributions using a small percentage of its total available cash flows, as we expect Cove Point's total annual revenues, including reservation charges on the Cove Point Pipeline, to increase substantially notwithstanding the expiration or termination of any existing contracts with its Import Shippers or Storage Customers.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal and state income taxes are reflected on the historical financial statements of Cove Point. Dominion Midstream, as a pass-through entity, generally is not subject to income taxes and does not record any provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes will not be included in future periods, except to the extent Dominion Midstream acquires interests in business activities that are conducted in states that impose income taxes on partnerships or if it were to acquire a controlling interest in an entity that is subject to income taxes. If, however, Dominion Midstream acquires a controlling interest in a business from Dominion that had previously been subject to income taxes, the income taxes incurred by the business would be included in Dominion Midstream's Consolidated Financial Statements for any period in which Dominion owned the controlling interest.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nSubsequent to the Offering, we have incurred incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a publicly traded partnership, such as expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting; tax return and Schedules K-1 preparation and distribution expenses; Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; expenses associated with listing on the NYSE; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; registrar and transfer agent fees; director and officer insurance expenses; and director compensation expenses. Additionally, our financial results reflect our obligation to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred and payments made on our behalf. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform various general, administrative and support services for us or on our behalf, and corporate overhead costs and expenses allocated to us by Dominion. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the costs and expenses that are allocable to us.\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDominion Midstream has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Midstream has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream is required to reflect the effect of FERC rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to FERC cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that FERC will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that would otherwise be expensed by nonregulated companies, are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that FERC will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by FERC.\nDominion Midstream evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by FERC or historical experience, as well as discussions with FERC and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nAt December 31, 2015, Dominion Midstream reported $295.5 million of goodwill on its Balance Sheet.\nIn April of each year, Dominion Midstream tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nIn general, Dominion Midstream estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion Midstream's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Midstream has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based\nthose estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. With the exception of the reporting unit containing goodwill associated with the DCG Acquisition as discussed below, if the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair value would have still been greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nIn connection with the DCG Acquisition, Dominion Midstream recorded $249.6 million of goodwill. As a result, a significant decrease in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit containing DCG to fall below its carrying value and could result in an assessment that the goodwill associated with that reporting unit is impaired. No such change has occurred in 2015.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new

Purchased gas expense includes the value of natural gas retained for use in routine operations and the cost of LNG cooling cargo purchases. Increases or decreases in purchased gas expenses are offset by corresponding increases or decreases in operating revenues and are thus financially neutral to Dominion Midstream. LNG cooling cargo purchases are required for Cove Point to maintain the cryogenic readiness of the Cove Point LNG Facility. Each year, one or two LNG cooling cargos are procured and billed to the Import Shippers pursuant to certain provisions in Cove Point's FERC gas tariff.\nAn analysis of Dominion Midstream's results of operations follows:\n2015 VS. 2014\nNet revenue increased 24% primarily related to increased transportation and storage revenue as a result of the DCG Acquisition ($61.5 million). Additionally, operating revenue and purchased gas expense decreased approximately $5.0 million primarily due to pricing declines at Cove Point's transportation and storage operations, including pricing declines related to LNG cooling cargo during 2015 ($20.6 million), partially offset by an increase of $21.0 million from the receipt of two LNG cooling cargoes during 2015 as compared to one LNG cooling cargo during 2014.\nOther operations and maintenance increased 62% primarily due to the DCG Acquisition ($22.8 million), an increase in corporate general and administrative costs associated with operating as a stand-alone publicly traded partnership for the entire year ($2.0 million) and certain transition service costs associated with the DCG Acquisition ($3.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in stakeholder outreach expenditures associated with the Liquefaction Project.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 7% primarily due to the DCG Acquisition ($7.5 million), partially offset by the absence of accelerated depreciation recorded in 2014 for 2015 asset retirements associated with the Liquefaction Project ($4.8 million).\nEarnings for equity method investee increased $6.6 million as a result of the acquisition of a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois.\nOther taxes increased 17% primarily due to the DCG Acquisition.\nInterest and related charges increased $0.6 million as a result of the issuance of affiliated long-term debt in connection with the DCG Acquisition.\nIncome tax expense decreased $51.8 million as a result of Dominion Midstream's treatment as a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes effective October 20, 2014, partially offset by $2.1 million of income taxes attributable to the DCG Predecessor.\n2014 VS. 2013\nNet revenue increased 1%, primarily reflecting a $3.2 million increase in other revenue as a result of the renegotiation of certain import-related contracts. Operating revenue and purchased gas expense decreased as Cove Point received one LNG cooling cargo in 2014 compared to the receipt of two LNG cooling cargos in 2013.\nOther operations and maintenance increased 25%, primarily due to an increase in stakeholder outreach expenditures associated with the Liquefaction Project.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 19%, primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation from anticipated asset retirements associated with the Liquefaction Project.\nOther taxes increased 6% primarily due to an increase of $0.5 million in assessed property taxes on the Cove Point LNG Facility and the absence of a $0.5 million reduction of property taxes recognized in 2013 to reflect the actual amount billed to Cove Point.\nInterest and related charges were immaterial in both 2014 and 2013 as any affiliated borrowings were used primarily to fund capital expenditures and therefore associated interest and related charges were capitalized to property, plant and equipment.\nIncome tax expense decreased 16% primarily reflecting a $10.0 million decrease as a result of our treatment as a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes effective October 20, 2014, and a $4.8 million decrease due to a decline in net income prior to October 20, 2014 as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of a $3.6 million prior year benefit resulting from a change in the allocation of Cove Point's income to states.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPresented below is a summary of contributions by Dominion Midstream's operating segments to net income including noncontrolling interest and DGG Predecessor:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dominion Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Dominion Energy\nPresented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Energy's contribution to net income including noncontrolling interest and DCG Predecessor.

See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items in more detail.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nDominion Midstream's ongoing principal sources of liquidity may include distributions received from Cove Point from our Preferred Equity Interest, cash generated from operations of DCG, distributions received from our noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, borrowings under our credit facility with Dominion and issuances of debt and equity securities. We believe that cash from these sources will be sufficient to pay distributions while continuing to meet our short-term working capital requirements and our long-term capital expenditure requirements.\nWe expect to have sufficient distributable cash flow to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.1750 per common unit and subordinated unit, which equates to $13.6 million per quarter, or $54.4 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common units and subordinated units currently outstanding. However, we do not have a legal or contractual obligation to pay distributions quarterly or on any other basis or at the minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate, and\nthere is no guarantee that we will pay distributions to our unitholders in any quarter.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nIn connection with the Offering, Dominion Midstream entered into a $300 million credit facility with Dominion, allowing it to competitively pursue acquisitions and future organic growth opportunities or to otherwise meet its financial needs. In June 2015, we borrowed $5.9 million against the credit facility to fund expansion capital expenditures. In January 2016, we borrowed an additional $4.8 million against the credit facility to fund property tax payments, of which $1.2 million was repaid in February 2016. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of certain key terms of the credit facility with Dominion.\nOn April 1, 2015, in connection with the DCG Acquisition, Dominion Midstream issued a two-year, $300.8 million senior unsecured promissory note payable to Dominion, as adjusted for working capital, at an annual interest rate of 0.6%. Interest on the note is payable quarterly, and all principal and accrued interest is due and payable at maturity on April 1, 2017, which under certain conditions can be extended at the option of Dominion Midstream to October 1, 2017.\nCapital Requirements\nCAPITAL SPENDING\nOur operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, maintain or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. As defined in our partnership agreement, our capital requirements consist of:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Maintenance capital expenditures used to maintain the long-term operating capacity and operating income of our pipelines and facilities. Examples include expenditures to refurbish and replace pipelines, terminals and storage facilities, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Expansion capital expenditures used to increase our operating capacity or operating income over the long term. Examples include the acquisition of equipment, the development of a new facility or the expansion of an existing facility. </td> </tr>\n</table> For the year ended December 31, 2015, Dominion Midstream paid total capital expenditures of $1.3 billion (of which $2.4 million relates to DCG Predecessor and was funded by Dominion), which included $24.4 million of maintenance capital expenditures.\nOur significant capital projects, all of which are expansion projects, are described further below:\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total costs of developing the Liquefaction Project are estimated to be $3.4 billion to $3.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Through December 31, 2015, Cove Point incurred approximately $2.2 billion of development and construction costs associated with the Liquefaction Project. We caused Cove Point to use the net proceeds contributed to it from the Offering to fund a portion of development and construction costs associated with the Liquefaction Project. The Liquefaction Project is expected to be placed into service in late 2017. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Total costs of the St. Charles Transportation Project and Keys Energy Project are estimated to be approximately $30 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> and $40 million, respectively.

In July 2015, DCG requested authorization to utilize the FERC pre-filing process. DCG expects to file the application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities in the first quarter of 2016. The project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. </td> </tr>\n</table> Dominion has indicated that it intends to provide the funding necessary for the remaining construction costs and other capital expenditures of Cove Point, including the Liquefaction Project, St. Charles Transportation Project and Keys Energy Project, but it is under no contractual obligation to do so and has not secured all of the funding necessary to cover these costs, as it intends to finance these costs as they are incurred using its consolidated operating cash flows in addition to proceeds from capital markets transactions. However, Dominion has entered into guarantee arrangements on behalf of Cove Point to facilitate the Liquefaction Project, including guarantees supporting the terminal services and transportation agreements as well as the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the Liquefaction Project. Two of the guarantees have no stated limit, one guarantee has a $150 million limit and one guarantee has a $1.75 billion aggregate limit with an annual draw limit of $175 million. In the event that Dominion does not satisfy its obligations under these guarantee arrangements or otherwise does not agree to provide the funding necessary for the remaining development costs and other capital expenditures of Cove Point, or is unable to obtain such funding in the amounts required or on terms acceptable to Dominion, Cove Point would require substantial external debt or equity financing to complete the construction of the Liquefaction Project, St. Charles Transportation Project and Keys Energy Project.\nDistributions\nDistributions are declared subsequent to quarter end.

OPERATING CASH FLOWS\nIn 2015, net cash provided by Dominion Midstream's operating activities increased by $87.4 million primarily due to the absence of federal and state income taxes subsequent to the Offering as well as net changes in working capital items and the DCG Acquisition.\nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nIn 2015, net cash used in Dominion Midstream's investing activities increased by $711.1 million, primarily due to higher capital expenditures for the Liquefaction Project.\nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nIn 2015, net cash provided by Dominion Midstream's financing activities increased by $319.1 million, primarily due to higher capital contributions from Dominion to fund the Liquefaction Project, partially offset by the absence of proceeds from the Offering.\nCUSTOMER CONCENTRATION\nDominion Midstream provides service to approximately seventy customers, including the Storage Customers, marketers or end users, power generators, utilities and the Import Shippers. The two largest customers comprised approximately 71% of the total\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\ntransportation and storage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nDominion Midstream is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include contracts for capital projects and the purchase of goods and services. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts of which Dominion Midstream or its subsidiaries is party as of December 31, 2015. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below.

Business and Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Acquisition\nIn February 2016, Dominion announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Questar Corporation to acquire its outstanding common stock for approximately $4.4 billion in cash as well as the assumption of Questar Corporation's outstanding debt. Upon closing of the transaction, Questar Corporation will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion. Subject to receipt of Questar Corporation shareholder and any required regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions, Dominion targets closing by the end of 2016. Dominion announced its intended financing of the transaction would include an issuance of common units at Dominion Midstream in exchange for certain assets of Questar Corporation which are expected to be contributed to Dominion Midstream. We expect any future contributions to Dominion Midstream, subject to approval by the boards of Dominion and Dominion Midstream, to be submitted for approval by the Conflicts Committee.\nEnvironmental Matters\nDominion Midstream is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MONITORING EXPENDITURES\nExpenses (including depreciation) related to environmental protection and monitoring activities were $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These expenses are expected to approximate $1.1 million in both 2016 and 2017. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $0.2 million, $3.7 million, and $5.9 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These expenditures are expected to approximate $0.2 million in both 2016 and 2017.\nFUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\nAir\nThe CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation's air quality. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Dominion Midstream's facilities are subject to the CAA's permitting and other requirements.\nIn January 2015, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA announced plans to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector including natural gas processing and transmission sources. In July 2015, the EPA announced the next generation of its voluntary Natural Gas STAR program, the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. The proposed program covers the entire natural gas sector from production to distribution, with more emphasis on transparency and increased reporting for both annual emissions and reductions achieved through implementation measures. Until these regulations and guidelines are finalized, we are unable to predict future requirements or estimate compliance costs with certainty.\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule tightening the ozone standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. The EPA is expected to complete attainment designations for a new standard by December 2017 and states will have until 2020 or 2021 to develop plans to address the new standard. The Cove Point Facilities and two compressor stations (one electric) in northern Virginia are located in areas that are designated nonattainment under the previous standard and are expected to retain nonattainment status under the new, more stringent standard. The rule is not expected to result in nonattainment status for any areas where DCG operates. Until the states have developed implementation plans, Dominion Midstream is unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls.\nIn August 2015, the EPA issued final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants. Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The new rule requires states to meet state-by-state emission rate or intensity-based CO2 binding goals or limits. States are required to submit interim plans to the EPA by summer 2016 identifying how they will comply with the rule, with final plans due by September 2018. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dominion Midstream cannot predict the impact of this rule on its financial performance at this time.\nIn September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed NSPS to regulate methane and VOC emissions from transportation and storage, gathering and boosting, production and processing facilities. All projects which commence construction after September 2015 will be required to comply with this regulation. Dominion Midstream is currently evaluating the proposed regulation and cannot predict future requirements or estimate compliance costs.\nLegal Matters\nIn January 2015, DCG, while it was a subsidiary of SCANA, self-reported potentially non-compliant natural gas pipeline exposure maintenance activities to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During pipeline maintenance activities, it was discovered that prior authorization had not been obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for seventeen locations that involved the additions of fill, culverts and concrete mats. In June 2015, DCG submitted a draft CRA to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with proposed plans for rehabilitation and minimization of potential adverse impacts to water bodies and proposed to apply for after-the-fact permits. Dominion Midstream expects SCANA will provide funding for all material costs, if any, to satisfy the requirements imposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by the CRA.", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive overview of Dominion Midstream's financial condition and operations.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nPARTNERSHIP OVERVIEW\nWe are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed on March 11, 2014 by Dominion to initially own the Preferred Equity Interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, which owns LNG import, storage, regasification and transportation assets. We expect that our relationship with Dominion, which has substantial additional midstream assets, should provide us the opportunity over time to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Preferred Equity Interest is a perpetual, non-convertible preferred equity interest entitled to Preferred Return Distributions so long as Cove Point has sufficient cash and undistributed Net Operating Income (determined on a cumulative basis from the closing of the Offering) from which to make Preferred Return Distributions. Preferred Return Distributions will be made on a quarterly basis and will not be cumulative. The Preferred Equity Interest is also entitled to receive Additional Return Distributions, and should benefit from the expected increased cash flow and income associated with the Liquefaction Project upon completion. We expect the Preferred Equity Interest to have limited exposure to the capital expenditure requirements associated with the future expansion of the Cove Point Facilities, as Dominion, although it is under no obligation to do so, has indicated that it intends to provide such funding. Our results of operations and financial condition will be dependent on the performance of Cove Point, and we believe that the discussion and analysis of Cove Point's financial condition and operations is important to our unitholders.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all issued and outstanding membership interests in DCG. DCG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated open access, transportation-only interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia.\nOn September 29, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Iroquois, a Delaware limited partnership, owns and operates a 416-mile FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that extends from the Canada-U.S. border through the states of New York and Connecticut.\nBusiness Strategy\nDominion Midstream's primary business objective is to generate stable and growing cash flows, which will enable it to maintain\nand increase cash distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:\n \u2022 Pursue accretive acquisitions from Dominion. We intend to seek opportunities to expand our initial asset base primarily through accretive acquisitions from Dominion. In connection with the Offering, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its common equity interests in Cove Point, and we may also acquire newly issued common or additional preferred equity interests in Cove Point. Furthermore, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its indirect ownership interest in Blue Racer, which is a growing midstream company focused on the Utica Shale formation, and its indirect ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which is a newly created limited liability company focused on constructing a natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Dominion is under no obligation to sell these interests, nor are we obligated to purchase such interests. We believe Dominion will offer us opportunities to acquire other midstream assets that it may acquire or develop in the future or that it currently owns. We believe that Dominion's economic relationship with us incentivizes it to offer us acquisition opportunities, although it is under no obligation to do so nor are we obligated to make any such acquisitions. \n \u2022 Pursue third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. We also intend to grow our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions from third parties and, as we acquire additional assets, future organic growth opportunities at those acquired assets. Our third-party growth strategy will include assets both within the existing geographic footprint of Dominion's natural gas-related businesses and potentially in new areas. \n \u2022 Focus on long-term stable cash flows. We intend to pursue future growth opportunities, whether through our relationship with Dominion, third-party acquisitions or organic growth opportunities, that provide long-term, stable cash flows. \n \u2022 Capitalize on Dominion's midstream experience in the Utica and Marcellus Shale formations. We intend to capitalize on Dominion's midstream experience in the high growth areas of the Utica and Marcellus Shale formations. Dominion's experience in these shale formations, as well as its extensive footprint, could potentially provide significant growth opportunities. \nINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\nOn October 15, 2014, Dominion Midstream's common units began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \u201cDM.\u201d On October 20, 2014, Dominion Midstream closed the Offering of 20,125,000 common units to the public at a price of $21.00 per common unit, which included a 2,625,000 common unit over-allotment option that was exercised in full by the underwriters.\nIn exchange for Dominion's contribution of the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest to us, which we contributed to Cove Point Holdings, Dominion received:\n \u2022 11,847,789 common units and 31,972,789 subordinated units, representing an aggregate 68.5% limited partner interest; \n \u2022 All of our IDRs; \n 35 \n \u2022 A non-economic general partner interest; and \n \u2022 A cash distribution of $51.5 million as described in the partnership agreement.  Dominion Midstream received net proceeds of $392.4 million from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring fees and offering expenses of $30.2 million. Dominion Midstream utilized $340.9 million of net proceeds to make, through Cove Point Holdings, a contribution to Cove Point in exchange for the remaining portion of the Preferred Equity Interest.\nSee Note 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the significant contracts entered into in connection with the closing of the Offering.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe contribution by Dominion to Dominion Midstream of the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest. Dominion Midstream owns the general partner interest and controls Cove Point and therefore consolidates Cove Point. As such, Dominion Midstream's investment in the Preferred Equity Interest and Cove Point's preferred equity interest are eliminated in consolidation. Dominion's retained common equity interest in Cove Point is reflected as noncontrolling interest.\nThe DCG Acquisition is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis in DCG is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. On April 1, 2015, DCG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Midstream and is therefore consolidated by Dominion Midstream. The accompanying financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of DCG beginning January 31, 2015, the inception date of common control.\nFor the periods prior to the closing of the Offering on October 20, 2014, the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Cove Point, as our predecessor for accounting purposes. The financial statements were prepared using Dominion's historical basis in the assets and liabilities of Cove Point and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to Cove Point. For the period subsequent to the closing of the Offering, the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Dominion Midstream.\nThe financial statements for all years presented include costs for certain general, administrative and corporate expenses assigned by DRS or Dominion Payroll to Dominion Midstream and Cove Point on the basis of direct and allocated methods in accordance with Dominion Midstream's services agreements with DRS and Dominion Payroll and Cove Point's services agreement with DRS. Where costs incurred cannot be determined by specific identification, the costs are allocated based on the proportional level of effort devoted by DRS or Dominion Payroll resources that is attributable to the entities, determined by reference to\nnumber of employees, salaries and wages and other similar measures for the relevant DRS or Dominion Payroll department. Management believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses are reasonable. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Offering may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods presented, and may not reflect our actual results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods prior to the Offering.\nHOW WE EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream management uses a variety of financial metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and include: (1) EBITDA; (2) Adjusted EBITDA; and (3) distributable cash flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nEBITDA represents net income including noncontrolling interest and DCG Predecessor before interest and related charges, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA after adjustment for the EBITDA attributable to the DCG Predecessor and a noncontrolling interest in Cove Point held by Dominion subsequent to the Offering, less income from equity method investee, plus distributions from equity method investee. Subsequent to the DCG Acquisition in the second quarter of 2015, we define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, less interest expense and adjusted for known timing differences between cash and income. During the first quarter of 2015, the remaining net proceeds from the Offering were used to fund capital expenditures. As a result, the reconciliation of distributable cash flow no longer includes adjustments for expansion capital expenditures or the use of net proceeds from the Offering. All periods presented reflect the adjustments described above.\nAlthough we have not quantified Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for Cove Point as our Predecessor, we use these metrics to analyze our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and securities analysts, to assess:\n \u2022 The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 The ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness, if any, and to make distributions; and \n \u2022 Our operating performance and ROIC as compared to those of other publicly traded companies that own energy infrastructure assets, without regard to their financing methods and capital structure. \nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income, and the GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\n 36 \nand distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and operating income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period, or going forward, principally for the following reasons:\nAcquisition of Interest in Iroquois\nOn August 14, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into Contribution Agreements with NG and NJNR. On September 29, 2015, pursuant to the Contribution Agreements, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, consisting of NG's 20.4% and NJNR's 5.53% partnership interests in Iroquois and, in exchange, Dominion Midstream issued common units representing limited partnership interests in Dominion Midstream to both NG (6,783,373 common units) and NJNR (1,838,932 common units). The number of units was based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Dominion Midstream's common units for the five trading days prior to August 14, 2015, or $33.23 per unit. The acquisition of the 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois supports the expansion of Dominion Midstream's portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Iroquois investment, accounted for under the equity method, was recorded at $216.5 million based on the value of Dominion Midstream's common units at closing, including $0.5 million of external transaction costs.\nDCG Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into a Purchase, Sale and Contribution Agreement with Dominion pursuant to which Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DCG in exchange for total consideration of $500.8 million, as adjusted for working capital. The sale of DCG from Dominion to Dominion Midstream is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. Subsequent to the transaction, Dominion Midstream owns 100% of the membership interests in DCG and therefore consolidates DCG.\nImport Contracts\nCove Point has historically operated as an LNG import facility, under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments\ncreated the opportunity for Dominion to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, assuming it becomes operational, will extend the economic life of Cove Point. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Point's expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017.\nLiquefaction Project\nFollowing the completion and initial startup phase of the Liquefaction Project, we expect that Cove Point will be able to pay the Preferred Return Distributions using a small percentage of its total available cash flows, as we expect Cove Point's total annual revenues, including reservation charges on the Cove Point Pipeline, to increase substantially notwithstanding the expiration or termination of any existing contracts with its Import Shippers or Storage Customers.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal and state income taxes are reflected on the historical financial statements of Cove Point. Dominion Midstream, as a pass-through entity, generally is not subject to income taxes and does not record any provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes will not be included in future periods, except to the extent Dominion Midstream acquires interests in business activities that are conducted in states that impose income taxes on partnerships or if it were to acquire a controlling interest in an entity that is subject to income taxes. If, however, Dominion Midstream acquires a controlling interest in a business from Dominion that had previously been subject to income taxes, the income taxes incurred by the business would be included in Dominion Midstream's Consolidated Financial Statements for any period in which Dominion owned the controlling interest.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nSubsequent to the Offering, we have incurred incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a publicly traded partnership, such as expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting; tax return and Schedules K-1 preparation and distribution expenses; Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; expenses associated with listing on the NYSE; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; registrar and transfer agent fees; director and officer insurance expenses; and director compensation expenses. Additionally, our financial results reflect our obligation to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred and payments made on our behalf. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform various general, administrative and support services for us or on our behalf, and corporate overhead costs and expenses allocated to us by Dominion. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the costs and expenses that are allocable to us.\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDominion Midstream has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of\n 37 \nthe judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Midstream has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream is required to reflect the effect of FERC rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to FERC cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that FERC will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that would otherwise be expensed by nonregulated companies, are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that FERC will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by FERC.\nDominion Midstream evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by FERC or historical experience, as well as discussions with FERC and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nAt December 31, 2015, Dominion Midstream reported $295.5 million of goodwill on its Balance Sheet.\nIn April of each year, Dominion Midstream tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nIn general, Dominion Midstream estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion Midstream's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Midstream has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based\nthose estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. With the exception of the reporting unit containing goodwill associated with the DCG Acquisition as discussed below, if the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair value would have still been greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nIn connection with the DCG Acquisition, Dominion Midstream recorded $249.6 million of goodwill. As a result, a significant decrease in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit containing DCG to fall below its carrying value and could result in an assessment that the goodwill associated with that reporting unit is impaired. No such change has occurred in 2015.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nPARTNERSHIP OVERVIEW\nWe are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed on March 11, 2014 by Dominion to initially own the Preferred Equity Interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, which owns LNG import, storage, regasification and transportation assets. We expect that our relationship with Dominion, which has substantial additional midstream assets, should provide us the opportunity over time to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Preferred Equity Interest is a perpetual, non-convertible preferred equity interest entitled to Preferred Return Distributions so long as Cove Point has sufficient cash and undistributed Net Operating Income (determined on a cumulative basis from the closing of the Offering) from which to make Preferred Return Distributions. Preferred Return Distributions will be made on a quarterly basis and will not be cumulative. The Preferred Equity Interest is also entitled to receive Additional Return Distributions, and should benefit from the expected increased cash flow and income associated with the Liquefaction Project upon completion. We expect the Preferred Equity Interest to have limited exposure to the capital expenditure requirements associated with the future expansion of the Cove Point Facilities, as Dominion, although it is under no obligation to do so, has indicated that it intends to provide such funding. Our results of operations and financial condition will be dependent on the performance of Cove Point, and we believe that the discussion and analysis of Cove Point's financial condition and operations is important to our unitholders.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all issued and outstanding membership interests in DCG. DCG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated open access, transportation-only interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia.\nOn September 29, 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Iroquois, a Delaware limited partnership, owns and operates a 416-mile FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that extends from the Canada-U.S. border through the states of New York and Connecticut.\nBusiness Strategy\nDominion Midstream's primary business objective is to generate stable and growing cash flows, which will enable it to maintain\nand increase cash distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:\n \u2022 Pursue accretive acquisitions from Dominion. We intend to seek opportunities to expand our initial asset base primarily through accretive acquisitions from Dominion. In connection with the Offering, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its common equity interests in Cove Point, and we may also acquire newly issued common or additional preferred equity interests in Cove Point. Furthermore, Dominion granted us a right of first offer with respect to any future sale of its indirect ownership interest in Blue Racer, which is a growing midstream company focused on the Utica Shale formation, and its indirect ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which is a newly created limited liability company focused on constructing a natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Dominion is under no obligation to sell these interests, nor are we obligated to purchase such interests. We believe Dominion will offer us opportunities to acquire other midstream assets that it may acquire or develop in the future or that it currently owns. We believe that Dominion's economic relationship with us incentivizes it to offer us acquisition opportunities, although it is under no obligation to do so nor are we obligated to make any such acquisitions. \n \u2022 Pursue third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. We also intend to grow our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions from third parties and, as we acquire additional assets, future organic growth opportunities at those acquired assets. Our third-party growth strategy will include assets both within the existing geographic footprint of Dominion's natural gas-related businesses and potentially in new areas. \n \u2022 Focus on long-term stable cash flows. We intend to pursue future growth opportunities, whether through our relationship with Dominion, third-party acquisitions or organic growth opportunities, that provide long-term, stable cash flows. \n \u2022 Capitalize on Dominion's midstream experience in the Utica and Marcellus Shale formations. We intend to capitalize on Dominion's midstream experience in the high growth areas of the Utica and Marcellus Shale formations. Dominion's experience in these shale formations, as well as its extensive footprint, could potentially provide significant growth opportunities. \nINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\nOn October 15, 2014, Dominion Midstream's common units began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \u201cDM.\u201d On October 20, 2014, Dominion Midstream closed the Offering of 20,125,000 common units to the public at a price of $21.00 per common unit, which included a 2,625,000 common unit over-allotment option that was exercised in full by the underwriters.\nIn exchange for Dominion's contribution of the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest to us, which we contributed to Cove Point Holdings, Dominion received:\n \u2022 11,847,789 common units and 31,972,789 subordinated units, representing an aggregate 68.5% limited partner interest; \n \u2022 All of our IDRs; \n 35 \n \u2022 A non-economic general partner interest; and \n \u2022 A cash distribution of $51.5 million as described in the partnership agreement.  Dominion Midstream received net proceeds of $392.4 million from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring fees and offering expenses of $30.2 million. Dominion Midstream utilized $340.9 million of net proceeds to make, through Cove Point Holdings, a contribution to Cove Point in exchange for the remaining portion of the Preferred Equity Interest.\nSee Note 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the significant contracts entered into in connection with the closing of the Offering.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe contribution by Dominion to Dominion Midstream of the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the general partner interest in Cove Point and a portion of the Preferred Equity Interest. Dominion Midstream owns the general partner interest and controls Cove Point and therefore consolidates Cove Point. As such, Dominion Midstream's investment in the Preferred Equity Interest and Cove Point's preferred equity interest are eliminated in consolidation. Dominion's retained common equity interest in Cove Point is reflected as noncontrolling interest.\nThe DCG Acquisition is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis in DCG is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. On April 1, 2015, DCG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Midstream and is therefore consolidated by Dominion Midstream. The accompanying financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of DCG beginning January 31, 2015, the inception date of common control.\nFor the periods prior to the closing of the Offering on October 20, 2014, the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Cove Point, as our predecessor for accounting purposes. The financial statements were prepared using Dominion's historical basis in the assets and liabilities of Cove Point and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to Cove Point. For the period subsequent to the closing of the Offering, the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Dominion Midstream.\nThe financial statements for all years presented include costs for certain general, administrative and corporate expenses assigned by DRS or Dominion Payroll to Dominion Midstream and Cove Point on the basis of direct and allocated methods in accordance with Dominion Midstream's services agreements with DRS and Dominion Payroll and Cove Point's services agreement with DRS. Where costs incurred cannot be determined by specific identification, the costs are allocated based on the proportional level of effort devoted by DRS or Dominion Payroll resources that is attributable to the entities, determined by reference to\nnumber of employees, salaries and wages and other similar measures for the relevant DRS or Dominion Payroll department. Management believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses are reasonable. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Offering may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods presented, and may not reflect our actual results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone publicly traded partnership during the periods prior to the Offering.\nHOW WE EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream management uses a variety of financial metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and include: (1) EBITDA; (2) Adjusted EBITDA; and (3) distributable cash flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nEBITDA represents net income including noncontrolling interest and DCG Predecessor before interest and related charges, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA after adjustment for the EBITDA attributable to the DCG Predecessor and a noncontrolling interest in Cove Point held by Dominion subsequent to the Offering, less income from equity method investee, plus distributions from equity method investee. Subsequent to the DCG Acquisition in the second quarter of 2015, we define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, less interest expense and adjusted for known timing differences between cash and income. During the first quarter of 2015, the remaining net proceeds from the Offering were used to fund capital expenditures. As a result, the reconciliation of distributable cash flow no longer includes adjustments for expansion capital expenditures or the use of net proceeds from the Offering. All periods presented reflect the adjustments described above.\nAlthough we have not quantified Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for Cove Point as our Predecessor, we use these metrics to analyze our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and securities analysts, to assess:\n \u2022 The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 The ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness, if any, and to make distributions; and \n \u2022 Our operating performance and ROIC as compared to those of other publicly traded companies that own energy infrastructure assets, without regard to their financing methods and capital structure. \nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income, and the GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\n 36 \nand distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and operating income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period, or going forward, principally for the following reasons:\nAcquisition of Interest in Iroquois\nOn August 14, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into Contribution Agreements with NG and NJNR. On September 29, 2015, pursuant to the Contribution Agreements, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, consisting of NG's 20.4% and NJNR's 5.53% partnership interests in Iroquois and, in exchange, Dominion Midstream issued common units representing limited partnership interests in Dominion Midstream to both NG (6,783,373 common units) and NJNR (1,838,932 common units). The number of units was based on the volume-weighted average trading price of Dominion Midstream's common units for the five trading days prior to August 14, 2015, or $33.23 per unit. The acquisition of the 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois supports the expansion of Dominion Midstream's portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. The Iroquois investment, accounted for under the equity method, was recorded at $216.5 million based on the value of Dominion Midstream's common units at closing, including $0.5 million of external transaction costs.\nDCG Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, Dominion Midstream entered into a Purchase, Sale and Contribution Agreement with Dominion pursuant to which Dominion Midstream acquired from Dominion all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DCG in exchange for total consideration of $500.8 million, as adjusted for working capital. The sale of DCG from Dominion to Dominion Midstream is considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a result, Dominion Midstream's basis is equal to Dominion's cost basis in the assets and liabilities of DCG. Subsequent to the transaction, Dominion Midstream owns 100% of the membership interests in DCG and therefore consolidates DCG.\nImport Contracts\nCove Point has historically operated as an LNG import facility, under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments\ncreated the opportunity for Dominion to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, assuming it becomes operational, will extend the economic life of Cove Point. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Point's expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017.\nLiquefaction Project\nFollowing the completion and initial startup phase of the Liquefaction Project, we expect that Cove Point will be able to pay the Preferred Return Distributions using a small percentage of its total available cash flows, as we expect Cove Point's total annual revenues, including reservation charges on the Cove Point Pipeline, to increase substantially notwithstanding the expiration or termination of any existing contracts with its Import Shippers or Storage Customers.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal and state income taxes are reflected on the historical financial statements of Cove Point. Dominion Midstream, as a pass-through entity, generally is not subject to income taxes and does not record any provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes will not be included in future periods, except to the extent Dominion Midstream acquires interests in business activities that are conducted in states that impose income taxes on partnerships or if it were to acquire a controlling interest in an entity that is subject to income taxes. If, however, Dominion Midstream acquires a controlling interest in a business from Dominion that had previously been subject to income taxes, the income taxes incurred by the business would be included in Dominion Midstream's Consolidated Financial Statements for any period in which Dominion owned the controlling interest.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nSubsequent to the Offering, we have incurred incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a publicly traded partnership, such as expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting; tax return and Schedules K-1 preparation and distribution expenses; Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; expenses associated with listing on the NYSE; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; registrar and transfer agent fees; director and officer insurance expenses; and director compensation expenses. Additionally, our financial results reflect our obligation to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred and payments made on our behalf. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform various general, administrative and support services for us or on our behalf, and corporate overhead costs and expenses allocated to us by Dominion. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the costs and expenses that are allocable to us.\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDominion Midstream has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of\n 37 \nthe judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Midstream has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nDominion Midstream is required to reflect the effect of FERC rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to FERC cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that FERC will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that would otherwise be expensed by nonregulated companies, are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that FERC will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by FERC.\nDominion Midstream evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by FERC or historical experience, as well as discussions with FERC and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nAt December 31, 2015, Dominion Midstream reported $295.5 million of goodwill on its Balance Sheet.\nIn April of each year, Dominion Midstream tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nIn general, Dominion Midstream estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion Midstream's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Midstream has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based\nthose estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. With the exception of the reporting unit containing goodwill associated with the DCG Acquisition as discussed below, if the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair value would have still been greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nIn connection with the DCG Acquisition, Dominion Midstream recorded $249.6 million of goodwill. As a result, a significant decrease in Dominion Midstream's estimates of future cash flows would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit containing DCG to fall below its carrying value and could result in an assessment that the goodwill associated with that reporting unit is impaired. No such change has occurred in 2015.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset,"}
