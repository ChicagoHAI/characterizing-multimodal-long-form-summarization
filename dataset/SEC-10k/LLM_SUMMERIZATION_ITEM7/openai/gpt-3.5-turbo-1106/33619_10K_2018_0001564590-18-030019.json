Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nOn October 9, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the acquisition of the Company by TransDigm. If the Merger is consummated, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm. Each Company shareholder will receive $122.50 per share in cash, subject to any withholding taxes. The Merger, which is expected to close in 2019, is subject to the receipt of approval by the Company's shareholders, certain required regulatory or foreign investment approvals, and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the Merger, shares of our common stock will cease trading on the NYSE.\nThe Company will hold a special meeting of our stockholders to vote on adoption of the Merger Agreement, and will provide additional information regarding the proposed Merger and the Merger Agreement to our stockholders and the SEC in connection with the special meeting.\nFor additional information related to the Merger and the Merger Agreement, please refer to the full text of the Merger Agreement and the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, which have been filed as Exhibits to the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 10, 2018, and October 11, 2018, respectively.\nWe operate our businesses in three segments: Avionics & Controls, Sensors & Systems and Advanced Materials. Our segments are structured around our technical capabilities. All segments include sales to domestic, international, defense and commercial customers.\nThe Avionics & Controls segment includes avionics systems, control and communication systems, and interface technologies capabilities. Avionics systems designs and develops cockpit systems integration and avionics solutions for commercial and military applications and visualization solutions for a variety of demanding defense and commercial aerospace applications. Control and communication systems designs and manufactures technology interface systems for military and commercial aircraft and land- and sea-based military vehicles. Additionally, control and communication systems designs and manufactures military audio and data products for severe battlefield environments and communication control systems to enhance security and aural clarity in military applications. Interface technologies manufactures and develops custom control panels and input systems for medical, industrial, military and gaming industries.\nThe Sensors & Systems segment includes power systems, connection technologies and advanced sensors capabilities. Power systems develops and manufactures electrical power switching and other related systems, principally for aerospace and defense customers. Connection technologies develops and manufactures highly engineered connectors for harsh environments and serves the aerospace, defense & space, power generation, rail and industrial equipment markets. Advanced sensors develops and manufactures high-precision temperature and pressure sensors for aerospace and defense customers.\nThe Advanced Materials segment includes engineered materials and defense technologies capabilities. Engineered materials develops and manufactures thermally engineered components and high-performance elastomer clamping devices used in commercial aerospace and military applications. Defense technologies develops and manufactures combustible ordnance components and warfare countermeasure devices for military customers. This segment includes results from the Kirkhill business prior to its March 15, 2018 sale.\nOur current business and strategic plan focuses on the continued development of products and solutions principally for aerospace and defense markets. We are concentrating our efforts to expand our capabilities in these markets, anticipate the global needs of our customers and respond to such needs with comprehensive solutions. These efforts focus on continuous research and new product development, acquisitions and strategic realignments of operations to expand our capabilities as a more comprehensive supplier to our customers across our entire product offering.\nIn March 2014 we entered into a Consent Agreement with the DTCC to resolve alleged ITAR civil violations. The Consent Agreement was closed in fiscal 2017.\nIn fiscal 2017 we evaluated the ongoing performance challenges at our elastomer business based in Brea, California, known as the Kirkhill business, resulting in the decision to explore all strategic options associated with the business. The historic volatility of this business's results of operations was a consideration in this evaluation. In March 2018 the Board of Directors approved the sale of the Kirkhill business, and on March 15, 2018, we sold the assets and certain liabilities of this business to TransDigm, Inc. for $50 million before selling costs. We incurred a $3.7 million loss on sale of the business and an after tax gain of $2.1 million. The after-tax gain was due to the release of a capital loss valuation reserve of $4.9 million and an additional tax benefit of $4.1 million recognized as a result of the loss on the sale of the business. Based on current discontinued operations accounting guidance, the sale of the Kirkhill business does not qualify as a discontinued operation, and was therefore included in the Advanced Materials segment. Operating earnings (loss) for the Kirkhill business are summarized below:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,129\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general & administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research, development and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Earnings (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,721\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,041\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (Gain) on Sale of Business, Net of Tax:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Expense (Benefit):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Release of Capital Loss Valuation Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2014 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of outstanding shares of common stock. In March 2015 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million for the repurchase of outstanding shares of common stock under the program. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of the outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. In the first half of fiscal 2018 the Company repurchased 601,400 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $72.25, for an aggregate purchase price of $43.4 million. There were no shares repurchased during fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2016 we repurchased 304,577 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $61.51, for an aggregate purchase price of $18.7 million. Since the program began, the Company has repurchased 3,737,327 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $352.0 million, with $48.0 million in shares remaining available for repurchase in the future.\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nConsolidated sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $535.3 million compared with $528.7 million in the prior-year period. The $6.6 million increase was mainly due to higher sales for Avionics & Controls segment products of $9.6 million\nand higher sales of Sensors & Systems segment products of $12.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in fiscal 2018 as a result of the March 2018 sale of the Kirkhill business in the Advanced Materials segment.\nGross margin was 34.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 31.4% in the prior-year period. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited from strong gross margin in our Sensors & Systems and Advanced Materials segments, while the gross margin in Avionics & Controls was slightly weaker compared with the prior-year period. For further explanation regarding changes in sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 over the prior-year period, refer to the table at the end of the Overview section for a roll forward presentation of sales and gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million to $89.2 million, or 16.7% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period.\nTransaction costs related to the possible sale of the Company were $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. These costs consisted of legal and advisory fees.\nResearch, development and engineering expense decreased by $11.4 million to $17.5 million, or 3.3% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period. The decrease primarily reflected lower research, development and engineering activity across all segments as certain programs moved forward into production.\nAs explained in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The income tax rate was 25.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 23.3% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Act of $1.4 million, was 23.1%. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the repeal of certain benefits of foreign tax regimes in fiscal 2017 with an offset associated with a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in fiscal 2018.\nEarnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $49.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $52.7 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with $30.4 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nFiscal 2018\nSales for fiscal 2018 were $2.035 billion compared to $2.000 billion in the prior-year period. The $34.5 million increase in sales was mainly due to increased segment sales at Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems, partially offset by lower Advanced Materials sales due to the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nConsolidated gross margin was 32.7% and 33.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems segment gross margin were weaker than the prior-year period and Advanced Materials segment gross margin increased over the prior-year period.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million to $387.2 million, or 19.0% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, mainly due to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates and higher professional fees principally for government contract data security compliance requirements.\nTransaction costs related to exploring strategic options for the possible sale of the Company were $7.2 million in fiscal 2018.\nResearch, development and engineering spending decreased by $18.9 million to $90.9 million or 4.5% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, reflecting lower activity across all segments.\nIn fiscal 2018 we granted exclusive licenses to third parties to manufacture, repair and sell certain legacy avionics components and control devices for $7.5 million. We recorded $5.3 million in license fee income, net of the write-off of the related intangible assets of $2.2 million. We are paid a 15% royalty on future sales of the licensed products. License fee income is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Avionics & Controls segment earnings.\nIn fiscal 2017 we received a $7.8 million insurance recovery resulting from an energetic incident at one of our countermeasure operations, which occurred in fiscal 2016. The insurance recovery is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Advanced Materials segment earnings.\nThe income tax rate was 54.6% in fiscal 2018 compared with 21.5% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in fiscal 2018, excluding the effect of the Act of $49.9 million, was 22.1%. At September 28, 2018, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income tax. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we updated our provisional estimate related to the measurement of our deferred income tax balance from $6.6 million to $7.2 million and our estimate of the one-time provisional transition tax liability from $42.0 million to $39.2 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional estimate of $3.5 million of tax expense on our foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. In addition, the income tax rate for fiscal 2018 also reflected a $4.9 million tax benefit from a release of a capital loss valuation reserve due to a realized capital gain upon the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nEarnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 were $68.8 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, compared with $118.9 million, or $3.96 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 was $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $7.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income for fiscal 2018 was $69.5 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with $111.6 million, or $3.72 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nCash flows from operating activities were $214.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared with $193.4 million in the prior-year period, mainly reflecting a lower use of cash for working capital.\nOur sales, gross profit and earnings results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 28, 2018, compared with the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 29, 2017, included a number of significant items which are summarized in the tables below.\nThe following is a roll forward of sales and gross profit from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td>

The income tax rate in the current year was higher primarily due to U.K. limitations on interest expense deductions. Both years benefited from various tax credits, certain foreign interest deductions, and lower income tax rates on permanently invested foreign sourced income. The income tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 principally reflected the following discrete income tax items:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During fiscal 2017, we recognized $8.6 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to a reduction of the income tax rate in France for fiscal year 2020 and beyond and the early adoption of the accounting standard update for employee share-based payment awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In fiscal 2016, we recognized approximately $2.9 million of discrete tax benefits principally related to the enactment of tax laws reducing the U.K. statutory income tax rate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital and Statement of Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2018 totaled $372.4 million, an increase of $64.6 million from September 28, 2018. Net working capital increased to $900.9 million at the end of fiscal 2018 from $874.9 million at the end of the prior year.\nCash flows from operating activities were $214.1 million and $193.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase principally reflected lower uses of working capital. Sources and uses of cash flows from operating activities principally consisted of cash received from the sale of products and cash payments for material, labor and operating expense.\nCash flows used by investing activities were $2.0 million and $57.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal 2018 mainly reflected purchases of capital assets of $53.3 million and proceeds from the sale of the Kirkhill business of $47.8 million and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations assets and capital assets of $3.4 million. Cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected capital expenditures of $58.0 million.\nCash flows used by financing activities were $138.7 million and $94.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows used by financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected repayment of long-term debt and credit facilities of $142.6 million and $43.4 million in share repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term credit facilities of $45.0 million and $2.8 million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash flows used by financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected repayment of long-term debt and credit facilities of $126.4 million, partially offset by $28.1 million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and $5.0 million in proceeds from our credit facilities.\nCapital Expenditures\nNet property, plant and equipment was $314.8 million at September 28, 2018, compared with $348.6 million at September 29, 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were $53.3 million and $58.0 million, respectively, and included facilities, machinery, equipment and enhancements to information technology systems.\nDebt Financing\nU.S. Credit Facility\nOn April 9, 2015, we amended the secured credit facility to extend the expiration to April 9, 2020, increase the revolving credit facility to $500 million, and provide for a delayed-draw term loan facility of $250 million. We recorded $2.3 million in debt issuance costs. The credit facility is secured by substantially all the Company's assets and interest is based on standard inter-bank offering rates. The interest rate ranges from LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 2.00%, depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn. At September 28, 2018, we did not have an outstanding balance under the secured credit facility. An additional $15.1 million of unsecured foreign currency credit facilities have been extended by foreign banks for a\ntotal of $515.1 million available companywide. Available credit under the above credit facilities was $498.9 million at fiscal 2018 year end, when reduced by letters of credit of $16.2 million.\nU.S. Term Loan, due April 2020\nOn August 3, 2015, we borrowed $250 million under the delayed-draw term loan provided for under the amended credit facility. The interest rate on this loan ranges from LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 2.00%, depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn. At September 28, 2018, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 1.50%, which equaled 3.75%. The loan amortizes at 1.25% of the original principal balance quarterly through March 2020, with the remaining balance due in April 2020. At September 28, 2018, we had $180.0 million outstanding on the U.S. Term Loan.\n3.625% Senior Notes, due April 2023\nIn April 2015 we issued \u20ac330.0 million in 3.625% Senior Notes, due April 2023 (2023 Notes) requiring semi-annual interest payments in April and October of each year until maturity. The notes are designated as a net investment hedge and translated to U.S. dollars each period, with the associated gains or losses recorded to AOCI. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after deducting $5.9 million of debt issuance costs, were $350.8 million. The 2023 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The 2023 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company that are guarantors under the Company's existing secured credit facility. The 2023 Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at redemption prices starting at 102.719% of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning April 15, 2018, and declining annually to 100% of principal and accrued interest on or after April 15, 2021. At September 28, 2018, we had $383.0 million outstanding on the 2023 Notes.\nWe believe cash on hand, funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal 2019. We believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 19, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of outstanding shares of common stock. In March 2015 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of the outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased 2,562,122 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $101.29, for an aggregate purchase price of $259.5 million. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 304,577 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $61.51, for an aggregate purchase price of $18.7 million. There were no shares repurchased during fiscal 2017. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 601,400 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $72.25, for an aggregate purchase price of $43.4 million. Since the program began, the Company has repurchased 3,737,327 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $352.0 million, with $48.0 million in shares remaining available for repurchase in the future.\nPermanent Investment of Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries\nOur non-U.S. subsidiaries have $330 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 28, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents at our U.S. parent and subsidiaries aggregated $42 million at September 28, 2018, and cash flow from these operations and credit facilities are sufficient to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt repayments of our domestic operations. We have available credit to our U.S. parent and subsidiaries of $498.9 million under our U.S. secured credit facility. We recorded a provisional amount of $3.5 million of tax expense on our foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. The provisional amounts may change as new information becomes available, as the Act continues to be interpreted and as new technical guidance is issued. The amount of undistributed foreign earnings which remains indefinitely reinvested at September 28, 2018, is approximately $483.0 million. The amount of deferred income taxes related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practical to compute due to the complexity of our international holding company structure and the complexity of computing foreign tax credits.\nGovernment Refundable Advances\nGovernment refundable advances consist of payments received from the Canadian government to assist in the research and development related to commercial aviation that is conducted at our Canadian operations, CMC Electronics, Inc. (CMC). These advances totaled $43.9 million and $45.5 million at September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017, respectively. The estimated repayment of this advance is based on year-over-year revenue growth of specific CMC's commercial aviation specific product lines from 2013 to 2027. Imputed interest on the advance was negative 1.65% at September 28, 2018 resulting from future year-over-year revenue growth being lower than previously estimated.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations\nOur pension plans principally include a U.S. pension plan maintained by Esterline, non-U.S. plans maintained by CMC, and other non-U.S. plans. Our principal post-retirement plans include non-U.S. plans maintained by CMC, which are non-contributory health care and life insurance plans.\nWe account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date, and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits. Our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, operating cash flow included $7.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of cash funding to the non-U.S. pension plans maintained primarily by CMC. There is no funding requirement for fiscal 2019 for the U.S. pension plans maintained by Esterline. We expect pension funding requirements for the CMC pension plans and other non-U.S. pension plans to be approximately $5.5 million in fiscal 2019. The rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on long-term target asset allocations of 70% equity and 30% fixed income. We periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long-term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type, and accordingly, believe a 3.00% to 7.50% assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate for the pension plans. Current allocations are consistent with the long-term targets.\nWe made the following assumptions with respect to our Esterline pension obligation in fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal assumptions as of fiscal year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate of increase in future compensation levels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe made the following assumptions with respect to our CMC pension obligation in fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal assumptions as of fiscal year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate of increase in future compensation levels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe made the following assumptions with respect to our other non-U.S. pension obligations in fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal assumptions as of fiscal year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.50 - 9.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.40 - 8.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate of increase in future compensation levels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.20 - 10.31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.96 - 10.29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00 - 7.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.25 - 8.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high-quality corporate bonds and matched to plan-specific projected benefit payments. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points in fiscal 2018, pension liabilities in total would have decreased $12.8 million or increased $13.5 million, respectively. Had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points, fiscal 2018 pension expense would have decreased $0.9 million or increased $0.8 million, respectively.

A 100 basis points increase in the health care trend rate would increase our post-retirement benefit obligation by $1.3 million at September 28, 2018. A 100 basis points decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease our post-retirement benefit obligation by $1.1 million at September 28, 2018. Assuming all other assumptions are held constant, the estimated effect on fiscal 2018 post-retirement benefit expense from a hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in the health care trend rate would not have a material effect on our post-retirement benefit expense.\nResearch and Development Expense\nFor the three years ended September 28, 2018, research and development expense averaged 5.0% of sales. In fiscal 2018 research and development expense was 4.5% of sales.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of fiscal 2018 year end.

Moreover, our first fiscal quarter, October through December, includes significant holiday vacation periods in both Europe and North America. This leads to decreased order and shipment activity; consequently, first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters.\nDisclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risks\nOur debt includes fixed rate and variable rate obligations at September 28, 2018. Our ratio of fixed and variable rate to total obligations was 67% and 33%, respectively at September 28, 2018. We are not subject to interest rate risk on the fixed rate obligations. We are subject to interest rate risk on the U.S. Term Loan and U.S. credit facility. For long-term debt, the table below presents principal cash flows and the related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturities.\nA hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in average market rates would not have a material effect on our pretax income.\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Long-Term Debt - Variable Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rates 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturing in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value at 9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Borrowings under the U.S. Term Loan bear interest at a rate equal to either: (a) the LIBOR rate plus 1.50% or (b) the Base Rate\u201d (defined as the higher of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association's prime rate and the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency Risks\nWe own significant operations in Canada, France and the United Kingdom. To the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency, we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk. Furthermore, we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies. At September 28, 2018, we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk: U.S. dollar-denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar; U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable and payable; and certain forward contracts, which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge. The foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro increased to 0.862 at September 28, 2018, from 0.846 at September 29, 2017; the dollar relative to the British pound increased to 0.767 from 0.746; and the dollar relative to the Canadian dollar increased to 1.291 from 1.247. Foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets, forward contracts and backlog resulted in an $8.3 million loss in fiscal 2018, an $11.9 million loss in fiscal 2017, and a $19.8 million loss in fiscal 2016.\nOur policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions and a portion of our net monetary assets, including the embedded derivatives in our backlog, using forward exchange contracts. We do not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes. At September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017, the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was $450.3 million and $411.0 million, respectively. The notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts include $100 million related to the hedge of a portion of our net monetary assets, including the embedded derivatives in our backlog. The net fair value of our open foreign currency forward contracts was a $6.4 million liability and an $11.3 million asset at September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017, respectively. If the U.S. dollar increased by a hypothetical 5%, the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts at September 28, 2018, would be a decrease in the net liability of $20.1 million. If the U.S. dollar decreased by a hypothetical 5%, the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be an increase in net liability of $24.8 million.\nThe following tables provide information about our significant derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements and certain firmly committed sales transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017. The information about certain firmly committed sales contracts and derivative financial instruments is in U.S. dollar equivalents. For forward foreign currency exchange agreements, the following tables present the notional amounts at the current exchange rate and weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates by contractual maturity dates.\nFirmly Committed Sales Contracts\nOperations with Foreign Functional Currency\nAt September 28, 2018\nPrincipal Amount by Expected Maturity\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> In Thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Firmly Committed Sales Contracts in United States Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Canadian Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Euro\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> British Pound\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Contracts\nOperations with Foreign Functional Currency\nAt September 28, 2018\nNotional Amount by Expected Maturity\nAverage Foreign Currency Exchange Rate (USD/Foreign Currency) 1\nRelated Forward Contracts to Sell U.S. Dollar for Canadian Dollar\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> In Thousands, Except for Average Contract Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> United States Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Avg.

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, accounting for inventories, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for pension benefits, and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is determinable, and the collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale. Sales are net of returns and allowances. Returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty.\nRevenues and profits on fixed-price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). We review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly. The impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in\nwhich the revisions are made. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident. When change orders have been approved by both the Company and the customer for both scope and price and realization is deemed probable, the original contract price is adjusted and revenues are recognized on contract performance (as determined by the achievement of contractual milestones and the cost-to-cost method). For partially approved change orders, costs attributable to unpriced change orders are treated as costs of the contract performance in the period the costs are incurred. Claims are also recognized as contract revenue when approved by both the Company and the customer, based on contract performance. The new standard related to revenue recognition will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances. Judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification, collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor.\nInventories\nWe account for inventories on a first-in, first-out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market. The determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand, selling prices and cost of disposal. Judgment is required when determining inventory cost adjustments. Inventory cost adjustments are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on-hand quantities on a part-level basis relative to forecasted product demand and historical usage.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. We should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAs we have grown through acquisitions, we have accumulated $1.0 billion of goodwill and $40.4 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets out of total assets of $3.0 billion at September 28, 2018. The amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nWe performed our annual impairment review for fiscal 2018 as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and our analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets exists at any of our reporting units.\nThe valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and estimated product life cycles. In making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of the business, including such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows.\nWe used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our 2018 annual impairment test. We believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions. The fair value of all our reporting units exceeds its book value by greater than 12%. A 0.5% change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units of approximately $125.2 million. A 0.5% change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units by $83.9 million. None of these changes would have resulted in any of our reporting units being impaired.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. An asset (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The first step of an impairment test of long-lived assets is to determine the amount of future undiscounted cash flow of the long-lived asset. In the event the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset, a second step is required, and the long-lived asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows.\nAs we have grown through acquisitions, we have accumulated $265.7 million of definite-lived intangible assets. The amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various lawsuits and claims, both as plaintiff and defendant, and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business. We are covered by insurance for general liability, product liability, workers' compensation and certain environmental exposures, subject to certain deductible limits. We are self-insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available. An estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nWe account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date. We select appropriate assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post-retirement benefit obligations. Our assumptions are based upon historical results, the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events. Actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly, are recognized in expense in these periods. Significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation.\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.", "summary": "The report discusses the acquisition of the company by TransDigm, which is expected to close in 2019 and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nOn October 9, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the acquisition of the Company by TransDigm. If the Merger is consummated, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm. Each Company shareholder will receive $122.50 per share in cash, subject to any withholding taxes. The Merger, which is expected to close in 2019, is subject to the receipt of approval by the Company's shareholders, certain required regulatory or foreign investment approvals, and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the Merger, shares of our common stock will cease trading on the NYSE.\nThe Company will hold a special meeting of our stockholders to vote on adoption of the Merger Agreement, and will provide additional information regarding the proposed Merger and the Merger Agreement to our stockholders and the SEC in connection with the special meeting.\nFor additional information related to the Merger and the Merger Agreement, please refer to the full text of the Merger Agreement and the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, which have been filed as Exhibits to the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 10, 2018, and October 11, 2018, respectively.\nWe operate our businesses in three segments: Avionics & Controls, Sensors & Systems and Advanced Materials. Our segments are structured around our technical capabilities. All segments include sales to domestic, international, defense and commercial customers.\nThe Avionics & Controls segment includes avionics systems, control and communication systems, and interface technologies capabilities. Avionics systems designs and develops cockpit systems integration and avionics solutions for commercial and military applications and visualization solutions for a variety of demanding defense and commercial aerospace applications. Control and communication systems designs and manufactures technology interface systems for military and commercial aircraft and land- and sea-based military vehicles. Additionally, control and communication systems designs and manufactures military audio and data products for severe battlefield environments and communication control systems to enhance security and aural clarity in military applications. Interface technologies manufactures and develops custom control panels and input systems for medical, industrial, military and gaming industries.\nThe Sensors & Systems segment includes power systems, connection technologies and advanced sensors capabilities. Power systems develops and manufactures electrical power switching and other related systems, principally for aerospace and defense customers. Connection technologies develops and manufactures highly engineered connectors for harsh environments and serves the aerospace, defense & space, power generation, rail and industrial equipment markets. Advanced sensors develops and manufactures high-precision temperature and pressure sensors for aerospace and defense customers.\nThe Advanced Materials segment includes engineered materials and defense technologies capabilities. Engineered materials develops and manufactures thermally engineered components and high-performance elastomer clamping devices used in commercial aerospace and military applications. Defense technologies develops and manufactures combustible ordnance components and warfare countermeasure devices for military customers. This segment includes results from the Kirkhill business prior to its March 15, 2018 sale.\nOur current business and strategic plan focuses on the continued development of products and solutions principally for aerospace and defense markets. We are concentrating our efforts to expand our capabilities in these markets, anticipate the global needs of our customers and respond to such needs with comprehensive solutions. These efforts focus on continuous research and new product development, acquisitions and strategic realignments of operations to expand our capabilities as a more comprehensive supplier to our customers across our entire product offering.\nIn March 2014 we entered into a Consent Agreement with the DTCC to resolve alleged ITAR civil violations. The Consent Agreement was closed in fiscal 2017.\nIn fiscal 2017 we evaluated the ongoing performance challenges at our elastomer business based in Brea, California, known as the Kirkhill business, resulting in the decision to explore all strategic options associated with the business. The historic volatility of this business's results of operations was a consideration in this evaluation. In March 2018 the Board of Directors approved the sale of the Kirkhill business, and on March 15, 2018, we sold the assets and certain liabilities of this business to TransDigm, Inc. for $50 million before selling costs. We incurred a $3.7 million loss on sale of the business and an after tax gain of $2.1 million. The after-tax gain was due to the release of a capital loss valuation reserve of $4.9 million and an additional tax benefit of $4.1 million recognized as a result of the loss on the sale of the business. Based on current discontinued operations accounting guidance, the sale of the Kirkhill business does not qualify as a discontinued operation, and was therefore included in the Advanced Materials segment. Operating earnings (loss) for the Kirkhill business are summarized below:\n\nIn June 2014 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of outstanding shares of common stock. In March 2015 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million for the repurchase of outstanding shares of common stock under the program. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of the outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. In the first half of fiscal 2018 the Company repurchased 601,400 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $72.25, for an aggregate purchase price of $43.4 million. There were no shares repurchased during fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2016 we repurchased 304,577 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $61.51, for an aggregate purchase price of $18.7 million. Since the program began, the Company has repurchased 3,737,327 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $352.0 million, with $48.0 million in shares remaining available for repurchase in the future.\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nConsolidated sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $535.3 million compared with $528.7 million in the prior-year period. The $6.6 million increase was mainly due to higher sales for Avionics & Controls segment products of $9.6 million\nand higher sales of Sensors & Systems segment products of $12.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in fiscal 2018 as a result of the March 2018 sale of the Kirkhill business in the Advanced Materials segment.\nGross margin was 34.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 31.4% in the prior-year period. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited from strong gross margin in our Sensors & Systems and Advanced Materials segments, while the gross margin in Avionics & Controls was slightly weaker compared with the prior-year period. For further explanation regarding changes in sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 over the prior-year period, refer to the table at the end of the Overview section for a roll forward presentation of sales and gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million to $89.2 million, or 16.7% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period.\nTransaction costs related to the possible sale of the Company were $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. These costs consisted of legal and advisory fees.\nResearch, development and engineering expense decreased by $11.4 million to $17.5 million, or 3.3% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period. The decrease primarily reflected lower research, development and engineering activity across all segments as certain programs moved forward into production.\nAs explained in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The income tax rate was 25.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 23.3% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Act of $1.4 million, was 23.1%. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the repeal of certain benefits of foreign tax regimes in fiscal 2017 with an offset associated with a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in fiscal 2018.\nEarnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $49.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $52.7 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with $30.4 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nFiscal 2018\nSales for fiscal 2018 were $2.035 billion compared to $2.000 billion in the prior-year period. The $34.5 million increase in sales was mainly due to increased segment sales at Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems, partially offset by lower Advanced Materials sales due to the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nConsolidated gross margin was 32.7% and 33.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems segment gross margin were weaker than the prior-year period and Advanced Materials segment gross margin increased over the prior-year period.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million to $387.2 million, or 19.0% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, mainly due to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates and higher professional fees principally for government contract data security compliance requirements.\nTransaction costs related to exploring strategic options for the possible sale of the Company were $7.2 million in fiscal 2018.\nResearch, development and engineering spending decreased by $18.9 million to $90.9 million or 4.5% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, reflecting lower activity across all segments.\nIn fiscal 2018 we granted exclusive licenses to third parties to manufacture, repair and sell certain legacy avionics components and control devices for $7.5 million. We recorded $5.3 million in license fee income, net of the write-off of the related intangible assets of $2.2 million. We are paid a 15% royalty on future sales of the licensed products. License fee income is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Avionics & Controls segment earnings.\nIn fiscal 2017 we received a $7.8 million insurance recovery resulting from an energetic incident at one of our countermeasure operations, which occurred in fiscal 2016. The insurance recovery is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Advanced Materials segment earnings.\nThe income tax rate was 54.6% in fiscal 2018 compared with 21.5% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in fiscal 2018, excluding the effect of the Act of $49.9 million, was 22.1%. At September 28, 2018, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income tax. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we updated our provisional estimate related to the measurement of our deferred income tax balance from $6.6 million to $7.2 million and our estimate of the one-time provisional transition tax liability from $42.0 million to $39.2 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional estimate of $3.5 million of tax expense on our foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. In addition, the income tax rate for fiscal 2018 also reflected a $4.9 million tax benefit from a release of a capital loss valuation reserve due to a realized capital gain upon the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nEarnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 were $68.8 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, compared with $118.9 million, or $3.96 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 was $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $7.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income for fiscal 2018 was $69.5 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with $111.6 million, or $3.72 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nCash flows from operating activities were $214.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared with $193.4 million in the prior-year period, mainly reflecting a lower use of cash for working capital.\nOur sales, gross profit and earnings results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 28, 2018, compared with the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 29, 2017, included a number of significant items which are summarized in the tables below.\nThe following is a roll forward of sales and gross profit from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018:\n\nThe following is a roll forward of sales and gross profit from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018:\n\nThe following table shows the average foreign exchange rates for the British pound, Canadian dollar and euro relative to the U.S. dollar for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 28, 2018, and September 29, 2017.\n\nThe following tables show the impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for the British pound, Canadian dollar and euro relative to the U.S. dollar on operating earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the prior-year period.\n\nThe following tables show the impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for the British pound, Canadian dollar and euro relative to the U.S. dollar on operating earnings during fiscal 2018 compared with the prior-year period.\n\nResults of Operations\nFor further explanation, refer to the roll forward table of sales and gross profit at the end of the Overview section.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nSales for fiscal 2018 increased by $34.5 million, or 1.7%, from fiscal 2017.\n\nThe $20.8 million increase in Avionics & Controls sales over fiscal 2017 mainly reflected the following:\n \u2022 Higher sales volumes of control and communication systems of $36 million due to higher aftermarket sales of $16 million and increased OEM product sales \n \u2022 Favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $14 million \n \u2022 Favorable price increase for interface technologies of $2 million for medical applications \n \u2022 Partially offset by \n \u2022 Lower sales volumes of avionics systems of $22 million mainly due to decreased simulator program and repair sales and cockpit retrofits \n \u2022 Lower sales volumes of interface technologies mainly for medical and gaming applications of $9 million \nThe $41.7 million increase in Sensors & Systems sales over the prior-year period principally reflected the following:\n \u2022 Favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $34 million \n \u2022 Higher sales volumes of connection technologies of $13", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

In March 2015 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million for the repurchase of outstanding shares of common stock under the program. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $400 million of the outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. In the first half of fiscal 2018 the Company repurchased 601,400 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $72.25, for an aggregate purchase price of $43.4 million. There were no shares repurchased during fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2016 we repurchased 304,577 shares under this program at an average price paid per share of $61.51, for an aggregate purchase price of $18.7 million. Since the program began, the Company has repurchased 3,737,327 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $352.0 million, with $48.0 million in shares remaining available for repurchase in the future.\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nConsolidated sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $535.3 million compared with $528.7 million in the prior-year period. The $6.6 million increase was mainly due to higher sales for Avionics & Controls segment products of $9.6 million\nand higher sales of Sensors & Systems segment products of $12.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in fiscal 2018 as a result of the March 2018 sale of the Kirkhill business in the Advanced Materials segment.\nGross margin was 34.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 31.4% in the prior-year period. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited from strong gross margin in our Sensors & Systems and Advanced Materials segments, while the gross margin in Avionics & Controls was slightly weaker compared with the prior-year period. For further explanation regarding changes in sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 over the prior-year period, refer to the table at the end of the Overview section for a roll forward presentation of sales and gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million to $89.2 million, or 16.7% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period.\nTransaction costs related to the possible sale of the Company were $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. These costs consisted of legal and advisory fees.\nResearch, development and engineering expense decreased by $11.4 million to $17.5 million, or 3.3% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from the prior-year period. The decrease primarily reflected lower research, development and engineering activity across all segments as certain programs moved forward into production.\nAs explained in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The income tax rate was 25.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 23.3% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Act of $1.4 million, was 23.1%. The difference in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the repeal of certain benefits of foreign tax regimes in fiscal 2017 with an offset associated with a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in fiscal 2018.\nEarnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $49.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $52.7 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with $30.4 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nFiscal 2018\nSales for fiscal 2018 were $2.035 billion compared to $2.000 billion in the prior-year period. The $34.5 million increase in sales was mainly due to increased segment sales at Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems, partially offset by lower Advanced Materials sales due to the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nConsolidated gross margin was 32.7% and 33.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Avionics & Controls and Sensors & Systems segment gross margin were weaker than the prior-year period and Advanced Materials segment gross margin increased over the prior-year period.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million to $387.2 million, or 19.0% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, mainly due to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates and higher professional fees principally for government contract data security compliance requirements.\nTransaction costs related to exploring strategic options for the possible sale of the Company were $7.2 million in fiscal 2018.\nResearch, development and engineering spending decreased by $18.9 million to $90.9 million or 4.5% of sales, compared with fiscal 2017, reflecting lower activity across all segments.\nIn fiscal 2018 we granted exclusive licenses to third parties to manufacture, repair and sell certain legacy avionics components and control devices for $7.5 million. We recorded $5.3 million in license fee income, net of the write-off of the related intangible assets of $2.2 million. We are paid a 15% royalty on future sales of the licensed products. License fee income is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Avionics & Controls segment earnings.\nIn fiscal 2017 we received a $7.8 million insurance recovery resulting from an energetic incident at one of our countermeasure operations, which occurred in fiscal 2016. The insurance recovery is reported as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is included in Advanced Materials segment earnings.\nThe income tax rate was 54.6% in fiscal 2018 compared with 21.5% in the prior-year period. The income tax rate in fiscal 2018, excluding the effect of the Act of $49.9 million, was 22.1%. At September 28, 2018, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income tax. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we updated our provisional estimate related to the measurement of our deferred income tax balance from $6.6 million to $7.2 million and our estimate of the one-time provisional transition tax liability from $42.0 million to $39.2 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional estimate of $3.5 million of tax expense on our foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. In addition, the income tax rate for fiscal 2018 also reflected a $4.9 million tax benefit from a release of a capital loss valuation reserve due to a realized capital gain upon the sale of the Kirkhill business.\nEarnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 were $68.8 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, compared with $118.9 million, or $3.96 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 was $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $7.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income for fiscal 2018 was $69.5 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with $111.6 million, or $3.72 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nCash flows from operating activities were $214.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared with $193.4 million in the prior-year period, mainly reflecting a lower use of cash for working capital.\nOur sales, gross profit and earnings results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 28, 2018, compared with the three- and twelve-month periods ended September 29, 2017, included a number of significant items which are summarized in the
