NRP Finance Corporation (\"NRP Finance\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP and a co-issuer with NRP on the 10.50% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\").\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, operating, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates and other natural resources. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NRP\".\nOur business is organized into three operating segments:\nCoal Royalty and Other-consists primarily of coal royalty properties and coal-related transportation and processing assets. Other assets include aggregate, industrial mineral and oil and gas royalty properties and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are primarily located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana. Our oil and gas royalty assets are primarily located in Louisiana.\nSoda Ash-consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.\nConstruction Aggregates-consists of our construction materials business that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. The construction aggregates business operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated financial results included:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing cash flow (used in) continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(141,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Cash Flow (\"DCF\") (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See \"Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Recapitalization Transactions and Debt Reduction\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we completed the recapitalization transactions that improved our liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet. These recapitalization transactions included the issuance of $250 million of Class A Preferred Units and the issuance of Warrants to purchase Common Units, and the extension of the majority of our 2018 debt maturities to 2020 and 2022. For more information on these transactions, see Note 3. Class A Convertible Preferred Units and Warrants and Note 13. Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring 2017, we reduced our debt by $311.1 million. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for additional information on our debt reduction. We remain focused on further reducing our debt, improving our credit metrics and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\nCurrent Results/Market Commentary\nCoal Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coal Royalty and Other business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMetallurgical coal prices were significantly higher during 2017 as compared to the prior year driven by supply constraints and a 5% increase in worldwide steel production, according to data published by the World Steel Association. Increased steel demand combined with a reduction in Chinese steel exports led to higher steel prices and steel producer profit margins internationally, which supports higher prices for raw material inputs such as metallurgical coal and coke. Declines in Australian metallurgical exports due to impacts from Cyclone Debbie, logistical constraints and industry-wide operational challenges led to positive metallurgical coal supply and demand fundamentals. While domestic metallurgical coal production increased in 2017, domestic supply response was impacted by a lack of capital investment and workforce constraints. As a result of these market conditions, metallurgical prices in 2017 reached the highest levels since 2012. Benefiting from higher metallurgical coal prices, we derived approximately 58% of our coal royalty revenues and approximately 45% of our coal royalty production from metallurgical coal during 2017. For 2018, we expect metallurgical coal markets to remain tight due to continued global economic growth and supportive steel industry fundamentals combined with logistical and operational supply constraints across the industry.\nThermal coal prices in Appalachia improved over the prior year primarily as a result of increased export demand from Asia and northern Europe whereas Illinois Basin thermal prices remained relatively flat year over year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, domestic electricity generation from coal decreased 3% during 2017 and was negatively impacted by mild weather in coal heavy regions, coal plant retirements and continued gains by renewables in the electricity generation mix. During 2017, thermal coal benefited from higher average natural gas prices, which increased 18%, from $2.55/mmBtu in 2016 to $3.02/mmBtu in 2017. Coal's relative share of the electricity generation mix in 2017 was roughly flat at 30% of the total, while the relative share of natural gas declined from 34% in 2016 to 32% in 2017. As a result, domestic thermal markets were oversupplied in 2017 despite the relative strength in export demand and shrinking utility inventory stockpiles. During 2018, we expect domestic thermal coal markets to remain challenged. Long term, domestic thermal production and prices will continue to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices, coal fired power plant retirements and the availability of renewable generation.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Soda Ash business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2017, international prices for soda ash, particularly in Asia, continued to be strong, and domestic prices have improved slightly over 2016. Income from this segment was slightly higher in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as the effect of the increased prices noted above were offset by temporary production issues that were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received distributions totaling $49.0 million.\nWe expect the international market to remain strong in 2018 as a result of continued strength in Asia and a smaller than expected impact from the new soda ash production capacity coming on line in Turkey. Prices, both internationally and domestically, are expected to remain around current levels during the year.\nConstruction Aggregates Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Construction Aggregates business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow used by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing cash flow used by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur overall construction aggregates performance in the year ended December 31, 2017 improved compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher production and sales of crushed stone, gravel and sand, higher delivery and haul income and increased road construction and asphalt paving projects. Our construction aggregates business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves. In particular, key drivers of performance in the regions of our operations include: 1) natural gas drilling customers in the Marcellus shale, 2) traditional construction markets of Southwest Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, 3) energy-related and infrastructure spending in the Louisiana market, and 4) military spending in the Clarksville, Tennessee market.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Other Income\nRevenues and other income decreased $22.0 million, or 6%, from $400.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $378.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

However, the decrease in property tax revenue was fully offset by lower property tax expenses as described in operating and maintenance expenses below. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in coal override revenue as discussed above.\nGain on coal royalty and other segment asset sales decreased $25.5 million year-over-year primarily as a result of numerous asset sales completed during the year ended December 30, 2016.\nConstruction Aggregates\nThe table below presents the significant categories of Construction Aggregates revenues:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crushed stone, sand & gravel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery and fuel income\n</td> <td>38,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Road construction and asphalt paving\n</td> <td>18,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction aggregates revenues\n</td> <td>131,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset sales, net\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,292\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction aggregates revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and other income related to our Construction Aggregates segment increased $10.9 million, or 9%, from $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $131.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Total coal royalty revenues decreased $42.3 million, or 29%, from $144.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $101.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Total coal\nproduction and coal royalty revenue decreases were driven by downward pressure in the coal markets as described above, with Central Appalachian thermal coal producers in particular continuing to face challenges, as their production costs remain high relative to sales prices.\nTotal other revenues increased $8.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the agreements with certain lessees to either modify or terminate existing coal-related leases that resulted in the recognition of $40.5 million of deferred revenue. This increase was partially offset by non-recurring revenue transactions in 2015 that included $21.0 million in lease assignment fees and $9.3 million gain on reserve swap. Other revenues were also decreased $4.9 million in 2016 primarily as a result of the sale of our aggregates royalty assets in the first quarter of 2016.\nGain on coal royalty and other segment asset sales increased $22.1 million primarily as a result of the following asset sales during the first quarter of 2016:\n1)Oil and gas royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin for\n$36.4 million gross sales proceeds. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016, and we recorded an $18.6 million\ngain from this sale.\n2)Aggregate reserves and related royalty rights in the Coal Royalty and Other segment at three aggregates operations located\nin Texas, Georgia and Tennessee for $10.0 million gross sales proceeds. The effective date of the sale was February 1,\n2016, and we recorded a $1.5 million gain from this sale.\nSoda Ash\nRevenues and other income related to our equity investment in Ciner Wyoming decreased $9.8 million, or 20%, from $49.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $40.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to lower international prices compared to the prior year, in addition to higher royalty and G&A costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in soda ash volumes sold compared to the prior year.\nConstruction Aggregates\nThe table below presents the significant categories of Construction Aggregates revenues:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per ton data)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crushed stone, sand & gravel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,964\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery and fuel income\n</td> <td>36,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,609\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Road construction and asphalt paving\n</td> <td>17,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>120,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on asset sales, net\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction aggregates revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,198\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and other income related to our Construction Aggregates segment decreased $18.2 million, or 13%, from $139.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone revenue as well as lower delivery and fuel income year-over-year. Tonnage sold by the Construction Aggregates segment decreased 0.4 million tons, or 5% from 7.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 to 7.0 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of decreased construction aggregates demand in the oil and gas services sector that was partially offset by increased aggregates sales into the construction market.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) decreased $21.8 million, or 14%, from $152.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $130.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) in our Construction Aggregates segment decreased $16.2 million, or 14% from $116.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $100.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to the decline in materials cost as a result of the decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone volume year-over-year due to reduced demand in the oil and gas sector and a decrease in delivery and fuel costs due to the lower construction aggregates production and brokered stone purchases year-over-year partially and effective variable cost management.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense decreased $14.6 million, or 24%, from $60.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $46.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the reduced cost basis of our coal and aggregates royalty mineral rights due to the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the decline in coal royalty production year-over-year.\nGeneral and Administrative (\"G&A\") Expense (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $8.3 million, or 67%, from $12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $20.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily related to increased legal and consulting fees associated with the implementation of our long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance our liquidity and increased LTIP expense as a result of our unit price increasing in 2016 compared to decreasing unit price in 2015 and the accelerated recognition of our LTIP awards granted in 2016\nAsset Impairment\nAsset impairments decreased $367.6 million, or 96%, from $384.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.

This decrease is primarily related to $257.5 million in coal property impairment, $70.5 million in oil and gas property impairment and $43.4 million in aggregate property impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12.1 million in coal property impairment and $1.7 million in aggregate property impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. The impairments in 2015 primarily resulted from the continued deterioration and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, sustained low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry.\nConstruction Aggregates\nAsset impairments decreased $5.1 million, or 82%, from $6.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the $5.5 million write off of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations increased $313.2 million, from a loss of $311.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to income of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in income (loss) from discontinued operations is primarily related to the $297.0 million asset impairments recorded in 2015, the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets that was completed in July 2016 with an effective date of April 1, 2016 and the $8.3 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nThe

year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily a result of $42.3 million in reduced coal royalty revenue resulting from decreased coal production and coal royalty revenue per ton driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above, $21.0 million in non-recurring 2015 lease assignment fees, $4.9 million of reduced aggregates royalty revenue in 2016 due to decreased 2016 aggregates production and sales and $8.3 million of additional G&A expense in 2016 compared to 2015 as described above. These decreases were partially offset by a $49.1 million increase in minimums recognized as revenue primarily as a result of coal lease modifications or terminations that resulted in our lessee forfeiting their minimum royalty balances and $22.2 million of additional gains on asset sales as compared to the same period in 2015.

December 31, 2015 to $271.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is due primarily to the $109.9 million net cash proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operation in addition to $61.0 million in net cash proceeds from sales of mineral rights in 2016. These increases were partially offset by lower coal royalty production, lower coal royalty revenue per ton and less minimum payments received from our coal leases. These decreases are driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above. See \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Distributable Cash Flow\" for an explanation of Distributable Cash Flow.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrent Liquidity\nThe principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash on hand and our available borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $29.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $90.0 million in borrowing capacity under our Opco Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reduced our debt by approximately $311.1 million as summarized in the table below:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Difference\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Instrument (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NRP LP Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(425,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opco debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>422,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>827,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(311,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, in March 2017, we issued $250 million of Class A Convertible Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in NRP (the \"Preferred Units\"). The Preferred Units entitle the Preferred Purchasers to receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 12% per year, up to one half of which we may pay in additional Preferred Units (such additional Preferred Units, the \"PIK Units\"). For more information on the terms of the Preferred Units, see Note 3. Class A Convertible Preferred Units and Warrants in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. During 2017, we declared $17.7 million in distributions on the Preferred Units, one-half of which were paid in cash. In February 2018, we paid the entire $7.8 million distribution on the Preferred Units in cash and redeemed all of the outstanding PIK Units, which resulted in an additional $8.8 million cash payment.\nThe March 2017 recapitalization transactions increased our liquidity and extended the majority of our 2018 debt maturities to 2020 and 2022. Even with these meaningful improvements to our liquidity and balance sheet, we continue to have substantial debt outstanding and intend to continue to use cash from operations to deleverage our balance sheet over time. While we have a diversified portfolio of assets, we face challenges in coal and other commodity markets and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nCash Flows\nCash flow provided by operating activities increased $19.2 million, from $108.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $127.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows from continuing operations increased $27.2 million primarily from increased operational performance from our Coal Royalty and Other segment assets year-over-year. This increase was partially offset by an $8.0 million decrease in operating cash flow from discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations represent cash flow from operations of these assets prior to the sale date.\nCash flow provided by operating activities decreased $95.4 million, from $203.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $108.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased $70.4 million in our Coal Royalty and Other segment year-over-year primarily as a result of the reduction in coal royalty revenue and reduction of coal royalty minimum cash payments received on certain leases. Cash flow provided by operating activities of discontinued operations decreased $27.6 million, from $34.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $7.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of completing the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016 that had an effective date of April 1, 2016.\nCash flow provided by investing activities decreased $163.3 million, from $166.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Investing cash flows from discontinued operations decreased $106.7 million primarily as a result of the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in 2016 for $109.9 million in net\ncash proceeds. Investing cash flows from continuing operations decreased $56.6 million primarily as a result of the proceeds received in 2016 from the sales of our oil and gas and aggregates royalty properties.\nCash flow provided by investing activities increased $197.1 million, from $30.3 million used in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $166.8 million provided in the year ended December 31, 2016. Investing cash flows from discontinued operations increased $144.2 million primarily as a result of the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016 for $109.9 million in net cash proceeds in addition to a $37.8 million decrease in cash flow used as a result of lower oil and gas drilling activity and the non-operated working interest asset sale in July 2016. Investing cash flows from continuing operations increased $52.9 million primarily as a result of 2016 sales of oil and gas and aggregate royalty properties.\nCash flow used in financing activities decreased $145.0 million from $286.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $141.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease in cash flow used is primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of Preferred Units and warrants and 2022 Senior Notes. These proceeds were partially offset by additional debt repayments year-over-year and the fees paid related to the March 2017 recapitalization transactions.\nCash flow used in financing activities increased $114.7 million, from $171.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $286.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations increased $136.6 million primarily as a result of using $85.0 million to repay the RBL Credit Facility and contributing the $39.4 million of discontinued asset sales proceeds that remained after repayment of the RBL Facility in full to continuing operations. This increase in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by a $21.9 million decrease in cash flow used in financing activities from continuing operations primarily a result of distributing $49.3 million less cash to partners and receiving the remaining net proceeds from discontinuing operations after repayment as described above.\nCapital Expenditures\nA portion of the capital expenditures associated with our construction aggregates segment are maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production capacity of those businesses. Expansion capital expenditures are made to increase productive capacity. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating DCF.\nCapital Resources and Obligations\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had the following indebtedness:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and debt, net\n</td> <td>729,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>990,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>809,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been and continue to be in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements.

Business and Properties-Regulation and Environmental Matters.\"\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe information required by this Item is included under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 15. Related Party Transactions\" and \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of our significant accounting policies. The following critical accounting policies are affected by estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenues\nCoal Royalty and Other Revenues. Coal royalty and other revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of mineral sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of mineral they sell. While we may have multiple contracts with a single lessee, they are accounted for as separate arrangements.\nMost of our coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments are recorded as a deferred revenue liability when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as revenue based upon the underlying mineral lease when the lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following the expiration of the lessee's ability to recoup the payments.\nOil and gas related revenues consist of revenues from royalties and overriding royalties. Oil and gas royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales.\nTransportation and Processing. Transportation fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material transported over the beltlines. Under the terms of the transportation contracts, we receive a fixed price per ton for all material transported on the beltlines. Processing fees are recognized on the basis of tons of material processed through the facilities by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales. Generally, the lessees of the processing facilities make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of material that is processed and sold from the facilities. The processing leases are structured in a manner so that the lessees are responsible for operating and maintenance expenses associated with the facilities. These fees are recorded in Transportation and processing fees (or Transportation and processing fees-affiliate) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nEquity in Earnings of Ciner Wyoming. We account for non-marketable equity investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. Significant influence generally exists if we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. We account for our investment in Ciner Wyoming using this method.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. The basis difference between the investment and the proportional share of the investee's net assets is hypothetically allocated first to identified tangible assets and liabilities, then to finite-lived intangibles or indefinite-lived intangibles and the remaining balance is attributed to goodwill. The portion of the basis difference attributed to net tangible assets and finite-lived intangibles is amortized over its estimated useful life while indefinite-lived intangibles, if any, and goodwill are not amortized. The amortization of the basis difference is recorded as a reduction of earnings from the equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nOur carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption \"Equity in unconsolidated investment\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our adjusted share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as revenues and other income under the caption \u2018\u2018Equity in earnings of Ciner Wyoming.\" Our share of investee earnings are adjusted to reflect the amortization of any difference between the cost basis of the equity investment and the proportionate share of the investee's net assets, which has been allocated to the fair value of net identified tangible and finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over the estimated lives of those assets.\nConstruction Aggregates Revenues. Revenues from the sale of aggregates, gravel, sand and asphalt are recorded based upon the transfer of product at delivery to customers, which generally occurs at the quarries or asphalt plants.\nRoad Construction and Asphalt Paving. Revenues from long-term construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. That method is used since we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, which result in revisions to job costs and profits are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Contract costs include all direct job costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, insurance, equipment maintenance and depreciation.\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard Adoption. We concluded that the new revenue recognition standard (Topic 606) will have no impact on revenue from our Construction Aggregates or Soda Ash operating segments. However, we determined that adoption of the new revenue recognition standard will impact certain revenue from our coal royalty leases as further described below. The other revenue streams within the Coal Royalty and Other segment will not be impacted.\nUnder the new revenue recognition standard (Topic 606), we have defined our coal royalty lease performance obligation as providing the lessee the right to mine and sell our coal over the lease term. We then evaluated the likelihood that consideration we received from our lessees resulting from coal production would exceed consideration received from minimum payments over the lease term. As a result of this evaluation, revenue recognition from our leases will now be based on either production or minimum payments as follows:\n1.Production Leases: Leases for which we expect that consideration from coal production will be greater than consideration from minimums over the lease term. Revenue recognition for these leases will be recognized over time based on coal production and minimum payments will continue to be deferred until recoupment occurs or the recoupment becomes remote. However, if we receive minimum payments from these coal royalty leases, we will begin to evaluate the likelihood of recoupment and recognize deferred revenue prior to expiration of the recoupment period if it concludes that recoupment is remote.\n2.Minimum Leases: Leases for which we expect that consideration from minimums will be greater than consideration from coal production over the lease term. Revenue recognition for these leases will now be recognized straight line over the lease term based on the minimum payment consideration amount.\nMineral Rights\nMineral rights owned and leased are recorded at its original cost of construction or, upon acquisition, at fair value of the assets acquired. Coal and aggregate mineral rights are depleted on a unit-of-production basis by lease, based upon minerals mined in relation to the net cost of the mineral properties and estimated proven and probable tonnage as defined by the SEC's Industry Guide 7 and estimated by our internal reserve engineers. The technologies and economic data used by our internal reserve engineers in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, drill logs, geophysical logs, geologic maps including isopach, mine, and coal quality, cross sections, statistical analysis, and available public production data. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, any one of which may, if incorrect, result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have developed procedures to periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for possible impairment. These procedures are performed throughout the year and are based on historic, current and future performance and are designed to be early warning tests. If an asset fails one of the early warning tests, additional evaluation is performed for that asset that considers both quantitative and qualitative information. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the future expected undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition is less than the assets' carrying value. Impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value, which is usually determined based upon the present value of the projected future cash flow compared to the assets' carrying value. We believe our estimates of cash flows and discount rates are consistent with those of principal market participants. In addition to the evaluations discussed above, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period may require a separate impairment evaluation be completed on a significant property.\nWe evaluate our equity investment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment loss. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, or upon the present value of expected cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the applicable section of \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion and analysis presents management's view of our business, financial condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this filing. Our discussion and analysis consists of the following subjects:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Environmental Regulation\n\u2022Related Party Transactions\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Standards\nAs used in this Item 7, unless the context otherwise requires: \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" and the \"Partnership\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and, where the context requires, our subsidiaries. References to \"NRP\" and \"Natural Resource Partners\" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. only, and not to NRP (Operating) LLC or any of Natural Resource Partners L.P.'s subsidiaries. References to \"Opco\" refer to NRP (Operating) LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, and its subsidiaries. References to NRP Oil and Gas refer to NRP Oil and Gas LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP. NRP Finance Corporation (\"NRP Finance\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP and a co-issuer with NRP on the 10.50% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\").\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, operating, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates and other natural resources. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NRP\".\nOur business is organized into three operating segments:\nCoal Royalty and Other-consists primarily of coal royalty properties and coal-related transportation and processing assets. Other assets include aggregate, industrial mineral and oil and gas royalty properties and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are primarily located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana. Our oil and gas royalty assets are primarily located in Louisiana.\nSoda Ash-consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.\nConstruction Aggregates-consists of our construction materials business that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. The construction aggregates business operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated financial results included:\n\n \n (1) See \"Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \n2017 Recapitalization Transactions and Debt Reduction\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we completed the recapitalization transactions that improved our liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet. These recapitalization transactions included the issuance of $250 million of Class A Preferred Units and the issuance of Warrants to purchase Common Units, and the extension of the majority of our 2018 debt maturities to 2020 and 2022. For more information on these transactions, see Note 3. Class A Convertible Preferred Units and Warrants and Note 13. Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring 2017, we reduced our debt by $311.1 million. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for additional information on our debt reduction. We remain focused on further reducing our debt, improving our credit metrics and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\nCurrent Results/Market Commentary\nCoal Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coal Royalty and Other business segment financial results included the following:\n\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \nMetallurgical coal prices were significantly higher during 2017 as compared to the prior year driven by supply constraints and a 5% increase in worldwide steel production, according to data published by the World Steel Association. Increased steel demand combined with a reduction in Chinese steel exports led to higher steel prices and steel producer profit margins internationally, which supports higher prices for raw material inputs such as metallurgical coal and coke. Declines in Australian metallurgical exports due to impacts from Cyclone Debbie, logistical constraints and industry-wide operational challenges led to positive metallurgical coal supply and demand fundamentals. While domestic metallurgical coal production increased in 2017, domestic supply response was impacted by a lack of capital investment and workforce constraints. As a result of these market conditions, metallurgical prices in 2017 reached the highest levels since 2012. Benefiting from higher metallurgical coal prices, we derived approximately 58% of our coal royalty revenues and approximately 45% of our coal royalty production from metallurgical coal during 2017. For 2018, we expect metallurgical coal markets to remain tight due to continued global economic growth and supportive steel industry fundamentals combined with logistical and operational supply constraints across the industry.\nThermal coal prices in Appalachia improved over the prior year primarily as a result of increased export demand from Asia and northern Europe whereas Illinois Basin thermal prices remained relatively flat year over year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, domestic electricity generation from coal decreased 3% during 2017 and was negatively impacted by mild weather in coal heavy regions, coal plant retirements and continued gains by renewables in the electricity generation mix. During 2017, thermal coal benefited from higher average natural gas prices, which increased 18%, from $2.55/mmBtu in 2016 to $3.02/mmBtu in 2017. Coal's relative share of the electricity generation mix in 2017 was roughly flat at 30% of the total, while the relative share of natural gas declined from 34% in 2016 to 32% in 2017. As a result, domestic thermal markets were oversupplied in 2017 despite the relative strength in export demand and shrinking utility inventory stockpiles. During 2018, we expect domestic thermal coal markets to remain challenged. Long term, domestic thermal production and prices will continue to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices, coal fired power plant retirements and the availability of renewable generation.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Soda Ash business segment financial results included the following:\n\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, international prices for soda ash, particularly in Asia, continued to be strong, and domestic prices have improved slightly over 2016. Income from this segment was slightly higher in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as the effect of the increased prices noted above were offset by temporary production issues that were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received distributions totaling $49.0 million.\nWe expect the international market to remain strong in 2018 as a result of continued strength in Asia and a smaller than expected impact from the new soda ash production capacity coming on line in Turkey. Prices, both internationally and domestically, are expected to remain around current levels during the year.\nConstruction Aggregates Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Construction Aggregates business segment financial results included the following:\n\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \nOur overall construction aggregates performance in the year ended December 31, 2017 improved compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher production and sales of crushed stone, gravel and sand, higher delivery and haul income and increased road construction and asphalt paving projects. Our construction aggregates business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves. In particular, key drivers of performance in the regions of our operations include: 1) natural gas drilling customers in the Marcellus shale, 2) traditional construction markets of Southwest Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, 3) energy-related and infrastructure spending in the Louisiana market, and 4) military spending in the Clarksville, Tennessee market.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Other Income\nRevenues and other income decreased $22.0 million, or 6%, from $400.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $378.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table shows our revenues and other income by business segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe changes in revenue and other income are discussed for each of the business segments below:\nCoal Royalty and Other\nRevenues and other income related to our Coal Royalty and Other segment decreased $33.3 million, or 14%, from $239.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $205.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The table below presents coal production and coal royalty revenues (including affiliates) derived from our major coal producing regions and the significant categories of other coal royalty and other revenues:\n\nCoal royalty revenues increased $19.0 million, or 19%, from $101.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Further discussion of the key drivers for the increase follows:\n \u2022 Appalachia: Coal royalty revenue increased $30.7 million as a result of increased metallurgical coal prices and production. \n \u2022 Illinois Basin: Lower production partially offset by higher royalty revenue per ton led to a $12.7 million decrease in coal royalty revenue. The decreased production was primarily a result of the temporary relocation of certain production off of NRP's coal reserves, which resulted in a $7.5 million increase in coal overriding royalty revenue and wheelage associated with the production of non-NRP coal. \nTotal other revenues decreased $28.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a $33.8 million decrease in minimums recognized as revenue due to certain lease modifications and terminations in the second quarter 2016 and a $5.3 million decrease in property tax reimbursements. However, the decrease in property tax revenue was fully offset by lower property tax expenses as described in operating and maintenance expenses below. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in coal override revenue as discussed above.\nGain on coal royalty and other segment asset sales decreased $25.5 million year-over-year primarily as a result of numerous asset sales completed during the year ended December 30, 2016.\nConstruction Aggregates\nThe table below presents the significant categories of Construction Aggregates revenues:\n\nRevenues and other income related to our Construction Aggregates segment increased $10.9 million, or 9%, from $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $131.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $6.0 million, or 5%, from $130.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $136.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily related to increased costs within our Construction Aggregates segment, partially offset by decreased costs within the Coal Royalty and Other segment.\n \u2022 Construction Aggregates segment costs increased $11.0 million, or 11% from $100.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $111.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily related to an increase in production costs, repairs and maintenance and labor costs due to the increase in production and sales as discussed above. \n \u2022 Coal Royalty and Other segment costs decreased $5.0 million, or 17% from $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $24.9 million the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily related to $5.8 million lower property tax expense as a result of lower property tax rates and property tax values primarily in Kentucky and West Virginia and lower employee-related costs. \nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense decreased $10.3 million, or 22%, from $46.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $36.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily driven by lower coal production in the Illinois Basin and $1.9 million lower depreciation expense of construction aggregate assets due to fully depreciated assets.\nGeneral and Administrative (\"G&A\") Expense (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs decreased $2.1 million, or 10%, from $20.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $18.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily due to decreased legal, consulting and advisory fees incurred in 2016 as a result of the recapitalization transactions completed in March 2017.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments decreased $13.9 million, or 82%, from $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of certain coal, aggregates and timber properties. Asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of certain coal and hard mineral properties.\nInterest Expense (including affiliates)\nInterest expense (including affiliates) decreased $7.7 million, or 8%, from $90.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $82.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily related to lower debt balances during 2017 as a result of the recapitalization transactions entered into in March 2017.\nDebt Modification Expense\nDebt modification expense was $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and related to costs incurred as a result of the exchange of $241 million of our 2018 Senior Notes for 2022 Senior Notes in March 2017.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and related to the 4.563% premium paid to redeem the 2018 Senior Notes in April 2017.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased $2.2 million, from income of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of the sale of the discontinued non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $23.9 million, or 9%, from $255.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $231.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of the following:\n \u2022 Coal Royalty and Other segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $28.2 million. While performance of our coal-related assets improved as described above, the prior year amount included $40.5 million of revenue resulting from one-time lease modifications and $25.5 million higher gains on asset sales. \n \u2022 Soda Ash segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million as a result of increased cash distributions received in the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Construction Aggregates segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Increased production and sales volume, increased marine terminal activity and higher margins on road construction and asphalt paving projects were offset by increased production costs and repairs and maintenance expenses. \n \u2022 Corporate and financing Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to legal and consulting fees related to the recapitalization activities incurred in 2016. \nSee \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\" for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nThe following table presents the three major categories of the statement of cash flows by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

We remain focused on further reducing our debt, improving our credit metrics and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\nCurrent Results/Market Commentary\nCoal Royalty and Other Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coal Royalty and Other business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \nMetallurgical coal prices were significantly higher during 2017 as compared to the prior year driven by supply constraints and a 5% increase in worldwide steel production, according to data published by the World Steel Association. Increased steel demand combined with a reduction in Chinese steel exports led to higher steel prices and steel producer profit margins internationally, which supports higher prices for raw material inputs such as metallurgical coal and coke. Declines in Australian metallurgical exports due to impacts from Cyclone Debbie, logistical constraints and industry-wide operational challenges led to positive metallurgical coal supply and demand fundamentals. While domestic metallurgical coal production increased in 2017, domestic supply response was impacted by a lack of capital investment and workforce constraints. As a result of these market conditions, metallurgical prices in 2017 reached the highest levels since 2012. Benefiting from higher metallurgical coal prices, we derived approximately 58% of our coal royalty revenues and approximately 45% of our coal royalty production from metallurgical coal during 2017. For 2018, we expect metallurgical coal markets to remain tight due to continued global economic growth and supportive steel industry fundamentals combined with logistical and operational supply constraints across the industry.\nThermal coal prices in Appalachia improved over the prior year primarily as a result of increased export demand from Asia and northern Europe whereas Illinois Basin thermal prices remained relatively flat year over year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, domestic electricity generation from coal decreased 3% during 2017 and was negatively impacted by mild weather in coal heavy regions, coal plant retirements and continued gains by renewables in the electricity generation mix. During 2017, thermal coal benefited from higher average natural gas prices, which increased 18%, from $2.55/mmBtu in 2016 to $3.02/mmBtu in 2017. Coal's relative share of the electricity generation mix in 2017 was roughly flat at 30% of the total, while the relative share of natural gas declined from 34% in 2016 to 32% in 2017. As a result, domestic thermal markets were oversupplied in 2017 despite the relative strength in export demand and shrinking utility inventory stockpiles. During 2018, we expect domestic thermal coal markets to remain challenged. Long term, domestic thermal production and prices will continue to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices, coal fired power plant retirements and the availability of renewable generation.\nSoda Ash Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Soda Ash business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, international prices for soda ash, particularly in Asia, continued to be strong, and domestic prices have improved slightly over 2016. Income from this segment was slightly higher in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as the effect of the increased prices noted above were offset by temporary production issues that were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received distributions totaling $49.0 million.\nWe expect the international market to remain strong in 2018 as a result of continued strength in Asia and a smaller than expected impact from the new soda ash production capacity coming on line in Turkey. Prices, both internationally and domestically, are expected to remain around current levels during the year.\nConstruction Aggregates Business Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our Construction Aggregates business segment financial results included the following:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing cash flow used by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing cash flow used by continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DCF (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) See \"-Results of Operations\" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \nOur overall construction aggregates performance in the year ended December 31, 2017 improved compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher production and sales of crushed stone, gravel and sand, higher delivery and haul income and increased road construction and asphalt paving projects. Our construction aggregates business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves. In particular, key drivers of performance in the regions of our operations include: 1) natural gas drilling customers in the Marcellus shale, 2) traditional construction markets of Southwest Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, 3) energy-related and infrastructure spending in the Louisiana market, and 4) military spending in the Clarksville, Tennessee market.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Other Income\nRevenues and other income decreased $22.0 million, or 6%, from $400.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $378.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

revenues increased $19.0 million, or 19%, from $101.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Further discussion of the key drivers for the increase follows:\n \u2022 Appalachia: Coal royalty revenue increased $30.7 million as a result of increased metallurgical coal prices and production. \n \u2022 Illinois Basin: Lower production partially offset by higher royalty revenue per ton led to a $12.7 million decrease in coal royalty revenue. The decreased production was primarily a result of the temporary relocation of certain production off of NRP's coal reserves, which resulted in a $7.5 million increase in coal overriding royalty revenue and wheelage associated with the production of non-NRP coal. \nTotal other revenues decreased $28.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a $33.8 million decrease in minimums recognized as revenue due to certain lease modifications and terminations in the second quarter 2016 and a $5.3 million decrease in property tax reimbursements. However, the decrease in property tax revenue was fully offset by lower property tax expenses as described in operating and maintenance expenses below. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in coal override revenue as discussed above.\nGain on coal royalty and other segment asset sales decreased $25.5 million year-over-year primarily as a result of numerous asset sales completed during the year ended December 30, 2016.\nConstruction Aggregates\nThe table below presents the significant categories of Construction Aggregates revenues:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crushed stone, sand & gravel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delivery and fuel income\n</td> <td>38,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Road construction and asphalt paving\n</td> <td>18,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction aggregates revenues\n</td> <td>131,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset sales, net\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,292\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total construction aggregates revenues and other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and other income related to our Construction Aggregates segment increased $10.9 million, or 9%, from $120.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $131.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)\nOperating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) increased $6.0 million, or 5%, from $130.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $136.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily related to increased costs within our Construction Aggregates segment, partially offset by decreased costs within the Coal Royalty and Other segment.\n \u2022 Construction Aggregates segment costs increased $11.0 million, or 11% from $100.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $111.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily related to an increase in production costs, repairs and maintenance and labor costs due to the increase in production and sales as discussed above. \n \u2022 Coal Royalty and Other segment costs decreased $5.0 million, or 17% from $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $24.9 million the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily related to $5.8 million lower property tax expense as a result of lower property tax rates and property tax values primarily in Kentucky and West Virginia and lower employee-related costs. \nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") Expense\nDD&A expense decreased $10.3 million, or 22%, from $46.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $36.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily driven by lower coal production in the Illinois Basin and $1.9 million lower depreciation expense of construction aggregate assets due to fully depreciated assets.\nGeneral and Administrative (\"G&A\") Expense (including affiliates)\nCorporate and financing G&A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs decreased $2.1 million, or 10%, from $20.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $18.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily due to decreased legal, consulting and advisory fees incurred in 2016 as a result of the recapitalization transactions completed in March 2017.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments decreased $13.9 million, or 82%, from $16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisted of certain coal, aggregates and timber properties. Asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of certain coal and hard mineral properties.\nInterest Expense (including affiliates)\nInterest expense (including affiliates) decreased $7.7 million, or 8%, from $90.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $82.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily related to lower debt balances during 2017 as a result of the recapitalization transactions entered into in March 2017.\nDebt Modification Expense\nDebt modification expense was $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and related to costs incurred as a result of the exchange of $241 million of our 2018 Senior Notes for 2022 Senior Notes in March 2017.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and related to the 4.563% premium paid to redeem the 2018 Senior Notes in April 2017.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased $2.2 million, from income of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of the sale of the discontinued non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nThe following table

the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of the following:\n \u2022 Coal Royalty and Other segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $28.2 million. While performance of our coal-related assets improved as described above, the prior year amount included $40.5 million of revenue resulting from one-time lease modifications and $25.5 million higher gains on asset sales. \n \u2022 Soda Ash segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million as a result of increased cash distributions received in the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Construction Aggregates segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Increased production and sales volume, increased marine terminal activity and higher margins on road construction and asphalt paving projects were offset by increased production costs and repairs and maintenance expenses. \n \u2022 Corporate and financing Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to legal and consulting fees related to the recapitalization activities incurred in 2016. \nSee \"Item 6.
