MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPreface\nIn preparing this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), we have taken into account all information available to us up to June 15, 2020, the date of this MD&A. The audited annual consolidated financial statements and this MD&A were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee and were approved and authorized for issuance by our Board of Directors on June 15, 2020.\nAll financial information contained in this annual MD&A and in the audited annual consolidated financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, except for certain non-GAAP information discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to file our audited consolidated financial statements with the SEC under IFRS without a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP and as a result, we do not prepare a reconciliation of our results to U.S. GAAP. It is possible that certain of our accounting policies could be different from GAAP. All monetary amounts in this MD&A are expressed in Canadian dollars, except for share and per share data and where otherwise indicated.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 and for the years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 which are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Update\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The measures adopted by the Federal, provincial and State governments in order to mitigate the spread of the outbreak required the Company to close all of its retail locations across North America effective March 17, 2020 until further notice.\nThe consequences of the outbreak and impact to the economy continues to evolve and the full extent of the impact is uncertain as of the date of this filing. As we continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business, we have taken decisive actions across our businesses such as temporarily furloughing all store related employees, moving all non-essential remaining employees to a four-day work week, reducing compensation for Board and management during the crisis. These measures, among others, are intended to better align the Company's cost structure with its current sales and help preserve its financial position.\nAlthough we continue to offer our products directly to consumers through our online store and in supermarkets and drugstores across Canada, there is no assurance that customers will purchase our products at previous volumes through these alternative channels. Furthermore, the duration and impact of the outbreak is unknown and may influence consumer shopping behavior and consumer demand including online shopping.\nAs retailers in North America begin to re-emerge from the government mandated lockdown, we are cautiously balancing the safety of our employees and customers with the desire to re-open select stores in our network. Accordingly, we have not remitted rental payments for the months of April, May and June at this time. We expect to test the re-opening of a few stores; however, until we have a clearer vision of how the pandemic unfolds, the impact of any government and landlord programs on our business, and the manner in which we address the operational constraints placed before us as part of government deconfinement measures, we expect to take a more cautious approach to store re-openings, and at this time, the Company is unable to predict when, and if, it will reopen its retail locations.\nFor the year ended February 1, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $31.2 million. The Company's current liabilities total $44.1 million as at February 1, 2020. As at February 1, 2020, the Company held cash and accounts and other receivables of $52.4 million. The Company does not currently have any third-party financing available with which to meet any future financial obligations.\nBased on its current projections, the Company has sufficient cash and accounts and other receivables to discharge its current liabilities in the next 12 months; however, it has experienced significant net losses in Fiscal Years 2017 to 2019 of $28.5 million, $33.5 million and $31.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to stabilize its business from unfavorable trend lines, strengthening its business by focusing on how to grow its product portfolio including sales and customer service execution, and effectively optimizing its North American retail footprint to emerge as a leaner, more sustainable physical presence that complements a growing world-class online and grocery business, all supported by a right-sized support organization.\nManagement believes that there is material uncertainty surrounding the Company's ability to execute the strategy necessary to return to profitability in the current environment, including the unpredictability surrounding the recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak and changes in consumer behavior. If the Company is unable to execute these or other related strategies, the Board of Directors of the Company may pursue a formal restructuring, reorganization or other similar actions under applicable Canadian and/or United States laws.\nAs of June 15, 2020, we have received notices of default for unpaid rents from 37 landlords representing 53 of our retail stores. We also received rent deferral notices from 13 landlords representing 60 of our retail stores. With regard to both the defaulted leases and rent deferral notices, we have either determined to terminate the lease or are in the process of discussing resolution of the current situation regarding rent payments with the landlords. We can provide no assurances that an agreement or resolution regarding the defaulted leases will be reached or any forbearance of our lease obligations will be provided to us regarding our other lease agreements.\nAccounting Periods\nAll references to Fiscal 2019\u201d are to the Company's fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. All references to Fiscal 2018\u201d are to the Company's fiscal year ended February 2, 2019.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. The years ended February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 covers a 52-week fiscal period.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>36 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories, and food and beverages primarily through 231 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of February 1, 2020, and our website, davidstea.com. We are building a brand that seeks to expand the definition of tea with innovative products that consumers can explore in an open and inviting retail environment. We strive to make tea a multi-sensory experience by facilitating interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us and may pose risks and challenges, as discussed in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal 2020 Highlights\nDuring Fiscal 2019, sales declined by $16.3 million and 8% over the prior year to $196.5 million. Net loss decreased by $2.3 million to $31.2 million for the year from a net loss of $33.5 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, net loss would have amounted to $35.4 million representing a increase of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA in Fiscal 2019 was of $11.1 million and compares to a loss of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA would have amounted to a negative $11.9 million, representing a decrease of $10.3 million.\nHow We Assess Our Performance\nThe key measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business and the execution of our strategy are set forth below:\nSales. Sales consist primarily of sales from our retail stores, e-commerce site and our wholesale distribution channels. Our business is seasonal and, as a result, our sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Sales are traditionally highest in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday sales period, and tend to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarter because of lower customer traffic in our locations in the summer months.\nThe specialty retail industry is cyclical, and our sales are affected by general economic conditions. A number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence can affect purchases of our products.\nSales also include gift card breakage income.\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales refer to year-over-year comparison information for comparable stores. Our stores are added to the comparable sales calculation in the beginning of their thirteenth month of operation. As a result, data regarding comparable sales may not be comparable to similarly titled data from other retailers.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>37 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our business is performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to consumer preference, buying and economic trends;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to provide a product offering that generates new and repeat visits to our stores and online;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the customer experience we provide in our stores and online;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the level of customer traffic near our locations in which we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number of customer transactions and average ticket in our stores and online;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the pricing of our tea, tea accessories, and food and beverages;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to obtain and distribute product efficiently;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our opening of new stores in the vicinity of our existing stores; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the opening or closing of competitor stores near our stores.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Comparable Sales. Non-comparable sales include sales from stores prior to the beginning of their thirteenth fiscal month of operation and wholesale sales channel, which includes sales to grocery, hotels, restaurants and institutions, office and workplace locations and food services, as well as corporate gifting.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our sales less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes product costs, freight costs, store occupancy costs and distribution costs.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses. Selling, general and administration expenses consist of store operating expenses and other general and administration expenses, including store impairments, store recoveries and provision for onerous contracts. Store operating expenses consist of all store expenses. General and administration costs consist of salaries and other payroll costs, travel, professional fees, stock compensation, marketing expenses, information technology, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible, amortization of right-of-use assets and other operating costs.\nGeneral and administration costs, which are generally fixed in nature, do not vary proportionally with sales to the same degree as our cost of sales. We believe that these costs will decrease as a percentage of sales over time. Accordingly, this expense as a percentage of sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters.\nWe present Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses as a supplemental measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our selling, general and administration expenses under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. It is reconciled to its nearest IFRS measure Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults from Operating Activities. Results from operating activities consist of our gross profit less our selling, general and administration expenses.\nWe present adjusted results from operating activities as a supplemental measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. It is reconciled to its nearest IFRS measure in Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinance Costs. Finance costs consist of cash and imputed non-cash charges related to our credit facility, long-term debt, finance lease obligations, and interest on lease liabilities.\nFinance Income. Finance income consists of interest income on cash balances.\nProvision for Income Tax. Provision for income tax consists of federal, provincial, state and local current and deferred income taxes.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>38 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. Specifically, Adjusted EBITDA allows for an assessment of our operating performance and our ability to service or incur indebtedness without the effect of non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization, finance costs, deferred rent, non-cash compensation expense, costs and recoveries related to onerous contracts or contracts where we expect the costs of the obligations to exceed the economic benefit, gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets and certain non-recurring expenses. This measure also functions as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance. For a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, refer to Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelected Operating and Financial Highlights\nResults of Operations\nThe following

We believe that Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are not measurements of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with IFRS. We understand that although Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted

of Fiscal 2019 Compared to the Operating Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nSales. Sales decreased 11.6% to $73.5 million from $83.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018. Sales through e-commerce and wholesale channels increased $2.8 million and 18.5% driven primarily by greater online adoption in both Canada and the U.S., as well as by increased demand in our grocery chain distribution channel. Offsetting this was a decline in retail sales of $12.4 million, and a decline of $11.5 million and 17.3% in comparable same-store sales.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 1.2%, or $0.5 million, to $39.1 million for the three months ended February 1, 2020, from the prior year quarter. IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Accordingly, straight-line operating lease expense is no longer included in cost of sales in arriving at gross profit. Prior to the adoption of IFRS 16, straight-line operating lease expense amounting to $5.9 million would have been included in arriving at gross profit. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, gross profit decreased by $6.3 million to $33.2 million, representing a gross profit of 45.2% for the three months ended February 1, 2020, a decrease of 2.4% from the prior year quarter resulting from a shift in product sales mix and the deleveraging of fixed costs due to negative comparable store sales.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses increased by $4.0 million, or 10.2%, to $45.1 million for the three months ended February 1, 2020 from the prior year quarter. Under IFRS 16, SG&A includes $2.9 million of depreciation in connection with our right-of-use assets. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, SG&A would have amounted to $42.2 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 3.2%, from the prior year quarter and as a percentage of sales would have amounted to 57.3% representing an increase of 8.2% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets for the three months ended February 1, 2020 and the impact of onerous contracts, impairment of property, equipment, executive separation cost related to salary, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest and ERP project termination costs for the three months ended February 2, 2019, Adjusted SG&A increased by $0.3 million for the three months ended February 1, 2020. As a percentage of sales and excluding the impact of IFRS 16, Adjusted SG&A increased to 42.8% from 37.4% due to the decline in retail sales.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>45 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults from Operating Activities. Loss from operating activities was $6.0 million as compared to a loss of $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, loss from operating activities would have amounted to $8.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the prior year quarter. This increase is mainly explained by the increase in the impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets in 2019. Adjusted operating income, which excludes any impact of executive separation cost related to salary, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, impact from onerous contracts, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest, and ERP project termination, was $1.8 million compared to $8.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nFinance Costs. Finance costs remained stable at $1.4 million in the three months ended February 1, 2020 as compared to the prior year quarter. Finance costs under IFRS 16 includes interest expense from lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, and primarily due to the revision of an estimate for interest on an uncertain tax position, interest earnings of $0.3 million compares favorably to an expense of $1.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nFinance Income. Finance income of $0.2 million is derived primarily from interest on cash on hand and has increased slightly from prior year quarter.\nProvision (Recovery) for Income Tax. Recovery for income tax amounted to $1.5 million compared to a provision of $10.7 million in the prior year quarter. The recovery is due to the adjustment of the provision for uncertain tax provision taken in the prior year quarter. The provision taken in the prior year quarter was due primarily to a write-down of the deferred income tax assets and a provision for uncertain tax position.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, which excludes non-cash and other items in the current and prior periods, was negative $1.3 million in the quarter ended February 1, 2020 compared to a $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, EBITDA would have amounted to a negative $7.2 million, representing a decrease of $8.0 million over the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter amounted to $9.7 million compared to $10.9 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, stock-based compensation and loss on disposal of property and equipment for the three months ended February 1, 2020 and the impact of stock-based compensation, executive separation costs related to salary, impairment of property, equipment, onerous contracts, deferred rent, loss on disposal of property and equipment, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest, and ERP project termination costs for the three months ended February 2, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7.0 million to $3.9 million.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $5.7 million in the quarter ended February 1, 2020 compared to a net loss of $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, Net loss would have amounted to $7.0 million, representing a decrease in net loss of $6.3 million over the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact from executive separation cost related to salary, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, impact of onerous contracts, ERP project termination costs and costs related to strategic review and proxy contest, write-down of deferred income tax assets and the setup of deferred income tax assets resulting from the probability of using operating tax loss carry forwards, was $1.9 million compared to $6.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nFully Diluted Net Loss per Share. Fully diluted net loss per common share was $0.21 compared to a net loss of $0.51 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018. Adjusted fully diluted net income per common share, which is adjusted net income on a fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding basis, was $0.12 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the same quarter of prior year.\nCash on Hand. At the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company had cash amounting to $46.3 million. Our cash position enables us to execute our strategy and invest further in funding working capital, transformative technology improvements and related infrastructure.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>46 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended February 1, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2019\nSales. Sales for Fiscal 2019 decreased by 7.7%, or $16.3 million, to $196.5 million from $212.8 million in Fiscal 2018. Sales from our e-commerce and wholesale channels increased by $7.3 million and 20.9%, driven primarily by greater online adoption as well as by increased demand in our grocery distribution channel. Offsetting this was a decline in retail sales of $23.6 million and a decline of $22.1 million, or 12.7%, in comparable same-store sales.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased by 10.8% and $10.6 million, to $108.6 million in Fiscal 2019 in comparison to Fiscal 2018. IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Accordingly, straight-line operating lease expense is no longer included in cost of sales in arriving at gross profit. Prior to the adoption of IFRS 16, straight-line operating lease expense amounting to $23.2 million would have been included in arriving at gross profit. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, gross profit decreased by $12.6 million to $85.4 million, representing a gross profit of 43.5% for Fiscal 2019, a decrease of 2.6% compared to Fiscal 2018 driven by a shift in product sales mix and the deleveraging of fixed costs due to negative comparable store sales.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses. SG&A increased by 7.6% and $9.6 million, to $135.3 million in Fiscal 2019, compared to Fiscal 2018. Under IFRS 16, SG&A includes $12.1 million of depreciation in connection with our right-of-use assets. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, SG&A would have amounted to $123.3 million, a decrease of $2.5 million and 2.0%, from Fiscal 2018 and as a percentage of sales would have amounted to 62.7% representing an increase of 3.6% over Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets for Fiscal 2019 and the impact of executive separation cost related to salary, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, onerous contracts, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest and the ERP project termination for Fiscal 2018, Adjusted SG&A decreased by $2.3 million for Fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, Adjusted SG&A increased to 53.7% from 50.7% due to the decline in retail sales.\nResults from Operating Activities. Loss from operating activities was $26.7 million as compared to a loss of $27.7 million in the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, loss from operating activities would have amounted to $37.9 million, an increase of $10.1 million from the same period in 2018. This is mainly due to the impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets in 2019. Adjusted operating loss, which excludes any impact from executive separation costs related to salary, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, onerous contracts, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest, and ERP project terminations was $20.1 million compared to a loss of $9.9 million in the same period in the prior year, explained substantially by the decline in revenue compared to the prior year .\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, which excludes non-cash and other items in the current and prior periods, was negative $7.6 million in Fiscal 2019 compared to negative $19.5 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, EBITDA would have amounted to a negative $30.8 million, representing an increase of $11.3 million over Fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2019 amounted to $11.1 million compared to a negative $1.3 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, stock-based compensation and loss on disposal of property and equipment for Fiscal 2019 and the impact of stock-based compensation, executive separation costs related to salary, impairment of property and equipment, onerous contracts, loss on disposal of property and equipment, deferred rent, costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest, and ERP project termination for Fiscal 2018, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $10.8 million, to negative $12.1 million, and explained substantially by the decline in revenue compared to the prior year.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $31.2 million in Fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $33.5 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, Net loss would have amounted to $35.4 million, representing an increase of $1.9 million in net loss over Fiscal 2018. Adjusted net loss, which excludes the impact from executive separation cost related to salary, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets, impact of onerous contracts, ERP project termination costs and costs related to strategic review and proxy contest, write-down of deferred income tax assets and the setup of deferred income tax assets resulting from the probability of using operating tax loss carry forwards, was $19.4 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year period, and explained substantially by the decline in revenue compared to the prior year.\nFinance Costs. Finance costs amounted to $6.7 million in Fiscal 2019, an increase of $5.1 million from Fiscal 2018. Finance costs under IFRS 16 includes interest expense from lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The Company recognized a lease liability of $102.2 million on initial application of IFRS 16. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, interest expense would have been positive $0.3 million due to the adjustment on the interest and penalty on provision for uncertain tax position as compared to $1.6 million in Fiscal 2018.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>47 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Income. Finance income of $0.7 million in Fiscal 2019 is derived primarily from interest on cash on hand and has increased slightly from Fiscal 2018.\nProvision (Recovery) for Income Tax. Recovery for income tax amounted to $1.5 million compared to a provision of $4.9 million in Fiscal 2018. The recovery is due to the adjustment of the provision for uncertain tax provision taken in the prior year. Our effective tax rates were 4.9% and (17.0%) in Fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily from the write-down of prior year deferred income tax assets and an adjustment to the provision for uncertain tax position in the current year.\nNet Loss per Share. Fully diluted net loss per common share was $1.20 in Fiscal 2019 compared to $1.29 in Fiscal 2018. Adjusted fully diluted loss per common share, which is adjusted net loss on a fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding basis, was $0.58 per share in Fiscal 2019 compared to $0.26 per share in Fiscal 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at February 1, 2020, we had $46.3 million of cash primarily held by major Canadian financial institutions. Total current assets less the sum of trade and other payables and deferred revenue was $52.9 million and $65.8 million, for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash on hand. Our primary cash needs are to finance non-cash working capital, transformative investments in infrastructure and information technology and exiting leases on favorable terms.\nCapital expenditures typically vary depending on the timing of infrastructure-related and technology investments. During Fiscal 2019, capital expenditures totaled $3.6 million. We devoted approximately 72% of our capital expenditures to make continued investments in our technology infrastructure. The remainder of the capital expenditures was used to renovate and enhance existing stores.\nOur primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of store inventory and payment of payroll, rent and other store operating costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in the second and third fiscal quarters as we take title to increasing quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak selling season in the fourth fiscal quarter. We funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements from cash on hand and net cash provided by our operating activities.\nAlthough we generally anticipate that, based on our current forecasts, we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents meet our current and anticipated near-term needs, we are in the process of reevaluating our business and implementing new strategies. If we are unable to implement our strategies related to optimizing our North American retail footprint in order to decrease losses caused by unprofitable stores, decreasing our costs generally and accelerating the growth of our online store, our Board of Directors may pursue a formal restructuring, reorganization or other similar actions under applicable Canadian and/or United States laws.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>48 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is presented in the following table:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1, 2020\nExcluding impact\nof IFRS 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n2019 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) :\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,108 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,902 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,228 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,192 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,652 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,652 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,264 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,264 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,264 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,410 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,197 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,539 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Items not affecting cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,411 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,904 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,934 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,298 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of right-of-use assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,051 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,875 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,780 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,960 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on lease liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,962 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recovery for onerous contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,282 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>813 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion on provisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -

All commitments have been recorded in our consolidated balance sheets, except for purchase obligations. As at Feb 1, 2020, the Company has financial commitments in connection with the purchase of goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company, exclusive of additional amounts based on sales, taxes and other costs are payable in the amount of $11,450. The payments on these commitments are due in less than a year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements requires us to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements. Each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on our reported financial results. Estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and would materially impact our financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are discussed under Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\nRecoverability and impairment of non-financial assets\nNon-financial assets, including property and equipment, and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A review for impairment is conducted by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU's assets with their respective recoverable amounts based on value in use. Value in use is determined based on management's best estimate of expected future cash flows, which includes estimates of growth rates, from use over the remaining lease term and discounted using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (Note 8).\nEstimating the incremental borrowing rate of leases\nThe Company cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Company \u2018would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Company estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary's stand-alone credit rating).\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies\nWe believe the following are critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> i.\n</td> <td>Going concern uncertainty </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate and whether there are material uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, management must estimate future cash flows for a period of at least twelve months following the end of the reporting period by considering relevant available information about the future. In addition, management must make assumptions about what actions it will take to right-size the business. Given the inherent uncertainties, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's results of operations and cash flows is difficult to estimate, and required actions difficult to predict. Management has concluded that there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that raise substantial doubt upon the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> ii.\n</td> <td> Impairment of non-financial assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement is required to make significant judgments in determining if individual commercial premises in which it carries out its activities are individual CGUs, or if these units should be aggregated at a district or regional level to form a CGU. The significant judgments applied by management in determining if stores should be aggregated in a given geographic area to form a CGU include the determination of expected customer behavior, the allocation basis of e-commerce sales to CGUs, and whether customers could interchangeably shop in any of the stores in a given area and whether management views the cash inflows of the stores in the group as interdependent.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>51 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> iii.\n</td> <td> Income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company may be subject to audits related to tax risks, and uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to taxable income and income tax expense already recorded. The Company establishes provisions if required, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the entity and the responsible tax authority, which may arise on a wide variety of issues.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> iv.\n</td> <td>Determination of the lease term of leases with renewal options </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nThe Company has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms of three to five years. The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal, including store performance, expected future performance and past business practice. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16, Leases to make it easier for lessees to account for COVID-19-related rent concessions such as rent holidays and temporary rent reductions.\nThe amendment exempts lessees from having to consider individual lease contracts to determine whether rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are lease modifications and allows lessees to account for such rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications. It applies to COVID-19-related rent concessions that reduce lease payments due on or before 30 June 2021. The amendment does not affect lessors.\nThe amendment is effective as of June 1, 2020 but can be applied immediately in any financial statements-interim or annual-not yet authorised for issue. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on its financial statements.\nJOBS Act Exemptions and Foreign Private Issuer Status\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. This includes an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may take advantage of this exemption for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company if we (1) have US$1.07 billion or more in annual revenue as of the end of our fiscal year, (2) are a large accelerated filer and have more than US$700.0 million in market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates as of the end of our second fiscal quarter or (3) issue more than US$1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPreface\nIn preparing this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d), we have taken into account all information available to us up to June 15, 2020, the date of this MD&A. The audited annual consolidated financial statements and this MD&A were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee and were approved and authorized for issuance by our Board of Directors on June 15, 2020.\nAll financial information contained in this annual MD&A and in the audited annual consolidated financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, except for certain non-GAAP information discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to file our audited consolidated financial statements with the SEC under IFRS without a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP and as a result, we do not prepare a reconciliation of our results to U.S. GAAP. It is possible that certain of our accounting policies could be different from GAAP. All monetary amounts in this MD&A are expressed in Canadian dollars, except for share and per share data and where otherwise indicated.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 and for the years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 which are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Update\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The measures adopted by the Federal, provincial and State governments in order to mitigate the spread of the outbreak required the Company to close all of its retail locations across North America effective March 17, 2020 until further notice.\nThe consequences of the outbreak and impact to the economy continues to evolve and the full extent of the impact is uncertain as of the date of this filing. As we continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business, we have taken decisive actions across our businesses such as temporarily furloughing all store related employees, moving all non-essential remaining employees to a four-day work week, reducing compensation for Board and management during the crisis. These measures, among others, are intended to better align the Company's cost structure with its current sales and help preserve its financial position.\nAlthough we continue to offer our products directly to consumers through our online store and in supermarkets and drugstores across Canada, there is no assurance that customers will purchase our products at previous volumes through these alternative channels. Furthermore, the duration and impact of the outbreak is unknown and may influence consumer shopping behavior and consumer demand including online shopping.\nAs retailers in North America begin to re-emerge from the government mandated lockdown, we are cautiously balancing the safety of our employees and customers with the desire to re-open select stores in our network. Accordingly, we have not remitted rental payments for the months of April, May and June at this time. We expect to test the re-opening of a few stores; however, until we have a clearer vision of how the pandemic unfolds, the impact of any government and landlord programs on our business, and the manner in which we address the operational constraints placed before us as part of government deconfinement measures, we expect to take a more cautious approach to store re-openings, and at this time, the Company is unable to predict when, and if, it will reopen its retail locations.\nFor the year ended February 1, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $31.2 million. The Company's current liabilities total $44.1 million as at February 1, 2020. As at February 1, 2020, the Company held cash and accounts and other receivables of $52.4 million. The Company does not currently have any third-party financing available with which to meet any future financial obligations.\nBased on its current projections, the Company has sufficient cash and accounts and other receivables to discharge its current liabilities in the next 12 months; however, it has experienced significant net losses in Fiscal Years 2017 to 2019 of $28.5 million, $33.5 million and $31.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to stabilize its business from unfavorable trend lines, strengthening its business by focusing on how to grow its product portfolio including sales and customer service execution, and effectively optimizing its North American retail footprint to emerge as a leaner, more sustainable physical presence that complements a growing world-class online and grocery business, all supported by a right-sized support organization.\nManagement believes that there is material uncertainty surrounding the Company's ability to execute the strategy necessary to return to profitability in the current environment, including the unpredictability surrounding the recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak and changes in consumer behavior. If the Company is unable to execute these or other related strategies, the Board of Directors of the Company may pursue a formal restructuring, reorganization or other similar actions under applicable Canadian and/or United States laws.\nAs of June 15, 2020, we have received notices of default for unpaid rents from 37 landlords representing 53 of our retail stores. We also received rent deferral notices from 13 landlords representing 60 of our retail stores. With regard to both the defaulted leases and rent deferral notices, we have either determined to terminate the lease or are in the process of discussing resolution of the current situation regarding rent payments with the landlords. We can provide no assurances that an agreement or resolution regarding the defaulted leases will be reached or any forbearance of our lease obligations will be provided to us regarding our other lease agreements.\nAccounting Periods\nAll references to Fiscal 2019\u201d are to the Company's fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. All references to Fiscal 2018\u201d are to the Company's fiscal year ended February 2, 2019.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. The years ended February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 covers a 52-week fiscal period.\n\nOverview\nWe are a branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories, and food and beverages primarily through 231 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of February 1, 2020, and our website, davidstea.com. We are building a brand that seeks to expand the definition of tea with innovative products that consumers can explore in an open and inviting retail environment. We strive to make tea a multi-sensory experience by facilitating interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us and may pose risks and challenges, as discussed in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal 2020 Highlights\nDuring Fiscal 2019, sales declined by $16.3 million and 8% over the prior year to $196.5 million. Net loss decreased by $2.3 million to $31.2 million for the year from a net loss of $33.5 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, net loss would have amounted to $35.4 million representing a increase of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA in Fiscal 2019 was of $11.1 million and compares to a loss of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA would have amounted to a negative $11.9 million, representing a decrease of $10.3 million.\nHow We Assess Our Performance\nThe key measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business and the execution of our strategy are set forth below:\nSales. Sales consist primarily of sales from our retail stores, e-commerce site and our wholesale distribution channels. Our business is seasonal and, as a result, our sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Sales are traditionally highest in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday sales period, and tend to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarter because of lower customer traffic in our locations in the summer months.\nThe specialty retail industry is cyclical, and our sales are affected by general economic conditions. A number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence can affect purchases of our products.\nSales also include gift card breakage income.\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales refer to year-over-year comparison information for comparable stores. Our stores are added to the comparable sales calculation in the beginning of their thirteenth month of operation. As a result, data regarding comparable sales may not be comparable to similarly titled data from other retailers.\n\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our business is performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:\n\nNon-Comparable Sales. Non-comparable sales include sales from stores prior to the beginning of their thirteenth fiscal month of operation and wholesale sales channel, which includes sales to grocery, hotels, restaurants and institutions, office and workplace locations and food services, as well as corporate gifting.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our sales less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes product costs, freight costs, store occupancy costs and distribution costs.\nSelling, General and Administration Expenses. Selling, general and administration expenses consist of store operating expenses and other general and administration expenses, including store impairments, store recoveries and provision for onerous contracts. Store operating expenses consist of all store expenses. General and administration costs consist of salaries and other payroll costs, travel, professional fees, stock compensation, marketing expenses, information technology, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible, amortization of right-of-use assets and other operating costs.\nGeneral and administration costs, which are generally fixed in nature, do not vary proportionally with sales to the same degree as our cost of sales. We believe that these costs will decrease as a percentage of sales over time. Accordingly, this expense as a percentage of sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters.\nWe present Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses as a supplemental measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our selling, general and administration expenses under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. It is reconciled to its nearest IFRS measure Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults from Operating Activities. Results from operating activities consist of our gross profit less our selling, general and administration expenses.\nWe present adjusted results from operating activities as a supplemental measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. It is reconciled to its nearest IFRS measure in Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinance Costs. Finance costs consist of cash and imputed non-cash charges related to our credit facility, long-term debt, finance lease obligations, and interest on lease liabilities.\nFinance Income. Finance income consists of interest income on cash balances.\nProvision for Income Tax. Provision for income tax consists of federal, provincial, state and local current and deferred income taxes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. Specifically, Adjusted EBITDA allows for an assessment of our operating performance and our ability to service or incur indebtedness without the effect of non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization, finance costs, deferred rent, non-cash compensation expense, costs and recoveries related to onerous contracts or contracts where we expect the costs of the obligations to exceed the economic benefit, gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets and certain non-recurring expenses. This measure also functions as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance. For a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, refer to Part II - Item 7, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelected Operating and Financial Highlights\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the period indicated:\n _____________\n (1) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income see -Non-IFRS Metrics\u201d below. (2) Comparable sales refer to year-over-year comparison information for comparable stores and e-commerce. Our stores are added to the comparable sales calculation in the beginning of their thirteenth month of operation. \n\nNon-IFRS Metrics\nAdjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, and the use of the term Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss), before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. We believe that Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are not measurements of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with IFRS. We understand that although Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\n \u00b7 Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Selling, General and Administration expenses, Adjusted results from Operating Activities, Adjusted EBITDA, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, to our net loss, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Fully Diluted Income (Loss) per common share determined in accordance with IFRS:\n\nReconciliation of Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses\n ___________  (a) Executive and employee separation costs represent salary owed to certain former executives and employees payable as part of their separation of employment from the Company (b) Represents costs related to impairment of property, equipment and right-of-use assets for stores and intangible assets. (c) Represents provision, non-cash reversals, and utilization related to certain stores where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the lease agreements are expected to exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract. (d) Represents costs related to a corporate strategic review process as well as costs related to the proxy contest which culminated at the Company's annual meeting held on June 14, 2018. Costs for the three and twelve months ended February 2, 2019 includes $13 and $825, respectively, related to the strategic review process, nil and $868 for incremental directors and officers run-off insurance costs incurred prior to the annual meeting on June 14, 2018, and $42 and $1,900, respectively, for costs incurred in connection with the proxy contest, including nil and $957, respectively, paid to Rainy Day Investments Ltd., a controlling shareholder, for third-party costs incurred by it, as approved by the independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company. (e) Represents cost incurred during the year to organize and establish project requirements and enterprise design that will not be reusable when the company decides to embark on future ERP initiatives. \n\nReconciliation of Adjusted results from operating activities\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

We believe that Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are not measurements of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with IFRS. We understand that although Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\n \u00b7 Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and \u00b7 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Selling, General and Administration expenses, Adjusted results from Operating Activities, Adjusted EBITDA, before and after adjustments for the impact of IFRS 16, to our net loss, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Fully Diluted Income (Loss) per common share determined in accordance with IFRS:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40
