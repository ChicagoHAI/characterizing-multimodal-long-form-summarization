Strategically located adjacent to CVR Refining's refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility is the only operation in North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Refer to Part 1, Item 1 \"Business\" of this Report for detailed information on our business.\nPending Mergers\nOn August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. (\"Rentech Nitrogen\") and Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC (\"Rentech Nitrogen GP\"), pursuant to which CVR Partners would acquire Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP by merging two newly-created direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners with and into those entities with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners (together, the mergers\u201d). In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805-Business Combinations, the Partnership anticipates accounting for the mergers as an acquisition of a business with CVR Partners as the acquirer. Refer to Note 1 (\"Formation of the Partnership, Organization and Nature of Business\") of Part II. Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of the mergers.\nMajor Influences on Results of Operations\nOur earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, on-stream factors and direct operating expenses. Natural gas is the most significant raw material required in our competitors' production of nitrogen fertilizer. Unlike our competitors, we do not use natural gas as a feedstock and use a\nminimal amount of natural gas as an energy source in our operations. Instead, CVR Refining's adjacent refinery supplies us with most of the pet coke feedstock we need pursuant to a 20 year pet coke supply agreement entered into in October 2007. The price at which our products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nAs a result of a favorable global demand environment for grains, nitrogen fertilizer prices rose to near historic levels beginning in 2011. In addition, North American producers began to benefit from lower natural gas prices due to the significant increase in shale basin and other non-conventional production in the region. The combination of higher nitrogen fertilizer prices globally and a feedstock cost advantage led to high margins for North American nitrogen fertilizer producers. This resulted in numerous announcements for expansion plans for existing plants as well as new facility development in the corn belt and the gulf coast. The majority of the additional supply from this expansion phase in North America is expected to come online in 2016. We expect product pricing may experience volatility as the new supply displaces imports into the gulf coast and corn belt. However, over the longer-term the U.S. is expected to remain a net importer of nitrogen fertilizer with domestic prices influenced by the higher cost of imported tons into the U.S.\nSince mid-2013, global nitrogen fertilizer prices have trended down as global grain supply increased and growth in grain demand slowed due to more challenging worldwide economic considerations. During 2015, there were announced transactions for further consolidation in the North American nitrogen fertilizer market, including our definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire all outstanding units of Rentech Nitrogen. Refer to Note 1 (\"Formation of the Partnership, Organization and Nature of Business\") of Part II. Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of the mergers.\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the longer-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. We view the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve will continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S.\nIn order to assess our operating performance, we calculate the product pricing at gate as an input to determine our operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. We believe product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because we sell products at our plant gate and terminal locations' gates (sold gate) and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site (sold delivered). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.\nWe and other competitors in the U.S. farm belt share a significant transportation cost advantage when compared to our out-of-region competitors in serving the U.S. farm belt agricultural market; therefore we are able to cost-effectively sell substantially all of our products in the higher margin agricultural market. Further, we believe that a significant portion of our competitors' revenues are derived from the lower margin industrial market. Our products leave the plant either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. We do not currently incur significant intermediate transfer, storage, barge freight or pipeline freight charges; however, we do incur costs to maintain and repair our railcar fleet. Selling products to customers within economic rail transportation limits of the nitrogen fertilizer plant and keeping transportation costs low are keys to maintaining profitability.\nAs a result of the UAN expansion project completed in 2013, we will continue to upgrade substantially all of our ammonia production into UAN for as long as it makes economic sense to do so. The value of nitrogen fertilizer products is also an important consideration in understanding our results. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we upgraded approximately 96% and 97%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that presently generates greater profit than ammonia.\nThe high fixed cost of our direct operating expense structure also directly affects our profitability. Our facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. Major fixed operating expenses include a large portion of electrical energy, employee labor, maintenance, including contract labor,\nand outside services. We estimate these fixed costs averaged approximately 80% of direct operating expenses over the 24 months ended December 31, 2015.\nOur largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which we purchase from CVR Refining and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred approximately $11.9 million, $13.6 million and $14.6 million, respectively, for pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of $25, $28 and $30, respectively.\nConsistent, safe, and reliable operations at our nitrogen fertilizer plant are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. Unplanned downtime of the plant may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a temporary increase in working capital investment and related inventory position. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is mitigated through a diligent planning process that takes into account margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance, feedstock logistics and other factors. Historically, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has undergone a full facility turnaround approximately every two to three years. Turnarounds are expected to last 14-21 days. A less involved facility shutdown was performed during the second quarter of 2014 and included both the installation of a waste heat boiler and the completion of several key tasks in order to upgrade the pressure swing adsorption unit. The Partnership underwent a full facility turnaround in the third quarter of 2015, and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each at a cost, exclusive of the impacts due to the lost production during the downtime, of approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Partnership is planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround in the second half of 2017.\nAgreements with CVR Energy and CVR Refining\nWe are party to several agreements with CVR Energy and its affiliates that govern the business relations among us, CVR Energy and its subsidiaries (including CVR Refining, and our general partner). These include the pet coke supply agreement under which we buy the pet coke we use in our nitrogen fertilizer plant; a services agreement, under which CVR Energy and its affiliates provide us with management services including the services of its senior management team; a feedstock and shared services agreement, which governs the provision of feedstocks, including, but not limited to, hydrogen, high-pressure steam, nitrogen, instrument air, oxygen and natural gas; a raw water and facilities sharing agreement, which allocates raw water resources between the two businesses; an easement agreement; an environmental agreement; and a lease agreement pursuant to which we lease office space and laboratory space. These agreements were not the result of arm's length negotiations and the terms of these agreements are not necessarily as favorable to the parties to these agreements as terms which could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See Note 14 (\"Related Party Transactions\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional discussion of the agreements.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below.\n2015 Turnaround\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the nitrogen fertilizer facility completed a major scheduled turnaround and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately $7.0 million associated with the 2015 turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLinde Air Separation Unit Related Downtime\nLinde owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to our facility. During the third quarter of 2015, the Linde air separation unit experienced downtime, in excess of the downtime associated with the major scheduled turnaround discussed above, that resulted in the gasification, ammonia and UAN units being down for between 16 to 19 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIndustry Factors\nGlobal demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by population growth, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association, from 1973 to 2013, global fertilizer demand grew 1.9% annually. Fertilizer use is projected to increase by 45% between 2005 and 2030 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. As an example, China's wheat and coarse grains production increased 51% between 2005 and 2015, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its imports by more than 200% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\").\nWorld grain demand increased 9% from 2012 to 2015, according to the USDA, leading to a tighter grain supply environment and significant increases in grain prices that is supportive of fertilizer prices.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices have decoupled from their historical correlation with natural gas prices and are now driven primarily by demand dynamics. At existing grain prices and prices implied by futures markets, farmers are expected to generate profits leading to relatively inelastic demand for fertilizers.\nThe United States is the world's largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 33% of world exports and 29% of world production during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year, according to the USDA. Fertecon estimates the United States is the world's third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and historically the world's first or second largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer, importing approximately 42% of its nitrogen fertilizer needs during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year. North American producers have a significant and sustainable cost advantage over the majority of producers that export to the U.S. market.\nThe three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the U.S. are ammonia, urea and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe period to period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our consolidated financial statements. In order to effectively review and assess our historical financial information below, we have also included supplemental operating measures and industry measures that we believe are material to understanding our business.\nTo supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results.\nThe following tables summarize the financial data and key operating statistics for CVR Partners and our subsidiaries for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sold -

We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes expenses, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets and expenses associated with the pending Rentech Nitrogen mergers, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these expenses is discussed herein, so that investors have complete information about expenses. In addition, we believe that it is useful to exclude from Adjusted EBITDA non-cash share-based compensation, although it is a recurring cost incurred in the ordinary course of business. In our view, non-cash share-based compensation, which also is presented in our financial statements and discussed herein, reflects a non-cash cost which may obscure, for a given period, trends in the underlying business, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors\nand analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of our Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other financing costs, net\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Major scheduled turnaround expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation, non-cash\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses associated with the Rentech Nitrogen mergers\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(6)\n</td> <td>The board of directors of our general partner has a policy to calculate available cash for distribution starting with Adjusted EBITDA.

Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner.

The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Merger Agreement with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP includes customary restrictions on the conduct of the Partnership's business prior to the completion of the mergers, generally requiring the Partnership to conduct its business in the ordinary course and subjecting the Partnership to a variety of specified limitations. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, beginning with the distribution for the third quarter of 2015 and until the closing of the mergers, the Partnership may not make or declare distributions in excess of available cash for distribution in respect of any quarter.\nAvailable cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nA

Net sales were $289.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $298.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net sales decrease of $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of lower UAN sales prices ($11.6 million), lower UAN sales volumes ($3.3 million), and lower hydrogen sales prices ($0.3 million), partially offset by higher ammonia sales volumes ($4.2 million) and higher hydrogen sales volumes ($2.0 million). For the year ended December 31, 2015, UAN, ammonia and hydrogen made up $258.8 million, $17.2 million, and $11.8 million of our net sales, respectively. This compared to UAN, ammonia and hydrogen net sales of $273.7 million, $13.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The decrease in UAN sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially attributable to the 2015 turnaround and the Linde air separation unit related outages. The increase in ammonia sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially attributable to higher customer demand for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 90.2%, 87.5% and 87.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. On-stream factors for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProduct pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. Product pricing at gate for UAN decreased approximately 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Product pricing at gate for ammonia increased approximately 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCost of Product Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes cost of freight and distribution expenses, pet coke expenses, purchased ammonia and purchased hydrogen. Cost of product sold excluding depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $65.2 million, compared to $72.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.8 million decrease resulted from $4.1 million in lower costs from transactions with affiliates and a decrease in costs from transactions with third parties of $2.7 million. The lower affiliate costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily the result of lower consumption of CVR Refining pet coke mostly due to price and also due to the decrease in production during the turnaround and the Linde air separation unit related downtime. The lower third-party costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of decreased distribution costs, freight expenses and purchased ammonia, partially offset by higher expenses associated with third-party coke expenses and other product costs. The lower distribution costs is due to a smaller portion of our fleet due for regulatory inspections and related repairs during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of energy and utility costs, direct costs of labor, property taxes, plant-related maintenance services and environmental and safety compliance costs as well as catalyst and chemical costs. Direct operating\nexpenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $106.1 million, as compared to $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The total increase of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was comprised of a $6.1 million increase in costs from transactions with third parties and a $1.1 million increase in direct operating costs from affiliates. The increase in costs from transactions with third parties resulted primarily from higher turnaround expenses ($7.0 million), personnel ($2.9 million), repairs and maintenance other than turnaround expenses ($2.2 million), and other less significant increases, partially offset by lower utilities, net ($2.3 million), refractory brick amortization ($2.2 million) and outside services ($1.8 million). The increase in personnel costs is partially attributable to the increased efforts required to complete activities during downtime. The increase in repairs and maintenance is due to the Partnership being able to perform an increased amount of normal repairs and maintenance during the downtime. The lower utilities, net are primarily due to lower usage during the turnaround and the Linde outages.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Selling, general and administrative expenses include the direct expenses of our business as well as certain expenses incurred by our affiliates, CVR Energy and its subsidiaries, on our behalf and billed or allocated to us in accordance with the services agreement. We also reimburse our general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement for expenses it incurs on our behalf, and such costs are recorded as expenses from affiliates. Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of an increase in costs from transactions with affiliates ($0.6 million) coupled with an increase in costs from transactions with third parties ($2.5 million). The overall variance was primarily the result of an increase in legal expenses and other outside services due to the Rentech Nitrogen pending mergers ($2.3 million) and an increase in personnel services ($0.7 million) primarily due to increased share based compensation and incentive awards during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet Income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $62.0 million, as compared to $76.1 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $14.1 million. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the factors noted above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet Sales. Net sales were $298.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $323.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net sales decrease of $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was the result of lower UAN sales prices ($25.8 million), lower ammonia sales volumes ($10.7 million), and lower ammonia sales prices ($3.0 million), partially offset by higher UAN sales volumes ($14.6 million). For the year ended December 31, 2014, UAN, ammonia and hydrogen made up $273.7 million, $13.1 million, and $10.1 million of our net sales, respectively. This compared to UAN, ammonia and hydrogen net sales of $284.9 million, $26.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and sales price for UAN, ammonia and hydrogen for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Volume(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ per ton(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales $(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ per ton(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales $(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales $(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>951,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>904,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia\n</td> <td>24,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydrogen\n</td> <td>996,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,165,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168,784\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>UAN and ammonia sales volumes are in tons.

The increase in UAN and decrease in ammonia sales\nvolumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was partially attributable to the UAN expansion being available for the full period in 2014. On-stream factors (total number of hours operated divided by total hours in the reporting period) for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 96.8%, 92.6% and 92.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. On-stream factors for the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were 95.6%, 94.4% and 91.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nProduct pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. Product pricing at gate prices for UAN decreased approximately 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Product pricing at gate for ammonia decreased approximately 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCost of Product Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes cost of freight and distribution expenses, pet coke expenses, purchased ammonia, and purchased hydrogen. Cost of product sold excluding depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $72.0 million, compared to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The $13.9 million increase resulted from $15.3 million in higher costs from transactions with third parties, which is offset by lower costs from transactions with affiliates of $1.4 million. The higher third-party costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily the result of increased distribution costs ($10.5 million) mostly due to the increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs as well as increased ammonia purchases ($6.5 million), partially offset by lower freight and pet coke expenses. The increase in railcar regulatory inspections and repairs is related to a larger portion of our fleet due for regulatory inspections and related repairs during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year.\nDirect Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of energy and utility costs, direct costs of labor, property taxes, plant-related maintenance services and environmental and safety compliance costs as well as catalyst and chemical costs. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $98.9 million, as compared to $94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The total increase of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was comprised of a $5.9 million increase in costs from transactions with third parties, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in direct operating costs from affiliates. The increase resulted primarily from higher utilities, net ($1.3 million), refractory brick amortization ($2.7 million), repairs and maintenance ($1.2 million), partially offset by lower insurance costs ($1.1 million). The increased utility costs were largely due to higher electrical and natural gas prices, partially offset by lower electrical volumes. The increase in refractory brick amortization is primarily due to a decrease in the estimated useful life to reflect higher estimated rates of use in our production process.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Selling, general and administrative expenses include the direct expenses of our business as well as certain expenses incurred by our affiliates, CVR Energy and its subsidiaries, on our behalf and billed or allocated to us in accordance with the services agreement. We also reimburse our general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement for expenses it incurs on our behalf, and such costs are recorded as expenses from affiliates. Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was the result of a decrease in costs from transactions with affiliates ($2.6 million) coupled with a decrease in costs from transactions with third parties ($0.7 million). The overall variance was primarily the result of a decrease in reimbursements to our general partner ($1.7 million), a decrease in outside services ($1.2 million) and a decrease in share-based compensation ($1.0 million), partially offset by increases in expenses related to personnel costs ($0.4 million), exclusive of share-based compensation.\nNet Income. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income was $76.1 million, as compared to $118.6 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $42.5 million. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the factors noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations, which can include cash advances from customers resulting from forward sales. Our principal uses of cash are funding our operations, distributions to common unitholders, capital expenditures and funding our debt service obligations.\nWe expect to assume additional indebtedness, some of which or all that will require short-term repayment, in connection with consummating the mergers as discussed below under \"Merger-Related Financing Arrangements.\"\nAs discussed in Note 9 (\"Credit Facility\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report, the Partnership's credit facility matures in April 2016. On February 9, 2016, Coffeyville Resources, LLC (\"CRLLC\") and the Partnership entered into a guaranty, pursuant to which CRLLC agreed to guaranty the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility. See Note 9 (\"Credit Facility\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report for discussion of the guaranty. The principal portion of the existing term loan facility is presented as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 as the Partnership has the intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis.\nWe are considering various capital structure and refinancing options in regard to the credit facility and in contemplation of the Rentech Nitrogen mergers as discussed in \"Pending Mergers\". We anticipate these options will be adequate to fund the cash requirements of the maturing credit facility and the pending mergers.\nWe believe that our cash from operations, cash on hand and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, together with the options management is considering as discussed above, will be adequate to satisfy anticipated commitments and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, including commitments and expenditures associated with the consummation of the mergers. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and to secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors outside of our control.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further discussion of declared cash distributions is included below under \"Distributions to Unitholders\".\nCash Balance and Other Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $50.0 million, including $3.1 million of customer advances. As of December 31, 2014, we had $53.3 million in a money market account, which was classified as cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During 2015, the balance of the money market account was transferred to our operating cash account. The working capital at December 31, 2015 was $72.9 million, consisting of $98.8 million in current assets and $25.9 million in current liabilities. Working capital at December 31, 2014 was $89.9 million, consisting of $129.6 million in current assets and $39.7 million in current liabilities. As of February 16, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $67.0 million.\nCredit Facility\nOn April 13, 2011 in conjunction with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, we entered into a credit facility with a group of lenders including Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, as administrative and collateral agent. The credit facility includes a term loan facility of $125.0 million and a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million with an uncommitted incremental facility of up to $50.0 million. There is no scheduled amortization and the credit facility matures in April 2016, as discussed above. The principal portion of the existing term loan facility is presented as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 as the Partnership has the intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis. The credit facility is available to finance on-going working capital, capital projects, letter of credit issuances and general needs of the Partnership.\nBorrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by a trailing four quarter leverage ratio. Pricing for borrowings under the credit facility is currently based on the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of 3.50%, or, for base rate loans, the prime rate plus 2.50%. Under its terms, the lenders under the credit facility were granted a perfected, first priority security interest (subject to certain customary exceptions) in substantially all of the assets of CVR Partners and CRNF and all of the capital stock of CRNF and each domestic subsidiary owned by CVR Partners or CRNF. CRNF is the borrower under the credit facility. All obligations under the credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by CVR Partners and substantially all of our future, direct and indirect, domestic subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2015, no amounts were drawn under the $25.0 million revolving credit facility.\nMandatory Prepayments\nWe are required to prepay outstanding amounts under our term facility in an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of assets or from insurance or condemnation awards related to collateral, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights. In addition, we are required to prepay outstanding amounts under our term facility with the net proceeds from certain issuances of debt (other than debt permitted to be incurred under our credit facility).\nVoluntary Prepayments/Commitment Reductions\nAt any time, we may voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving commitment amount, or prepay, in whole or in part, outstanding amounts under our credit facility without premium or penalty other than customary \"breakage\" costs with respect to Eurodollar rate loans.\nAmortization and Final Maturity\nThere is no scheduled amortization under our credit facility. All outstanding amounts under our credit facility are due and payable in full in April 2016.\nRestrictive Covenants and Other Matters\nOur credit facility requires us to maintain (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter of 3.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter of 3.0 to 1.0, in both cases calculated on a trailing four quarter basis. In addition, the credit facility includes negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness, guarantees and other contingent obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur liens;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make negative pledges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends or make other distributions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make payments to our subsidiary;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain loans and investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into transactions with affiliates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The credit facility provides that we can make distributions to holders of our common units, but only if we are in compliance with our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any distribution and there is no default or event of default under the facility.\nThe credit facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, material judgments, actual or asserted failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the credit facility to be in force and effect, and change of control. An event of default will also be triggered if CVR Energy, CVR Refining or any of their subsidiaries (other than us and CRNF) terminates or violates any of its covenants in any of the intercompany agreements between us and CVR Energy, CVR Refining and their subsidiaries (other than us and CRNF) and such action has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on us. If an event of default occurs, the administrative agent under the credit facility would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility.\nMerger-Related Financing Arrangements\nSimultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, CVR Partners entered into a commitment letter (the \"commitment letter\") with Coffeyville Resources, LLC (\"CRLLC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy, pursuant to which CRLLC has committed to, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the commitment letter, make available to CVR Partners term loan financing of up to $150.0 million, which amounts would be available to solely fund the repayment of all of the loans outstanding under Rentech Nitrogen's existing $50.0 million credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation, the cash consideration payable by us upon closing of the mergers and transaction related expenses. We are considering various capital structure and refinancing options as an alternative to this financing arrangement. We anticipate these options will be adequate to fund the cash requirements for consummating the mergers.\nThe new term loan financing would be provided in the form of a one-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate maximum principal amount of up to $150.0 million. The full amount of the new term loan facility would only be available in a single draw and any amounts that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Optional repayments under the new term loan facility would be permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts to be agreed upon, without premium or penalty.\nThe new term loan facility would mature on the one year anniversary of the draw down under the facility. The term loan facility will bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year, and interest would be payable every three months.\nThe definitive documentation for the new term loan facility would contain terms, conditions, representations, warranties, covenants and events of default generally consistent with those contained in our existing credit facility, subject to the inclusion of such terms as are necessary or appropriate to give effect to or permit the consummation of the mergers. Borrowings under the new term loan facility would be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including: (i) execution of the definitive documentation; (ii) payment of any accrued costs, fees and expenses and other compensation payable to CRLLC as lender; (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties in the definitive documentation; (iv) consummation of the mergers; (v) prior or simultaneous repayment and cancellation of Rentech Nitrogen's existing $50.0 million credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation; and (vi) the delivery of other customary deliverables to the lender.\nRentech Nitrogen currently has $320.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.500% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\") outstanding. If we successfully complete the mergers, Rentech Nitrogen will be required under the indenture governing the Notes to offer to purchase, within 90 days of the mergers, all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase (the \"change of control offer\"). Apart from borrowings under our $125.0 million term loan facility and $25.0 million revolving credit facility and cash on hand, we have no available funds that we could provide to Rentech Nitrogen to fund the change of control offer, and we anticipate that Rentech Nitrogen would not have sufficient cash on hand for that purpose. We are considering various capital structure and refinancing options in association with funding the change of control offer. We anticipate these options will be adequate to fund the cash requirements for this obligation.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nOur profitability and cash flows are affected by changes in interest rates on our credit facility borrowings, specifically LIBOR and prime rates. The primary purpose of our interest rate risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate derivatives to convert some or all of the interest rates we pay on our borrowings from a floating rate to a fixed interest rate.\nWe have determined that the two interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2011 qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The impact recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is $1.1 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership recorded a decrease in fair market value on the interest rate swaps of $0.1 million, which was unrealized, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The combined fair market value of the interest rate swaps recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Partnership's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015 is $0.1 million. This amount is unrealized and, therefore, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCapital Spending\nOur total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $17.0 million. We divide our capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes only non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. We also treat maintenance capital spending as a reduction of cash available for distribution to unitholders. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity, improvement in product yields, and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. Of the $17.0 million spent for the year ended December 31, 2015, $9.6 million was related to maintenance capital projects and the remainder was related to growth capital projects. For the year ended December 31, 2015, capital expenditures were the result of various individually less significant projects. Major scheduled turnaround expenses as discussed in \"Major Influences on Results on Operations\" are expensed when incurred.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding production of UAN and acquiring additional infrastructure and production assets. We completed a significant two-year plant expansion in 2013 designed to increase our UAN production capacity by 400,000 tons, or approximately 50% per year. Total capital expenditures associated with the UAN expansion were approximately $130.0 million, excluding capitalized interest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we spent approximately $16.4 million on growth projects. Included in this amount was approximately $7.8 million for the purchase of railcars as disclosed in Note 14 (\"Related Party Transactions\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report and $3.2 million for the upgraded pressure swing adsorption unit (\"PSA\") as discussed in Major Influences on Results of Operations, with the remaining expenditures for other growth projects. Total capital expenditures for the purchased railcars was $8.7 million, which includes the $7.8 million spent during the year ended December 31, 2014 and an additional $0.9 million for costs to bring the purchased railcars to the condition and location necessary for its intended use during the year ended December 31, 2015. Total capital expenditures for the upgraded PSA unit was $4.2 million, which includes $0.5 million, $3.2 million and $0.5 million spent during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCapital spending for our business has been and will be determined by the Board of Directors of our general partner. Our current estimates for 2016 may change as a result of unforeseen circumstances and a change in our plans. These estimates may be revised from time to time or amounts may not be spent in the manner discussed herein. Our maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $7.0 to $10.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Planned capital expenditures for 2016 are subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects. For example, we may experience increases in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of our nitrogen fertilizer plant.\n2015 Turnaround\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the nitrogen fertilizer facility completed a major scheduled turnaround and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately $7.0 million, associated with the 2015 turnaround, are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nThe board of directors of the Partnership's general partner has a policy for the Partnership to distribute all available cash generated on a quarterly basis. The merger agreement includes certain limitations on cash distributions. These limitations and our policy is disclosed in Note 6 (\"Partners' Capital and Partnership Distributions\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report. The following is a summary of cash distributions paid to unitholders during 2015 for the respective quarters to which the distributions relate:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Cash\nDistributions\nPaid in 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except per common unit amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount paid to CRLLC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts paid to public unitholders\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amount paid\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per common unit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common units outstanding (in thousands)\n</td> <td>73,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 17, 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 in the amount of $0.27 per common unit, or $19.7 million in aggregate. The cash distribution will be paid on March 7, 2016 to the Partnership's unitholders of record at the close of business on February 29, 2016. Total cash distributions paid and to be paid based upon available cash for 2015 were $1.11 per common unit.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(91.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nFor purposes of this cash flow discussion, we define trade working capital as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Other working capital is defined as all other current assets and liabilities except trade working capital.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $78.4 million. Fluctuations in trade working capital decreased our operating cash flow by $3.6 million due to an increase in inventory of $1.9 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $1.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $0.1 million. Fluctuations in other working capital of $11.5 million decreased our operating cash flow and were due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $10.5 million, a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.2 million, partially offset by a decrease to prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately $2.2 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to lower market demand for prepaid contracts for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases in balances related to accrued railcar regulatory inspections of $2.6 million due to a larger portion of our fleet due for regulatory inspections and repairs during 2014. The decrease in prepaid expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in intercompany amounts due from Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC (\"CRRM\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Refining, that include the transfer of hydrogen, the timing of insurance payments and other less significant changes.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $118.9 million. Fluctuations in trade working capital decreased our operating cash flow by $7.1 million due to a decrease in accounts payable of $5.0 million and an increase in inventory of approximately $2.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.4 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to the decrease in intercompany obligations and a decrease due to normal fluctuations in the timing of regular payments. Fluctuations in other working capital increased our operating cash flows by approximately $19.6 million due an increase in deferred revenue of $12.9 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.6 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.1 million. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to higher market demand for prepaid contracts for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior period. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued railcar regulatory inspections and repairs of $3.3 million and an increase in accrued intercompany charges of $2.0 million, partially offset by other changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The decrease to prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily attributable to a decrease in prepaid insurance due to lower insurance premiums and a decrease in intercompany amounts due from CRRM that include the transfer of hydrogen.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $129.0 million. Fluctuations in trade working capital decreased our operating cash flow by $5.3 million due to an increase in inventory of $4.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.5 million. The increase in inventory was primarily attributable to $3.6 million of lower finished goods inventory the end of 2012 attributable to the turnaround as compared to 2013 and the purchase of precious metals of $1.7 million in connection with the UAN expansion, partially offset by a decrease in parts and supplies. Fluctuations in other working capital decreased operating cash flows by $13.2 million due to an increase to prepaid expense of $7.8 million and a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $5.1 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.3 million. The increase to prepaid expense was primarily attributable to the increase prepaid insurance due to a change from monthly to annual insurance payments and due to an increase in intercompany amounts due for hydrogen. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $5.1 million is primarily due to lower property tax in connection with the property tax settlement.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $16.9 million, $21.0 million and $43.7 million, respectively, and were primarily the result of capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2015, capital expenditures were the result of various individually less significant projects. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of railcars, maintenance capital projects and the upgraded PSA unit of approximately $7.8 million, $4.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily related to the UAN expansion that contributed approximately $24.3 million in capital expenditures during the period.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $91.4 million, $103.1 million and $128.0 million, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were primarily attributable to quarterly cash distributions of $91.4 million, $103.1 million and $127.5 million, respectively.\nCapital and Commercial Commitments\nWe are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. See Note 13 (\"Commitments and Contingencies\") in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information. The following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2015 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations with third parties and affiliates and interest payments for the five years ending December 31, 2020 and thereafter.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations with third parties (3)\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations with affiliates (4)\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (5)\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The credit facility included a $125.0 million term loan and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility.

This security may not exceed an amount equal to 21 times the average daily dollar value of pet coke we purchase for the 90-day period preceding the date on which CRRM gives us notice that it has deemed that a material adverse change has occurred. Unless otherwise agreed by CRRM and us, we can provide such security by means of a standby or documentary letter of credit, prepayment, a surety instrument, or a combination of the foregoing. If we do not provide such security, CRRM may require us to pay for future deliveries of pet coke on a cash-on-delivery basis. If we fail to pay for such deliveries on a cash-on-delivery basis, CRRM may suspend delivery of pet coke until such security is provided and terminate the agreement upon 30 days' prior written notice. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement within 60 days of providing security, so long as we provide five days' prior written notice.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to make distributions, to fund planned capital expenditures and to satisfy our other capital and commercial commitments will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to nitrogen fertilizer margins, natural gas prices and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us under our credit facility or any replacement credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions, finance necessary capital expenditures, service our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" above for further discussion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any \"off-balance sheet arrangements\" as such term is defined within the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the Partnership.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In order to apply these principles, management must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. Our accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Our critical accounting policies, which are described below, could materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets. When assets are placed in service, we estimate what we believe are their reasonable useful lives. We account for impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (\"ASC 360\"). In accordance with ASC 360, the Partnership reviews long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. No impairment charges were recognized for any of the periods presented.\nGoodwill\nTo comply with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually, or more frequently in the event we determine that a triggering event has occurred. Our annual testing is performed as of November 1 of each year. In accordance with ASC 350, the Partnership may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the two-step quantitative impairment test is required. If the Partnership elects to perform a qualitative assessment, the two-step impairment test is required only if the Partnership concludes that is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. For the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership elected to perform a qualitative assessment.\nWe began the qualitative assessment by analyzing the key drivers and other external factors that impact our business in order to determine if any significant events, transactions or other factors had occurred or are expected to occur that would impair our earnings or competitiveness therefore impairing the fair value of the Partnership. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, it was determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the Partnership was less than the carrying value, and so it was not necessary to perform the two-step valuation. The key drivers that were considered in the evaluation of the Partnership's fair value included:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general economic conditions,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fertilizer pricing,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>input costs,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>liquidity and capital resources, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>customer outlook.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue Recognition\nRevenues for products sold are recorded upon delivery of the products to customers, which is the point at which title is transferred, the customer has the assumed risk of loss, and when payment has been received or collection is reasonably assured.\nSales are recognized when the product is delivered and all significant obligations of the Partnership have been satisfied. Deferred revenue represents customer prepayments under contracts to guarantee a price and supply of nitrogen fertilizer in quantities expected to be delivered in the next 12 months in the normal course of business. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in reported revenues. Pass-through finished goods delivery costs reimbursed by customers are reported in net sales, while an offsetting expense is included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).\nAllocation of Costs\nOur consolidated financial statements include an allocation of costs that have been incurred by CVR Energy or CRLLC on our behalf. The allocation of such costs is governed by the services agreement entered into by CVR Energy and us and affiliated companies in October 2007 and subsequently amended. The services agreement provides guidance for the treatment of certain general and administrative expenses and certain direct operating expenses incurred on our behalf. Such expenses incurred include, but are not limited to, salaries, benefits, share-based compensation expense, insurance, accounting, tax, legal and technology services.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Partnership uses forward swap contracts primarily to reduce the exposure to changes in interest rates on its debt and to provide a cash flow hedge. These derivative instruments have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, these instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, at each reporting period end. The actual measurement of the cash flow hedge ineffectiveness will be recognized in earnings, if applicable. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"), in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nOther financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, as a result of the short-term nature of the instruments.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Partnership records share-based compensation related to the CVR Partners, LP Long Term Incentive Plan, and we have been allocated share-based compensation expense from CVR Energy and CRLLC. The Partnership accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"). ASC 718 requires that compensation costs relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in a company's financial statements. ASC 718 applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also may apply to liabilities an entity incurs for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the company.

Strategically located adjacent to CVR Refining's refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility is the only operation in North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Refer to Part 1, Item 1 \"Business\" of this Report for detailed information on our business.\nPending Mergers\nOn August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. (\"Rentech Nitrogen\") and Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC (\"Rentech Nitrogen GP\"), pursuant to which CVR Partners would acquire Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP by merging two newly-created direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners with and into those entities with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners (together, the mergers\u201d). In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805-Business Combinations, the Partnership anticipates accounting for the mergers as an acquisition of a business with CVR Partners as the acquirer. Refer to Note 1 (\"Formation of the Partnership, Organization and Nature of Business\") of Part II. Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of the mergers.\nMajor Influences on Results of Operations\nOur earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, on-stream factors and direct operating expenses. Natural gas is the most significant raw material required in our competitors' production of nitrogen fertilizer. Unlike our competitors, we do not use natural gas as a feedstock and use a\nminimal amount of natural gas as an energy source in our operations. Instead, CVR Refining's adjacent refinery supplies us with most of the pet coke feedstock we need pursuant to a 20 year pet coke supply agreement entered into in October 2007. The price at which our products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nAs a result of a favorable global demand environment for grains, nitrogen fertilizer prices rose to near historic levels beginning in 2011. In addition, North American producers began to benefit from lower natural gas prices due to the significant increase in shale basin and other non-conventional production in the region. The combination of higher nitrogen fertilizer prices globally and a feedstock cost advantage led to high margins for North American nitrogen fertilizer producers. This resulted in numerous announcements for expansion plans for existing plants as well as new facility development in the corn belt and the gulf coast. The majority of the additional supply from this expansion phase in North America is expected to come online in 2016. We expect product pricing may experience volatility as the new supply displaces imports into the gulf coast and corn belt. However, over the longer-term the U.S. is expected to remain a net importer of nitrogen fertilizer with domestic prices influenced by the higher cost of imported tons into the U.S.\nSince mid-2013, global nitrogen fertilizer prices have trended down as global grain supply increased and growth in grain demand slowed due to more challenging worldwide economic considerations. During 2015, there were announced transactions for further consolidation in the North American nitrogen fertilizer market, including our definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire all outstanding units of Rentech Nitrogen. Refer to Note 1 (\"Formation of the Partnership, Organization and Nature of Business\") of Part II. Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of the mergers.\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the longer-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. We view the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve will continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S.\nIn order to assess our operating performance, we calculate the product pricing at gate as an input to determine our operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. We believe product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because we sell products at our plant gate and terminal locations' gates (sold gate) and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site (sold delivered). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.\nWe and other competitors in the U.S. farm belt share a significant transportation cost advantage when compared to our out-of-region competitors in serving the U.S. farm belt agricultural market; therefore we are able to cost-effectively sell substantially all of our products in the higher margin agricultural market. Further, we believe that a significant portion of our competitors' revenues are derived from the lower margin industrial market. Our products leave the plant either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. We do not currently incur significant intermediate transfer, storage, barge freight or pipeline freight charges; however, we do incur costs to maintain and repair our railcar fleet. Selling products to customers within economic rail transportation limits of the nitrogen fertilizer plant and keeping transportation costs low are keys to maintaining profitability.\nAs a result of the UAN expansion project completed in 2013, we will continue to upgrade substantially all of our ammonia production into UAN for as long as it makes economic sense to do so. The value of nitrogen fertilizer products is also an important consideration in understanding our results. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we upgraded approximately 96% and 97%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that presently generates greater profit than ammonia.\nThe high fixed cost of our direct operating expense structure also directly affects our profitability. Our facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. Major fixed operating expenses include a large portion of electrical energy, employee labor, maintenance, including contract labor,\nand outside services. We estimate these fixed costs averaged approximately 80% of direct operating expenses over the 24 months ended December 31, 2015.\nOur largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which we purchase from CVR Refining and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred approximately $11.9 million, $13.6 million and $14.6 million, respectively, for pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of $25, $28 and $30, respectively.\nConsistent, safe, and reliable operations at our nitrogen fertilizer plant are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. Unplanned downtime of the plant may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a temporary increase in working capital investment and related inventory position. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is mitigated through a diligent planning process that takes into account margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance, feedstock logistics and other factors. Historically, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has undergone a full facility turnaround approximately every two to three years. Turnarounds are expected to last 14-21 days. A less involved facility shutdown was performed during the second quarter of 2014 and included both the installation of a waste heat boiler and the completion of several key tasks in order to upgrade the pressure swing adsorption unit. The Partnership underwent a full facility turnaround in the third quarter of 2015, and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each at a cost, exclusive of the impacts due to the lost production during the downtime, of approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Partnership is planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround in the second half of 2017.\nAgreements with CVR Energy and CVR Refining\nWe are party to several agreements with CVR Energy and its affiliates that govern the business relations among us, CVR Energy and its subsidiaries (including CVR Refining, and our general partner). These include the pet coke supply agreement under which we buy the pet coke we use in our nitrogen fertilizer plant; a services agreement, under which CVR Energy and its affiliates provide us with management services including the services of its senior management team; a feedstock and shared services agreement, which governs the provision of feedstocks, including, but not limited to, hydrogen, high-pressure steam, nitrogen, instrument air, oxygen and natural gas; a raw water and facilities sharing agreement, which allocates raw water resources between the two businesses; an easement agreement; an environmental agreement; and a lease agreement pursuant to which we lease office space and laboratory space. These agreements were not the result of arm's length negotiations and the terms of these agreements are not necessarily as favorable to the parties to these agreements as terms which could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See Note 14 (\"Related Party Transactions\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional discussion of the agreements.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below.\n2015 Turnaround\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the nitrogen fertilizer facility completed a major scheduled turnaround and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately $7.0 million associated with the 2015 turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLinde Air Separation Unit Related Downtime\nLinde owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to our facility. During the third quarter of 2015, the Linde air separation unit experienced downtime, in excess of the downtime associated with the major scheduled turnaround discussed above, that resulted in the gasification, ammonia and UAN units being down for between 16 to 19 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIndustry Factors\nGlobal demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by population growth, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association, from 1973 to 2013, global fertilizer demand grew 1.9% annually. Fertilizer use is projected to increase by 45% between 2005 and 2030 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. As an example, China's wheat and coarse grains production increased 51% between 2005 and 2015, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its imports by more than 200% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\").\nWorld grain demand increased 9% from 2012 to 2015, according to the USDA, leading to a tighter grain supply environment and significant increases in grain prices that is supportive of fertilizer prices.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices have decoupled from their historical correlation with natural gas prices and are now driven primarily by demand dynamics. At existing grain prices and prices implied by futures markets, farmers are expected to generate profits leading to relatively inelastic demand for fertilizers.\nThe United States is the world's largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 33% of world exports and 29% of world production during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year, according to the USDA. Fertecon estimates the United States is the world's third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and historically the world's first or second largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer, importing approximately 42% of its nitrogen fertilizer needs during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year. North American producers have a significant and sustainable cost advantage over the majority of producers that export to the U.S. market.\nThe three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the U.S. are ammonia, urea and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe period to period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our consolidated financial statements. In order to effectively review and assess our historical financial information below, we have also included supplemental operating measures and industry measures that we believe are material to understanding our business.\nTo supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results.\nThe following tables summarize the financial data and key operating statistics for CVR Partners and our subsidiaries for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report.\n\n (1) Amounts are shown exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Amounts excluded from selling, general and administrative expenses are nominal. Depreciation and amortization is primarily comprised of the following components: \n\n (2) Our direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses include amounts for share-based compensation, which include amounts related to CVR Energy's share-based compensation expense allocated to us by CVR Energy for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3 (\"Share-Based Compensation\") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of allocated share-based compensation expenses. The charges for allocated share-based compensation were: \n\n (3) Amounts are shown exclusive of major scheduled turnaround expenses that are separately disclosed. \n (4) On August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners. The Partnership incurred approximately $2.3 million of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, as discussed above in \"Pending Mergers\", which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. \n (5) EBITDA is defined as net income before (i) interest (income) expense, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. \nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of non-cash share-based compensation, and, when applicable, major scheduled turnaround expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets and expenses associated with the pending Rentech Nitrogen mergers.\nWe present EBITDA because we believe it allows users of our financial statements, such as investors and analysts, to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes expenses, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets and expenses associated with the pending Rentech Nitrogen mergers, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these expenses is discussed herein, so that investors have complete information about expenses. In addition, we believe that it is useful to exclude from Adjusted EBITDA non-cash share-based compensation, although it is a recurring cost incurred in the ordinary course of business. In our view, non-cash share-based compensation, which also is presented in our financial statements and discussed herein, reflects a non-cash cost which may obscure, for a given period, trends in the underlying business, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors\nand analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of our Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\n\n (6) The board of directors of our general partner has a policy to calculate available cash for distribution starting with Adjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, available cash for distribution equaled our Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate, and transaction expenses associated with the Rentech Nitrogen mergers, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIndustry Factors\nGlobal demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by population growth, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association, from 1973 to 2013, global fertilizer demand grew 1.9% annually. Fertilizer use is projected to increase by 45% between 2005 and 2030 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. As an example, China's wheat and coarse grains production increased 51% between 2005 and 2015, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its imports by more than 200% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\").\nWorld grain demand increased 9% from 2012 to 2015, according to the USDA, leading to a tighter grain supply environment and significant increases in grain prices that is supportive of fertilizer prices.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices have decoupled from their historical correlation with natural gas prices and are now driven primarily by demand dynamics. At existing grain prices and prices implied by futures markets, farmers are expected to generate profits leading to relatively inelastic demand for fertilizers.\nThe United States is the world's largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 33% of world exports and 29% of world production during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year, according to the USDA. Fertecon estimates the United States is the world's third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and historically the world's first or second largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer, importing approximately 42% of its nitrogen fertilizer needs during the 2014 - 2015 marketing year. North American producers have a significant and sustainable cost advantage over the majority of producers that export to the U.S. market.\nThe three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the U.S. are ammonia, urea and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe period to period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our consolidated financial statements. In order to effectively review and assess our historical financial information below, we have also included supplemental operating measures and industry measures that we believe are material to understanding our business.\nTo supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results.\nThe following tables summarize the financial data and key operating statistics for CVR Partners and our subsidiaries for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

The Partnership incurred approximately $2.3 million of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, as discussed above in \"Pending Mergers\", which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. \n (5) EBITDA is defined as net income before (i) interest (income) expense, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. \nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of non-cash share-based compensation, and, when applicable, major scheduled turnaround expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets and expenses associated with the pending Rentech Nitrogen mergers.\nWe present EBITDA because we believe it allows users of our financial statements, such as investors and analysts, to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes expenses, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets and expenses associated with the pending Rentech Nitrogen mergers, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these expenses is discussed herein, so that investors have complete information about expenses. In addition, we believe that it is useful to exclude from Adjusted EBITDA non-cash share-based compensation, although it is a recurring cost incurred in the ordinary course of business. In our view, non-cash share-based compensation, which also is presented in our financial statements and discussed herein, reflects a non-cash cost which may obscure, for a given period, trends in the underlying business, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors\nand analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of our Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other financing costs, net\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Major scheduled turnaround expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation, non-cash\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses associated with the Rentech Nitrogen mergers\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (6) The board of directors of our general partner has a policy to calculate available cash for distribution starting with Adjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, available cash for distribution equaled our Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate, and transaction expenses associated with the Rentech Nitrogen mergers, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of"}
