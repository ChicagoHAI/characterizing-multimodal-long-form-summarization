Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses through our subsidiaries and controlled entities in China. One of the businesses is in the field of compressed air energy storage in China and produces electricity generation systems that combine its compressed air storage technology with photovoltaic ( PV\u201d) panels to achieve a continuous supply of power under weather conditions that are unfavorable to the generation of electricity from PV panels alone. The sales and installation of power generation systems and PV systems and the sales of PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pump products have been carried out through the Company's variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), formerly Sanhe Luck Sky Electrical Engineering Co., Ltd. ( Sanhe Xiangtian\u201d) and currently Xianning Xiangtian Energy Holding Group Co. Ltd. ( Xianning Xiangtian\u201d), formerly known as Xianning Sanhe Power Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nIn March 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed Xiangtian Zhongdian (Hubei) New Energy Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Zhongdian\u201d), a joint venture in China, in which Xianning Xiangtian holds a 70% ownership interest with the remaining 30% ownership held by Nanjing Zhongdian Photovoltaic Co. Ltd. Xiangtian Zhongdian is in the business of manufacturing and sales of PV panels. In April 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Jingshan Sanhe Xiangtian New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. ( Jingshan Sanhe\u201d), which is engaged in the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products. In June 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd. ( Hubei Jinli\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components, and acquired Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd. ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of petroleum products (Note 3 - Business combinations). In August 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Xianning Xiangtian Trade Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Trade\u201d), which engaged in trading general merchandise.\nIn December 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Rongentang Wine Co., Ltd. ( Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of wine, and acquired Hubei Rongentang Herbal Wine Co., Ltd. ( Herbal Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of herbal wine products.\nThe table below illustrates the businesses we conduct through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>Subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Business </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sanhe Xiangtian </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales of PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pump products and sale and installation of power generation systems and PV systems </td> <td> </td> <td>Hebei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xiangtian Zhongdian </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacture and sales of PV panels </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jingshan Sanhe </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacturing and sales of Synthetic fuel products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hubei Jinli </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacture and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tianjin Jiabaili </td> <td> </td> <td>Synthetic fuel production </td> <td> </td> <td>Tianjin </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xianning Xiangtian </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacturing and sales of air compression equipment and heat pump products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xiangtian Trade </td> <td> </td> <td>Sale of synthetic fuel products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rongentang Wine </td> <td> </td> <td>Wine production </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rongentang Herbal Wine </td> <td> </td> <td>Herbal Wine production </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September and October 2018, January 2019 and March 2019, Mr. Jian Zhou, our Chairman and principal shareholder as well as a shareholder of Xianning Xiangtian, and Zhou Deng Rong, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and director, injected an aggregate of RMB 209,260,000 (approximately $30.8 million) as capital contribution to Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn November 5, 2018, we changed our name to XT Energy Group, Inc. through a merger with and into our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of affecting the name change.\nOn May 24, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d), discussed a plan to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership interest in Herbal Wine Co. and Wine Co. in order to shift its business focus on its energy related business. Therefore the result of operations was presented as discontinued operations as of and for the year ended July 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements.\nReorganization\nOn September 30, 2018, Xiangtian Shenzhen terminated its variable interest entity agreements (the VIE Agreements\u201d) as part of its restructuring to facilitate the shift of business focus between entities controlled by the Company. After the restructuring, the Company's headquarter is located in the city of Xianning, Hubei Province, and Sanhe Xiangtian, the Company's previous headquarter, located in the city of Sanhe, Hebei Province, is restructured as our sales office. The VIE Agreements include the following:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Framework Agreement on Business Cooperation, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Exclusive Management, Consulting and Training and Technical Service Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Exclusive Option Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and all the shareholders of Sanhe Xiangtian ( Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders\u201d); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Equity Pledge Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and the Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Know-How Sub-License Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Powers of Attorney of the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders dated July 25, 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the termination of the VIE Agreements, on September 30, 2018, Sanhe Xiangtian transferred its 100% equity interest of Xianning Xiangtian to the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders and the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders transferred their 100% equity interest of Sanhe Xiangtian to Xianning Xiangtian. As a result of the foregoing equity transfers, Sanhe Xiangtian became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn the same day, the Company, through Xiangtian Shenzhen and Xiangtian HK, entered into a new series of variable interest entity agreements ( New VIE Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which Xianning Xiangtian became the Company's new contractually controlled affiliate. The New VIE Agreements allow us to:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>exercise effective control over Xianning Xiangtian; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Xianning Xiangtian; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Xianning Xiangtian when and to the extent permitted by the laws of the PRC. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the New VIE Agreements, we have become the primary beneficiary of Xianning Xiangtian, and it treats Xianning Xiangtian as its variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP. We will continue to consolidate the financial results of Xianning Xiangtian in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above reorganization has no effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the current period and thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statement of the Company for the years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and related notes thereto.\nThe Year Ended July 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2018\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue was derived from the installation of power generation systems, the sales of PV panels and others, air compression equipment and other components, heat pump products, high-grade synthetic fuel products, and hydraulic parts and electronic components for the year ended July 31, 2019.\nTotal revenues increased by $37,857,125 or 247.9%, to $53,126,913 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $15,269,788 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The overall increase was primarily attributable to the increase of revenue generated from sales of PV panels and other products, heat pumps, high-grade synthetic fuel and hydraulic parts and electronic components.\nOur revenue from our revenue categories is summarized as follows:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year ended\nJuly 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year ended\nJuly 31,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change (%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installation of power generation systems </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>391,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,456,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,064,626 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PV panels and others </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,321,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,583,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,738,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Air compression equipment and other components </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,373,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Heat pumps </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,771,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,237,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>471.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>High-grade synthetic fuel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,957,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,351,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,606,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hydraulic parts and electronic components </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,310,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,067,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,500.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,126,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,269,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,857,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInstallation of power generation systems revenue decreased by $5,064,626 or 92.8% from $5,456,463 for the year ended July 31, 2018 to $391,837 for the year ended July 31, 2019 because we did not have any new installation projects performed during the year ended July 31, 2019. We will keep searching for large installation projects to increase our revenue. Sales of PV panels and others increased by $17,738,131 or 317.7% from $5,583,858 for the year ended July 31, 2018 to $23,321,989 for the same period in 2019. The increase in sales of PV panels and others was mainly attributable to the Company commencing sales of PV panels in March 2018 and therefore we had a full year of sales for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to four months sales during the year ended July 31, 2018. Sales of air compression equipment and other components increased by $271,452 or 24.6% and the sales of heat pumps increased by $7,237,607 or 471.9% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018. Air compression equipment and other components and heat pumps are parts of the installation of power generation systems, which were not sold separately during the year ended July 31, 2018 while we sold them as separate components as a result of our marketing efforts during the year ended July 31, 2019, which resulted in the increase of sales revenues.\nSales of high-grade synthetic fuel increased by $11,606,729 or 859.0% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018 was mainly due to our entering into the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products in April 2018. We expect our sales of high-grade synthetic fuel to continue to increase significantly as we expand our product offering to include synthetic fuel for diesel vehicles, which has already passed the testing production.\nSales of hydraulic parts and electronic components increased by $6,067,832 or 2,500.5% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018 due to our acquisition of Hubei Jinli in June 2018 which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue increased by $27,585,326, or 218.4%, to $40,216,790 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $12,631,464 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was due to the increase of revenue.\nOur cost of revenue from our revenue categories is summarized as follows:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increase in revenues contributed by PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, our overall gross profit percentage was 24.3% and 17.3%, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in sales of our air compression equipment and other components, high-grade synthetic fuel products and hydraulic parts and electronic components, which generally have a higher gross profit percentage.\nGross profit percentage for our installation of power generation systems revenue was 8.2% and 13.5% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage is mainly due to our final installation project for the year ended July 31, 2019 has a lower gross profit percentage as the project is smaller in size with a lesser profit margin.\nGross profit percentage for PV panels and others revenue was 9.5% and 13.0% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for air compression equipment and other components revenue was 18.5% and 17.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for heat pumps revenue was 16.7% and 28.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for high-grade synthetic fuel revenue was 38.5% and 38.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue was 62.6% and 15.8% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to we obtaining a few large specialty governmental contracts with higher selling price during the year ended July 31, 2019, which increased our gross profit percentage to 62.6%. Historically, our gross profit has been around 45% to 60% depends on the market price of steel, our major raw materials cost. On the other hand, we acquired Hubei Jinli for the hydraulic parts and electronic components operations at the end of June 2018. We wrote off approximately $58,000 of raw materials in July 2018 and our gross profit for July 2018 of Hubei Jinli became lower than our average gross profit. As a result, our gross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue increased from 15.8% in the year ended July 31, 2018 to 62.6% in the year ended July 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $8,085,164 or 231.8% from $3,487,755 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $11,572,919 during the same period in 2019. The increase in operating expenses was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in selling expenses of $1,370,010, (ii) the increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,306,210, (iii) the increase in research and development expenses of $319,539, (iv) the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $541,687 as we have more aged receivables, (v) the increase in impairment loss of intangible assets and goodwill of $983,603 as we determined that Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd.'s ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d) operation would not be able to begin production due to misrepresentation of the production facility of Tianjin Jiabaili from the former shareholders of Tianjin Jiabiali, (vi) the increase in impairment loss of deposit for investment of $320,457 as we were not able to collect the investment deposit after exhaustive efforts at collection were made, and (vii) the increase in change in estimated contingent liabilities of $243,658 as Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd.'s ( Jinli\u201d) operation result were better than our previous estimates at July 31, 2018 for profit sharing clause payable to the former shareholder of Jinli for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018.\nThe increase in selling expenses of approximately $1,370,000 was mainly attributable to the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses and benefits of approximately $212,000, and the increase in commission of approximately $495,000 due to the increased number of sales representatives and the increase in shipping expense of approximately $652,000 as a result of the increase in products sold. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $4,306,000 was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses, and benefits expenses of approximately $1,056,000, (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $388,000, (iii) the increase in rent and property management expenses of approximately $524,000, (iv) the increase in utility expenses of approximately $221,000, (v) the increase in travel expenses of approximately $86,000, (vi) the increase of meal and entertainment expenses of approximately $128,000 and (vii) the increase in professional fees including legal fees, audit fees and consulting fees of approximately $1,397,000. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018. This increase is offset by (i) approximately $101,000 decrease in services expenses and (ii) approximately $74,000 decrease in inspection expenses.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, we have incurred R&D expense of $323,216 and $3,677, respectively. The increase of R&D expenses are mainly due to our research and development costs incurred on improving our hydraulic parts and electronic components products as well as researching and developing new high-grade synthetic fuel products.\nOther (Expenses) Income, Net\nTotal other expenses increased by $893,255 or 331.0% from $269,844 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $1,163,099 during the year ended July 31, 2019. The increase in total other expenses was mainly attributable to the increase in interest expense as a result of the third party loans that we obtained in 2018 to pay for the initial payments in relation to the acquisition of Hubei Jinli and Tianjin Jiabaili in June 2018. In addition, Hubei Jinli had existing bank loans prior to our acquisition. We also obtained a new related party loan in January 2019 for the payments in relation to the acquisition of Wine Co. and Herbal Wine Co. As a result, we incurred approximately $462,000 interest expense for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, the acquisition of Hubei Jinli also includes three installment payments each due on June 20 of 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, which resulted in amortization of debt discount of our investment payable of approximately $493,000 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, we made the payment for acquisition of Hubei Jinli prior to the original due date, as a result, we recognized a one-time finance expenses of approximately $490,000 at the time for which the discount portion of the payment for the original due date were prepaid for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur current income tax expense was $1,964,238 and $180,147 for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our income tax expense was incurred by our profitable VIEs and controlled entities in both periods and we have provided 100% allowance on net operating losses for our VIEs and controlled entities which incurred losses. Our effective tax rate for the year ended July 31, 2019 was 1,128.2% mainly due to we had significant income taxes expenses incurred in our profitable VIEs and controlled entities, which is significant higher than our consolidated income before income taxes, and resulted in significant effective tax rate during the period.\nLoss from continuing operations\nOur net loss from continuing operations increased by $490,711, or 37.8%, to net loss of $1,790,133 for the year ended July 31, 2019, from a net loss of $1,299,422 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes discussed above.\nDiscontinued operations\nNet income from discontinued operations\nOur net income from discontinued operations increased by $1,051,152, or 100.0%, to net income of $1,051,152 for the year ended July 31, 2019, from a net income of $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The increase in income from discontinued operations was predominantly due to the revenue generated by Herbal Wine Co. and Wine Co. which considered as discontinued operations since the board discussed a plan to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership interest in Herbal Wine Co. and Wine Co. in order to shift its business focus on its energy related business. See Note 4 - Discontinued operations. We did not have such operations during the year ended July 31, 2018.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss decreased by $560,441, or 43.1%, to net loss of $738,981 for the year ended July 31, 2019, from a net loss of $1,299,422 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes discussed above.\nThe Year Ended July 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2017\nRevenue\nOur revenue consisted of installation of power generation systems and the sales of PV Panels, air compression equipment, heat pump products, high-grade synthetic fuel products, hydraulic parts and electronic components for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues increased by $5,748,417, or 60.4%, to $15,269,788 for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to $9,521,371 for the year ended July 31, 2017. The overall increase was primarily attributable to the increase of our sales of PV panels, air compression equipment, heat pumps, high-grade synthetic fuel, and hydraulic parts and electronic components offset by the decrease in revenue of the installation of power generation systems.\nOur revenue from our revenue categories is summarized as follows:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year ended\nJuly 31,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year ended\nJuly 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change (%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installation of power generation systems </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,456,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,299,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,843,480 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PV panels and others </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,583,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,362,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Air compression equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Heat pumps </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>High-grade synthetic bio-fuel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,351,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,351,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hydraulic parts and electronic components </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,269,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,521,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,748,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInstallation of power generation systems revenue decreased by $1,843,480 or 25.3% from $7,299,943 for the year ended July 31, 2017 to $5,456,463 for the year ended July 31, 2018 as our customers started using their own installation team while only purchasing the PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pumps from us during the year ended July 31, 2018. The change is consistent with the increase in sales of PV panels by $3,362,430 or 151.4%, increase in sales of air compression equipment by $1,101,744 or 100% and the increase in sales of heat pumps by $1,533,845 or 100% for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017. These three types of products are parts of the installation of power generation systems, which were not sold separately during the year ended July 31, 2017 while we sold them as separate components during the year ended July 31, 2018, which resulted in the increase of sales revenues. We expect our air compression systems and products sales will go down in the future as the demand for them is lower as compared to our PV products since the cost of PV electricity is generally cheaper. The increase in sales of PV panels is also attributable to the establishment of Xiangtian Zhongdian in March 2018, which is in the business of manufacturing and sales of PV panels, and contributed $3,682,011 of revenues for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nDuring the quarter ended July 31, 2018, the Company recognized sales and installation of power generation systems of approximately $2.1 million with gross profit of approximately $343,000 and sales of PV panels of approximately $1.5 million with gross profit of approximately $245,000. The completion of installation and delivery of products occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2017. These revenues were contributed from the same customer and being deferred and recognized during the quarter ended July 31, 2018 mainly because the collectability were assured after additional inspections of the Company's projects and products with payment approval in September 2018 before the issuance of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year 2018. The Company also performed an impairment test on the deferred cost as of July 31, 2017 and determined no allowance on deferred cost were deemed necessary as our products can easily be dismantled and resold above its deferred cost if the Company were unable to pass the second inspections.\nSales of high-grade synthetic fuel increased by $1,351,215 or 100% for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017 due to our establishment of Jingshan Sanhe in April 2018 which is engaged in the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products. We expect our sales of high-grade synthetic fuel will continue to increase significantly as we expand our product offering to include a new product, Xiangtian No. 5, gas or diesel engine cleaner we developed to clean and lubricate fuel system and stops corrosion, and protect engines of vehicles. We began marketing and selling Xiangtian No. 5 in September 2019.\nSales of hydraulic parts and electronic components increased by $242,663 or 100% for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017 due to our acquisition of Hubei Jinli in June 2018 which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue increased by $4,088,257, or 47.9%, to $12,631,464 for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to $8,543,207 for the year ended July 31, 2017.

increased by $1,660,160, or 169.7%, to $2,638,324 during the year ended July 31, 2018, from $978,164 for the year ended July 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increase of revenues contributed by Xiangtian Zhongdian, established in March 2018, Jingshan Sanhe, established in April 2018, and Hubei Jinli, acquired in June 2018.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, our overall gross profit percentage was 17.3% and 10.3%, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase of revenue for our high-grade synthetic fuel products, which were new products sold by our Company from 2018 and generally have a higher gross profit percentage.\nGross profit percentage for our installation of power generation systems revenue was consistent at 13.5% and 13.3% for the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to the fact there we were trying to stay competitive in our operations of bidding our installation projects while ensuring that we maintain our profitability within similar profit range.\nGross profit percentage for PV panels and others revenue was 13.0% and 0.5% for the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of gross profit percentage was mainly due to recognizing an inventory obsolescence loss of $337,000 for the year ended July 31, 2017 that drove down our gross profit percentage to 0.5% for the year ended July 31, 2017 while we did not have such inventory obsolescence losses for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses decreased by $1,905,878 or 35.3% from $5,393,633 during the year ended July 31, 2017 to $3,487,755 during the year ended July 31, 2018. The decrease in operating expenses were mainly attributable to the decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of $1,395,152, the increase of recovery for doubtful accounts of $119,003, and the decrease of impairment of advance to suppliers of $1,404,565 offset by the increase of selling expenses of $268,212 and the increase of general and administrative expenses of $740,953 for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017.\nThe increase of selling expenses of approximately $268,000 is mainly attributable to the increase of sales agent and commission fees of approximately $125,000, the increase of commissions to our sales staff of approximately $62,000, the increase of travel expenses of approximately $33,000, the increase of shipping expenses of approximately $25,000, and the increase of other miscellaneous selling expenses, such as meals and entertainment, deprecation, and advertising of approximately $23,000. The above increases are mainly attributable to the increased operations from Xiangtian Zhongdian, established in March 2018, Jingshan Sanhe, established in April 2018, and Hubei Jinli, acquired in June 2018.\nThe increase of general and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses of approximately $741,000 is mainly attributable to the increase of rental expenses of approximately $146,000, the increase of depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $144,000, the increase of salary and social insurance expenses of approximately $134,000, the increase of professional fees such as legal, audit and consulting of approximately $99,000, the increase of product inspection expense of approximately $140,000, the increase of late filing U.S. tax return penalty of approximately $80,000, and the increase of other miscellaneous G&A expenses $1,000. The above increases are mainly attributable to the increased operations from Xiangtian Zhongdian, established in March 2018, Jingshan Sanhe, established in April 2018, Hubei Jinli, acquired in June 2018 and Tianjin Jiabaili acquired in June 2018.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nFor the year ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, we have incurred R&D expense of $3,677 and $0, respectively. We have not incurred any significant expenses for research and development from inception through July 31, 2018. Company employees only conduct basic research and do not work on a specific plan or project to which expenses can be allocated.\nOther income (expenses), net\nTotal other income (expenses) decreased by $279,395 from $9,551 of other income during the year ended July 31, 2017 to $269,844 of other expenses during the year ended July 31, 2018. The decrease in total income (expenses) mainly attributable to related parties loan and third parties loan that we obtained in 2018 to pay for the initial acquisition payments in relation to the acquisition of Hubei Jinli and Tianjin Jiabaili in June 2018. In addition, Hubei Jinli has existing bank loans prior to our acquisition. As a result, we have incurred approximately $256,000 interest expenses for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2017. Furthermore, the acquisition of Hubei Jinli also includes three installment payments to be due on each of the June 20 of 2019, 2020 and 2021, which resulted in amortization of debt discount of our investment payable of approximately $43,000 for the year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nOur income tax expense was $180,147 and $158,241 for the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although we had net loss before income taxes, our income tax expense was incurred by our profitable variable interest entity and its subsidiaries in both periods and we have provided 100% allowance on net operating losses for our variable interest entity and its subsidiaries for which it has incurred losses.\nNet loss\nOur net loss decreased by $3,264,737, or 71.5%, to $1,299,422 for the year ended July 31, 2018, from $4,564,159 for the year ended July 31, 2017. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nIn assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Debt financing in the form of loans including related party loans have been utilized to finance our working capital requirements. As of July 31, 2019, the Company's working deficit was approximately $1.9 million and the Company had cash and restricted cash of approximately $3.5 million.\nGiven our expected expenditures in the foreseeable future together with our cash flow from the financing activities, we have comprehensively considered our available sources of funds as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we will continuously seek equity financing (including a proposed underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 on February 1, 2019) to support its working capital; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other available sources of financing from PRC banks and other financial institutions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>financial support and credit guarantee commitments from the Company's related parties. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on the above considerations, our management is of the opinion that we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and current liabilities as they become due for at least one year from the date of this report. However, there is no assurance that management will be successful in our plans. There are a number of factors that could potentially arise that could undermine our plans, such as changes in the demand for our products or installations, PRC government policy, economic conditions, and competitive pricing in the industries that we operates in.\nOur management has considered whether there is a going concern issue due to our recurring losses from operations. Based upon the continuing financial support and credit guarantee commitments from our related parties to provide the necessary funds to us to continue our operations should the need arise, our management believes that we have alleviated the going concern issue.\nWe also expect to raise additional capital through public offerings with the proceeds to be used for 1) leasing additional production facilities for synthetic fuel and related products, 2) adding a new packaging line for our synthetic fuel and related products in Jingshan Sanhe, and 3) general corporate purpose.\nThe following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended July 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,824,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(389,902 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>944,246 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,474,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,710,870 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,178,565 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,813,140 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,737,061 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,075,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,316,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>947,729 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(442,946 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate change on cash and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(263,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(658,972 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(148,086 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net change in cash and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,779,403 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,088,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,251 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of July 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a cash and restricted cash balance of $3,536,481 and $14,245,783, respectively, from continuing operations.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was approximately $3.8 million for the year ended July 31, 2019.

We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management's difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements include the estimated cost used to calculate the percentage of completion recognized in our revenues, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for accounts receivable doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence reserve, allowance for advance to suppliers doubtful accounts, allowance for deferred tax assets, fair value of the assets and the liabilities of the entity acquired through our business combination, valuation of warranty reserves, contingent consideration liabilities, and the accrual of potential liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nContract Assets\nThe differences between the timing of the Company's revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on unconditional rights to receive the consideration in the contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. Provisions for estimated losses of contract assets on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined.\nDiscontinued operations\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as discontinued operations. When all of the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations are met, including management having the authority to approve the action and committing to a plan to sell the entity, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from the balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of operations discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45. See Note 4 - Discontinued operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn August 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of July 31, 2018. This did not result in an adjustment to the retained earnings upon adoption of this new guidance as our revenue was recognized based on the amount of consideration expected to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations.\nThe core principle underlying the revenue recognition ASU is that we will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in such exchange. This will require us to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. Our revenue streams are recognized over time for our sale and installation of power generation systems and are recognized at a point in time for our sale of products.\nThe ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires us to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way we record our revenue. Upon adoption, we evaluated our revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition.\nSale and installation of power generation systems\nSales of power generation system in conjunction of system installation are generally recognized based on our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation using an input measure method, which essentially the same as the percentage of completion method prior to August 1, 2018 for its installation project. Therefore, take into account the costs, estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed. Revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that costs expended to date bear to anticipated final total costs, based on current estimates of costs to complete. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and supplies. Adjustments to the original estimates of the total contract revenue, total contract costs, or the extent of progress toward completion are often required as work progresses. Such changes and refinements in estimation are reflected in reported results of operations as they occur; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to the unit material cost, the quantity of materials to be used, the installation cost and those indirect costs related to contract performance. The estimate of unit material cost is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis, based on the updated information available in the supply markets. The estimate of material quantity to be used for completion and the installation cost is also reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis, based on the updated information on the progress of project execution. If the supply market conditions or the progress of project execution were different, it is likely that materially different amounts of contract costs would be used in the percentage of completion method of accounting. Thus the uncertainty associated with those estimates may impact our consolidated financial statements. Selling, general, and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time a loss on a contract becomes known, the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Claims for additional contract costs are recognized upon a signed change order from the customer.\nThe installation revenues and sales of equipment and system component are combined and considered as one performance obligation. The promises to transfer the equipment and system component and installation are not separately identifiable, which is evidencing by the fact that we provide a significant services of integrating the goods and services into a power generation system for which the customer has contracted. We currently do not have any modification of contract and the contract currently does not have any variable consideration.\nSales of products\nWe continue to derive our revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized upon delivery of products. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales contract and invoice; and the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the sales contract and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or other incentive. Such revenues are recognized at a point in time after all performance obligations are satisfied and based on when control of goods transfer to a customer, which is generally similar to when its delivery has occurred prior to August 1, 2018.\nGross versus Net Revenue Reporting\nIn the normal course of the Company's trading business, the Company orders products directly from its suppliers and drop ships the products directly to its customers. In these situations, the Company generally collects the sales proceeds directly from its customers and pays for the inventory purchases to its suppliers separately. The determination of whether revenues should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on the Company's assessment of whether it is the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent, the Company follows the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. Because the Company is not the primary obligor and is not responsible for (i) fulfilling the resale products delivery, (ii) establishing the selling prices for delivery of the resale products, (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk and (iv) baring the back-end risk of inventory loss with respect to any product return from its customer, the Company has concluded that it is the agent in these arrangements, and therefore report revenues and cost of revenues on a net basis.\nWarranty\nWe generally provide limited warranties for work performed under our contracts. At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs under ASC 460. Such estimated costs for warranties are estimated at completion and these warrants are not service warranties separately sold by us. Generally, the estimated claim rates of warranty are based on actual warranty experience or our best estimate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.", "summary": "This report provides an overview of the activities and financial results of an energy company with various subsidiaries in China.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses through our subsidiaries and controlled entities in China. One of the businesses is in the field of compressed air energy storage in China and produces electricity generation systems that combine its compressed air storage technology with photovoltaic ( PV\u201d) panels to achieve a continuous supply of power under weather conditions that are unfavorable to the generation of electricity from PV panels alone. The sales and installation of power generation systems and PV systems and the sales of PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pump products have been carried out through the Company's variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), formerly Sanhe Luck Sky Electrical Engineering Co., Ltd. ( Sanhe Xiangtian\u201d) and currently Xianning Xiangtian Energy Holding Group Co. Ltd. ( Xianning Xiangtian\u201d), formerly known as Xianning Sanhe Power Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nIn March 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed Xiangtian Zhongdian (Hubei) New Energy Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Zhongdian\u201d), a joint venture in China, in which Xianning Xiangtian holds a 70% ownership interest with the remaining 30% ownership held by Nanjing Zhongdian Photovoltaic Co. Ltd. Xiangtian Zhongdian is in the business of manufacturing and sales of PV panels. In April 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Jingshan Sanhe Xiangtian New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. ( Jingshan Sanhe\u201d), which is engaged in the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products. In June 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd. ( Hubei Jinli\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components, and acquired Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd. ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of petroleum products (Note 3 - Business combinations). In August 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Xianning Xiangtian Trade Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Trade\u201d), which engaged in trading general merchandise.\nIn December 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Rongentang Wine Co., Ltd. ( Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of wine, and acquired Hubei Rongentang Herbal Wine Co., Ltd. ( Herbal Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of herbal wine products.\nThe table below illustrates the businesses we conduct through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities:\n\nIn September and October 2018, January 2019 and March 2019, Mr. Jian Zhou, our Chairman and principal shareholder as well as a shareholder of Xianning Xiangtian, and Zhou Deng Rong, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and director, injected an aggregate of RMB 209,260,000 (approximately $30.8 million) as capital contribution to Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn November 5, 2018, we changed our name to XT Energy Group, Inc. through a merger with and into our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of affecting the name change.\nOn May 24, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d), discussed a plan to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership interest in Herbal Wine Co. and Wine Co. in order to shift its business focus on its energy related business. Therefore the result of operations was presented as discontinued operations as of and for the year ended July 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements.\nReorganization\nOn September 30, 2018, Xiangtian Shenzhen terminated its variable interest entity agreements (the VIE Agreements\u201d) as part of its restructuring to facilitate the shift of business focus between entities controlled by the Company. After the restructuring, the Company's headquarter is located in the city of Xianning, Hubei Province, and Sanhe Xiangtian, the Company's previous headquarter, located in the city of Sanhe, Hebei Province, is restructured as our sales office. The VIE Agreements include the following:\n \u25cf Framework Agreement on Business Cooperation, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; \n \u25cf Exclusive Management, Consulting and Training and Technical Service Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; \n \u25cf Exclusive Option Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and all the shareholders of Sanhe Xiangtian ( Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders\u201d); \n \u25cf Equity Pledge Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and the Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders; \n \u25cf Know-How Sub-License Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; and \n \u25cf Powers of Attorney of the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders dated July 25, 2014. \nIn connection with the termination of the VIE Agreements, on September 30, 2018, Sanhe Xiangtian transferred its 100% equity interest of Xianning Xiangtian to the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders and the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders transferred their 100% equity interest of Sanhe Xiangtian to Xianning Xiangtian. As a result of the foregoing equity transfers, Sanhe Xiangtian became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn the same day, the Company, through Xiangtian Shenzhen and Xiangtian HK, entered into a new series of variable interest entity agreements ( New VIE Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which Xianning Xiangtian became the Company's new contractually controlled affiliate. The New VIE Agreements allow us to:\n \u25cf exercise effective control over Xianning Xiangtian; \n \u25cf receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Xianning Xiangtian; and \n \u25cf have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Xianning Xiangtian when and to the extent permitted by the laws of the PRC. \nAs a result of the New VIE Agreements, we have become the primary beneficiary of Xianning Xiangtian, and it treats Xianning Xiangtian as its variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP. We will continue to consolidate the financial results of Xianning Xiangtian in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above reorganization has no effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the current period and thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statement of the Company for the years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and related notes thereto.\nThe Year Ended July 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2018\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue was derived from the installation of power generation systems, the sales of PV panels and others, air compression equipment and other components, heat pump products, high-grade synthetic fuel products, and hydraulic parts and electronic components for the year ended July 31, 2019.\nTotal revenues increased by $37,857,125 or 247.9%, to $53,126,913 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $15,269,788 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The overall increase was primarily attributable to the increase of revenue generated from sales of PV panels and other products, heat pumps, high-grade synthetic fuel and hydraulic parts and electronic components.\nOur revenue from our revenue categories is summarized as follows:\n\nInstallation of power generation systems revenue decreased by $5,064,626 or 92.8% from $5,456,463 for the year ended July 31, 2018 to $391,837 for the year ended July 31, 2019 because we did not have any new installation projects performed during the year ended July 31, 2019. We will keep searching for large installation projects to increase our revenue. Sales of PV panels and others increased by $17,738,131 or 317.7% from $5,583,858 for the year ended July 31, 2018 to $23,321,989 for the same period in 2019. The increase in sales of PV panels and others was mainly attributable to the Company commencing sales of PV panels in March 2018 and therefore we had a full year of sales for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to four months sales during the year ended July 31, 2018. Sales of air compression equipment and other components increased by $271,452 or 24.6% and the sales of heat pumps increased by $7,237,607 or 471.9% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018. Air compression equipment and other components and heat pumps are parts of the installation of power generation systems, which were not sold separately during the year ended July 31, 2018 while we sold them as separate components as a result of our marketing efforts during the year ended July 31, 2019, which resulted in the increase of sales revenues.\nSales of high-grade synthetic fuel increased by $11,606,729 or 859.0% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018 was mainly due to our entering into the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products in April 2018. We expect our sales of high-grade synthetic fuel to continue to increase significantly as we expand our product offering to include synthetic fuel for diesel vehicles, which has already passed the testing production.\nSales of hydraulic parts and electronic components increased by $6,067,832 or 2,500.5% for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018 due to our acquisition of Hubei Jinli in June 2018 which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue increased by $27,585,326, or 218.4%, to $40,216,790 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $12,631,464 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was due to the increase of revenue.\nOur cost of revenue from our revenue categories is summarized as follows:\n\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit from our major revenue categories is summarized as follows:\n\nOur gross profit increased by $10,271,799, or 389.3%, to $12,910,123 during the year ended July 31, 2019 from $2,638,324 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increase in revenues contributed by PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, our overall gross profit percentage was 24.3% and 17.3%, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in sales of our air compression equipment and other components, high-grade synthetic fuel products and hydraulic parts and electronic components, which generally have a higher gross profit percentage.\nGross profit percentage for our installation of power generation systems revenue was 8.2% and 13.5% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage is mainly due to our final installation project for the year ended July 31, 2019 has a lower gross profit percentage as the project is smaller in size with a lesser profit margin.\nGross profit percentage for PV panels and others revenue was 9.5% and 13.0% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for air compression equipment and other components revenue was 18.5% and 17.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for heat pumps revenue was 16.7% and 28.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for high-grade synthetic fuel revenue was 38.5% and 38.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue was 62.6% and 15.8% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to we obtaining a few large specialty governmental contracts with higher selling price during the year ended July 31, 2019, which increased our gross profit percentage to 62.6%. Historically, our gross profit has been around 45% to 60% depends on the market price of steel, our major raw materials cost. On the other hand, we acquired Hubei Jinli for the hydraulic parts and electronic components operations at the end of June 2018. We wrote off approximately $58,000 of raw materials in July 2018 and our gross profit for July 2018 of Hubei Jinli became lower than our average gross profit. As a result, our gross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue increased from 15.8% in the year ended July 31, 2018 to 62.6% in the year ended July 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $8,085,164 or 231.8% from $3,487,755 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $11,572,919 during the same period in 2019. The increase in operating expenses was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in selling expenses of $1,370,010, (ii) the increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,306,210, (iii) the increase in research and development expenses of $319,539, (iv) the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $541,687 as we have more aged receivables, (v) the increase in impairment loss of intangible assets and goodwill of $983,603 as we determined that Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd.'s ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d) operation would not be able to begin production due to misrepresentation of the production facility of Tianjin Jiabaili from the former shareholders of Tianjin Jiabiali, (vi) the increase in impairment loss of deposit for investment of $320,457 as we were not able to collect the investment deposit after exhaustive efforts at collection were made, and (vii) the increase in change in estimated contingent liabilities of $243,658 as Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd.'s ( Jinli\u201d) operation result were better than our previous estimates at July 31, 2018 for profit sharing clause payable to the former shareholder of Jinli for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018.\nThe increase in selling expenses of approximately $1,370,000 was mainly attributable to the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses and benefits of approximately $212,000, and the increase in commission of approximately $495,000 due to the increased number of sales representatives and the increase in shipping expense of approximately $652,000 as a result of the increase in products sold. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $4,306,000 was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses, and benefits expenses of approximately $1,056,000, (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $388,000, (iii) the increase in rent and property management expenses of approximately $524,000, (iv) the increase in utility expenses of approximately $221,000, (v) the increase in travel expenses of approximately $86,000, (vi) the increase of meal and entertainment expenses of approximately $128,000 and (vii) the increase in professional fees including legal fees, audit fees and consulting fees of approximately $1,397,000. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018. This increase is offset by (i) approximately $101,000 decrease in services expenses and (ii) approximately $74,000 decrease in inspection expenses.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, we have incurred R&D expense of $323,216 and $3,677, respectively. The increase of R&D expenses are mainly due to our research and development costs incurred on improving our hydraulic parts and electronic components products as well as researching and developing new high-grade synthetic fuel products.\nOther (Expenses) Income, Net\nTotal other expenses increased by $893,255 or 331.0% from $269,844 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $1,163,099 during the year ended July 31, 2019. The increase in total other expenses was mainly attributable to the increase in interest expense as a result of the third party loans that we obtained in 2018 to pay for the initial payments in relation to the acquisition of Hubei Jinli and Tianjin Jiabaili in June 2018. In addition, Hubei Jinli had existing bank loans prior to our acquisition. We also obtained a new related party loan in January 2019 for the payments in relation to the acquisition of Wine Co. and Herbal Wine Co. As a result, we incurred approximately $462,000 interest expense for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, the acquisition of Hubei Jinli also includes three installment payments each due on June 20 of 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, which resulted in amortization of debt discount of our investment payable of approximately $493,000 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, we made the payment for acquisition of Hubei Jinli prior to the original due date, as a result, we recognized a one-time finance expenses of approximately $490,000 at the time for which the discount portion of the payment for the original due date were prepaid for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur current income tax expense was $1,964,238 and $180,147 for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our income tax expense was incurred by our profitable VIEs and controlled", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses through our subsidiaries and controlled entities in China. One of the businesses is in the field of compressed air energy storage in China and produces electricity generation systems that combine its compressed air storage technology with photovoltaic ( PV\u201d) panels to achieve a continuous supply of power under weather conditions that are unfavorable to the generation of electricity from PV panels alone. The sales and installation of power generation systems and PV systems and the sales of PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pump products have been carried out through the Company's variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), formerly Sanhe Luck Sky Electrical Engineering Co., Ltd. ( Sanhe Xiangtian\u201d) and currently Xianning Xiangtian Energy Holding Group Co. Ltd. ( Xianning Xiangtian\u201d), formerly known as Xianning Sanhe Power Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nIn March 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed Xiangtian Zhongdian (Hubei) New Energy Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Zhongdian\u201d), a joint venture in China, in which Xianning Xiangtian holds a 70% ownership interest with the remaining 30% ownership held by Nanjing Zhongdian Photovoltaic Co. Ltd. Xiangtian Zhongdian is in the business of manufacturing and sales of PV panels. In April 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Jingshan Sanhe Xiangtian New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. ( Jingshan Sanhe\u201d), which is engaged in the business of researching, manufacturing and sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products. In June 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd. ( Hubei Jinli\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components, and acquired Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd. ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of petroleum products (Note 3 - Business combinations). In August 2018, Xianning Xiangtian formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Xianning Xiangtian Trade Co. Ltd. ( Xiangtian Trade\u201d), which engaged in trading general merchandise.\nIn December 2018, Xianning Xiangtian acquired Hubei Rongentang Wine Co., Ltd. ( Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of wine, and acquired Hubei Rongentang Herbal Wine Co., Ltd. ( Herbal Wine Co.\u201d), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of herbal wine products.\nThe table below illustrates the businesses we conduct through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>Subsidiary </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Business </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sanhe Xiangtian </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales of PV panels, air compression equipment and heat pump products and sale and installation of power generation systems and PV systems </td> <td> </td> <td>Hebei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xiangtian Zhongdian </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacture and sales of PV panels </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jingshan Sanhe </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacturing and sales of Synthetic fuel products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hubei Jinli </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacture and sales of hydraulic parts and electronic components </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tianjin Jiabaili </td> <td> </td> <td>Synthetic fuel production </td> <td> </td> <td>Tianjin </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xianning Xiangtian </td> <td> </td> <td>Manufacturing and sales of air compression equipment and heat pump products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xiangtian Trade </td> <td> </td> <td>Sale of synthetic fuel products </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rongentang Wine </td> <td> </td> <td>Wine production </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rongentang Herbal Wine </td> <td> </td> <td>Herbal Wine production </td> <td> </td> <td>Hubei Province </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September and October 2018, January 2019 and March 2019, Mr. Jian Zhou, our Chairman and principal shareholder as well as a shareholder of Xianning Xiangtian, and Zhou Deng Rong, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and director, injected an aggregate of RMB 209,260,000 (approximately $30.8 million) as capital contribution to Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn November 5, 2018, we changed our name to XT Energy Group, Inc. through a merger with and into our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of affecting the name change.\nOn May 24, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d), discussed a plan to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership interest in Herbal Wine Co. and Wine Co. in order to shift its business focus on its energy related business. Therefore the result of operations was presented as discontinued operations as of and for the year ended July 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements.\nReorganization\nOn September 30, 2018, Xiangtian Shenzhen terminated its variable interest entity agreements (the VIE Agreements\u201d) as part of its restructuring to facilitate the shift of business focus between entities controlled by the Company. After the restructuring, the Company's headquarter is located in the city of Xianning, Hubei Province, and Sanhe Xiangtian, the Company's previous headquarter, located in the city of Sanhe, Hebei Province, is restructured as our sales office. The VIE Agreements include the following:\n \u25cf Framework Agreement on Business Cooperation, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; \n \u25cf Exclusive Management, Consulting and Training and Technical Service Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; \n \u25cf Exclusive Option Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and all the shareholders of Sanhe Xiangtian ( Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders\u201d); \n \u25cf Equity Pledge Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and among Xiangtian Shenzhen, Sanhe Xiangtian and the Shanhe Xiangtian Shareholders; \n \u25cf Know-How Sub-License Agreement, dated July 25, 2014, by and between Xiangtian Shenzhen and Sanhe Xiangtian; and \n \u25cf Powers of Attorney of the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders dated July 25, 2014. \nIn connection with the termination of the VIE Agreements, on September 30, 2018, Sanhe Xiangtian transferred its 100% equity interest of Xianning Xiangtian to the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders and the Sanhe Xiangtian Shareholders transferred their 100% equity interest of Sanhe Xiangtian to Xianning Xiangtian. As a result of the foregoing equity transfers, Sanhe Xiangtian became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xianning Xiangtian.\nOn the same day, the Company, through Xiangtian Shenzhen and Xiangtian HK, entered into a new series of variable interest entity agreements ( New VIE Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which Xianning Xiangtian became the Company's new contractually controlled affiliate. The New VIE Agreements allow us to:\n \u25cf exercise effective control over Xianning Xiangtian; \n \u25cf receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Xianning Xiangtian; and \n \u25cf have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Xianning Xiangtian when and to the extent permitted by the laws of the PRC. \nAs a result of the New VIE Agreements, we have become the primary beneficiary of Xianning Xiangtian, and it treats Xianning Xiangtian as its variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP. We will continue to consolidate the financial results of Xianning Xiangtian in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above reorganization has no effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the current period and thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statement of the Company for the years ended July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and related notes thereto.\nThe Year Ended July 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2018\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue was derived from the installation of power generation systems, the sales of PV panels and others, air compression equipment and other components, heat pump products, high-grade synthetic fuel products, and hydraulic parts and electronic components for the year ended July 31, 2019.\nTotal revenues increased by $37,857,125 or 247.9%, to $53,126,913 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $15,269,788 for the year ended July 31, 2018.

$12,910,123 during the year ended July 31, 2019 from $2,638,324 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increase in revenues contributed by PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, our overall gross profit percentage was 24.3% and 17.3%, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in sales of our air compression equipment and other components, high-grade synthetic fuel products and hydraulic parts and electronic components, which generally have a higher gross profit percentage.\nGross profit percentage for our installation of power generation systems revenue was 8.2% and 13.5% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage is mainly due to our final installation project for the year ended July 31, 2019 has a lower gross profit percentage as the project is smaller in size with a lesser profit margin.\nGross profit percentage for PV panels and others revenue was 9.5% and 13.0% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for air compression equipment and other components revenue was 18.5% and 17.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for heat pumps revenue was 16.7% and 28.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to the increase in sales volume as we expanded our business by lowering prices to attract more sales volume, which resulted in lower gross profit percentage in the current period.\nGross profit percentage for high-grade synthetic fuel revenue was 38.5% and 38.3% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The slightly increase in gross profit percentage is mainly due to new value-added taxes rate enacted in April 2019 from 16% to 13% for which we were able to slightly increasing our unit selling price which caused the gross profit percentage to be slightly increased.\nGross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue was 62.6% and 15.8% for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to we obtaining a few large specialty governmental contracts with higher selling price during the year ended July 31, 2019, which increased our gross profit percentage to 62.6%. Historically, our gross profit has been around 45% to 60% depends on the market price of steel, our major raw materials cost. On the other hand, we acquired Hubei Jinli for the hydraulic parts and electronic components operations at the end of June 2018. We wrote off approximately $58,000 of raw materials in July 2018 and our gross profit for July 2018 of Hubei Jinli became lower than our average gross profit. As a result, our gross profit percentage for hydraulic parts and electronic components revenue increased from 15.8% in the year ended July 31, 2018 to 62.6% in the year ended July 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $8,085,164 or 231.8% from $3,487,755 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $11,572,919 during the same period in 2019. The increase in operating expenses was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in selling expenses of $1,370,010, (ii) the increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,306,210, (iii) the increase in research and development expenses of $319,539, (iv) the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $541,687 as we have more aged receivables, (v) the increase in impairment loss of intangible assets and goodwill of $983,603 as we determined that Tianjin Jiabaili Petroleum Products Co. Ltd.'s ( Tianjin Jiabaili\u201d) operation would not be able to begin production due to misrepresentation of the production facility of Tianjin Jiabaili from the former shareholders of Tianjin Jiabiali, (vi) the increase in impairment loss of deposit for investment of $320,457 as we were not able to collect the investment deposit after exhaustive efforts at collection were made, and (vii) the increase in change in estimated contingent liabilities of $243,658 as Hubei Jinli Hydraulic Co., Ltd.'s ( Jinli\u201d) operation result were better than our previous estimates at July 31, 2018 for profit sharing clause payable to the former shareholder of Jinli for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2018.\nThe increase in selling expenses of approximately $1,370,000 was mainly attributable to the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses and benefits of approximately $212,000, and the increase in commission of approximately $495,000 due to the increased number of sales representatives and the increase in shipping expense of approximately $652,000 as a result of the increase in products sold. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $4,306,000 was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in salaries, social insurance expenses, and benefits expenses of approximately $1,056,000, (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $388,000, (iii) the increase in rent and property management expenses of approximately $524,000, (iv) the increase in utility expenses of approximately $221,000, (v) the increase in travel expenses of approximately $86,000, (vi) the increase of meal and entertainment expenses of approximately $128,000 and (vii) the increase in professional fees including legal fees, audit fees and consulting fees of approximately $1,397,000. The above increases were mainly attributable to the added operations from PV panels business, established in March 2018, high-grade synthetic fuel business, established in April 2018, and hydraulic parts and electronic components business, acquired in June 2018. This increase is offset by (i) approximately $101,000 decrease in services expenses and (ii) approximately $74,000 decrease in inspection expenses.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nFor the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, we have incurred R&D expense of $323,216 and $3,677, respectively. The increase of R&D expenses are mainly due to our research and development costs incurred on improving our hydraulic parts and electronic components products as well as researching and developing new high-grade synthetic fuel products.\nOther (Expenses) Income, Net\nTotal other expenses increased by $893,255 or 331.0% from $269,844 during the year ended July 31, 2018 to $1,163,099 during the year ended July 31, 2019. The increase in total other expenses was mainly attributable to the increase in interest expense as a result of the third party loans that we obtained in 2018 to pay for the initial payments in relation to the acquisition of Hubei Jinli and Tianjin Jiabaili in June 2018. In addition, Hubei Jinli had existing bank loans prior to our acquisition. We also obtained a new related party loan in January 2019 for the payments in relation to the acquisition of Wine Co. and Herbal Wine Co. As a result, we incurred approximately $462,000 interest expense for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, the acquisition of Hubei Jinli also includes three installment payments each due on June 20 of 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, which resulted in amortization of debt discount of our investment payable of approximately $493,000 for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018. Furthermore, we made the payment for acquisition of Hubei Jinli prior to the original due date, as a result, we recognized a one-time finance expenses of approximately $490,000 at the time for which the discount portion of the payment for the original due date were prepaid for the year ended July 31, 2019 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur current income tax expense was $1,964,238 and $180,147 for the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
