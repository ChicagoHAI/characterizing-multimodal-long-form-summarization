This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. This section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Wesbanco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-looking statements in this report relating to Wesbanco's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with Wesbanco's Form 10-Qs for the prior quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020, respectively, and documents subsequently filed by Wesbanco which are available at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov or at Wesbanco's website, www.wesbanco.com. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements, which are not historical fact, involve risks and uncertainties, including those detailed under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such statements are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements, including, without limitation, the effects of changing regional and national economic conditions including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and associated interest rate sensitivity; sources of liquidity available to Wesbanco and its related subsidiary operations; potential future credit losses and the credit risk of commercial, real estate, and consumer loan customers and their borrowing activities; actions of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the SIPC, and other regulatory bodies; potential legislative and federal and state regulatory actions and reform, including, without limitation, the impact of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act; adverse decisions of federal and state courts; fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; cyber security breaches; competitive conditions in the financial services industry; rapidly changing technology affecting financial services; marketability of debt instruments and corresponding impact on fair value adjustments; and/or other external developments materially impacting Wesbanco's operational and financial performance. Wesbanco does not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWesbanco's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by Wesbanco are included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and this MD&A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management has identified the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and business combinations to be the accounting estimates that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Credit Losses- In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\u201d which require entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model, also referred to as the current expected credit loss model ( CECL\u201d) on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses in a manner similarly to current procedures, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. Entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information they use to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\u201d and in May 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Targeted Transition Relief. Public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Wesbanco was effective January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' adoption of the CECL methodology. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase-in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an optional extension of the regulatory capital transition, which allows for a two-year delay and then a three-year transition period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each\nquarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, (collectively, the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment\u201d). Wesbanco has elected to defer the impact of CECL on its regulatory capital for two years and then will phase-in the impact of the adoption of this standard on the regulatory capital calculations over the subsequent three-year period.\nUnder CECL, acquired loans or pools of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration are deemed to be purchased credit-deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans, and are grossed-up on day 1 by the initial credit estimate through the allowance as opposed to a reduction in the loan's amortized cost. The credit mark on acquired loans deemed not to be PCD loans are reflected as a reduction in the loan's amortized cost, with an allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses recorded in the first reporting period after acquisition through current period earnings, while the loan mark will accrete through interest income over the life of such loans. At acquisition, Wesbanco will consider several factors as indicators that an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loans 30 days or more past due, loans with an internal risk grade of below average or lower, loans classified as non-accrual by the acquired institution, materiality of the credit and loans that have been previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d). Upon adoption of this standard, acquired loans from prior acquisitions that met the guidelines under ASC 310-30 (formerly known as purchased credit-impaired\u201d) were reclassified as PCD loans. The accretable portion of the loan mark as of adoption date continues to accrete into interest income. However, the non-accretable portion of the loan mark was added to the allowance upon adoption, and any reversals of such mark will flow through the allowance in future periods. The loan mark on ASC 310-20 loans ( non-purchased credit-impaired\u201d) from prior acquisitions continues to accrete through interest income over the life of such loans.\nThe day 1 impact on the allowance for credit losses was $41.4 million, which included a $6.7 million adjustment for PCD loans and a $3.0 million adjustment related to loan commitments. The after-tax effect on retained earnings was $26.6 million as of January 1, 2020. The day 1 CECL calculation was derived from the selected assumption of a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast, which was obtained from a third-party vendor. After the forecast period, Wesbanco reverts back over a one-year period to historical loss rates adjusting for prepayments and curtailments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of loans. The most sensitive assumptions include the length of the forecast and reversion periods, forecast of unemployment and interest rate spreads and prepayment speeds. See Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d for further detail.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected credit losses at the initial origination date. Similarly, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities, represents expected losses on unfunded commitments. Fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses specific to loans, the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities are recognized in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of operations. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.\nThe allowance for credit loss calculation specific to loans is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, which is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, deferred loan fees (costs) and acquired premium (discount) minus any write-downs. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, because the Company has a robust policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when the loan is placed on non-accrual, and also made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income. However, Wesbanco is reserving, as part of the allowance for credit losses, for accrued interest on loan modifications under the CARES Act due to the nature and timing of these deferrals.\nThe allowance for credit loss specific to loans reflects the risk of loss in the loan portfolio. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes the probability of default ( PD\u201d) / loss given default ( LGD\u201d) approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rate spreads. Management relies on macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable sources, which may include the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) forecast and other third party forecasts from well recognized, leading economists. These forecasts can range from one to two years, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management's judgement of what can be reasonably supported. The model reversion period may range from one to three years.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans is calculated over the loan's contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the internal review date. For all other revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. The contractual term does not include any expected extensions, renewals or modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation as of the reporting period that Wesbanco will execute a troubled debt restructuring, TDR, with the borrower. Management assumes a loan will become a TDR if a loan has matured, has a principal balance, and has previously been partially charged-off. This assumption extends the maturity of these loans to six months beyond their respective maturity dates.\nContractual terms are adjusted for estimated prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. Wesbanco models term loans with an annualized prepayment\u201d rate. When Wesbanco has a specific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.\nThe evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, volume of activity, changes in lending staff, type of collateral and the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the actual historical loss rates to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio. Due to the current economic environment caused by the pandemic, management has included COVID-19 pandemic factors related to the transient credit risk not covered by the traditional allowance process, adjusted to Wesbanco's regional footprint, deferred interest on modified loans, and hospitality industry concentration.\nCommercial loans, including commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) and C&I, are individually-evaluated if they have unique characteristics, reported as TDRs, or reported as non-accrual loans and greater than $1 million in balance. Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d allows financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 7, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised),\u201d which further discusses loan modifications related to COVID-19. Wesbanco has extended loan principal and/or interest payments up to 180 days for customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These customers must meet certain criteria, such as being in good standing and not more than 30 days past due either as of December 31, 2019, or as of the implementation of the modification program under the Interagency Statement, as well as other requirements noted in the regulatory agencies' revised statement. Based on the CARES Act provision and the guidance noted above, Wesbanco does not classify the COVID-19 loan modifications as TDRs, nor are the customers considered late with regard to their delayed payments to the extent they meet the criteria. Upon exiting the loan modification deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency will resume where it was determined upon entry into the program.\nOn August 3, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations Related to COVID-19\u201d. This statement provides financial institutions with considerations for certain customers nearing the end of their COVID-19 loan deferral period noted above. As per this guidance and in accordance with the CARES Act noted above, Wesbanco developed a plan to assist certain customers with additional deferrals of principal and/or interest. This plan, mostly relating to existing commercial loans in the hospitality sector, may provide certain relief to these portfolio loans if they meet certain criteria regarding the borrower, underlying property and potential guarantors / co-borrowers. If a loan meets the criteria, it would be eligible to have twelve months of interest payments deferred or three months of principal and interest payments plus nine months of interest only payments. There are predetermined financial triggers reviewed throughout the deferred period to determine if a borrower should return to a normal amortization schedule prior to the completion of the twelve months.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted, which reauthorizes lending under the PPP loan program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021, and among other things, modifies provisions related to making PPP loans and forgiveness of PPP loans, and authorizes second draw PPP loans for borrowers that previously received a PPP loan.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets- Wesbanco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles was $1,096.8 million and $66.3 million, respectively, which represents approximately 39.8% and 2.4% of total shareholders' equity, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Wesbanco's Community Banking segment had two reporting units with goodwill.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of core deposit and customer list intangibles (long-term customer-relationship intangible assets) are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods over their weighted-average estimated useful lives, ranging from ten to sixteen years in total, and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Non-compete agreements are recognized in other assets on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective agreements, ranging from one to four years.\nWesbanco evaluates goodwill for impairment by determining if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of its reporting units. Wesbanco uses market capitalization, multiples of tangible book value, a discounted cash flow model, and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. In particular, the discounted cash flow model includes various assumptions regarding an investor's required rate of return on Wesbanco common stock, future loan loss provisions, future market spreads and net interest margins, along with various growth and economic recovery and stabilization assumptions of the economy as a whole. The resulting fair values of each method are then weighted based on the relevance and reliability of each respective method in light of the current economic environment to arrive at a weighted average fair value. The evaluation also considered macroeconomic conditions such as the general economic outlook, regional and national unemployment rates, and recent trends in equity and credit markets. Additionally, industry and market considerations, such as\nmarket-dependent multiples and metrics relative to peers, were evaluated. Wesbanco also considered recent trends in credit quality, overall financial performance, stock price appreciation, internal forecasts and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. Since adopting Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d, the impairment charge is based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.\nWesbanco completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2020 utilizing a quantitative assessment and concluded that goodwill at the reporting units was not impaired as of November 30, 2020.Additionally, Wesbanco determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 as there were no significant changes in market conditions, consolidated operating results, or forecasted future results from November 30, 2020. Due to the pandemic's effect on the economy in 2020, Wesbanco completed interim valuations of goodwill impairment at each quarter end, one of which was assisted by a third party valuation firm. None of the quarterly valuations during 2020 indicated goodwill impairment.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Wesbanco does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of $64.5 million in core deposit intangibles held at the community banking segment and $1.8 million in trust customer relationship intangibles held at the trust and investment services segment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no indicators of impairment related to intangible assets with finite useful lives.\nBusiness Combinations- Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgements. Core deposits intangibles are calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative funds and net maintenance costs.\nLoans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value with no carryover of related allowance for credit losses. Any allowance for loan loss on these pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (meaning the present value of all cash flows expected at acquisition that ultimately are not to be received). Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOn November 22, 2019, Wesbanco consummated the merger with Old Line Bancshares, Inc. ( OLBK\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Bowie, MD with approximately $3.0 billion in assets, excluding goodwill.\nNet income available to common shareholders decreased $39.5 million or 24.8% to $119.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Net income available to common shareholders excluding after-tax restructuring and merger-related expenses (non-GAAP measure) decreased $44.7 million or 26.0% to $127.1 million. These decreases reflected the impact of the 2020 adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and the impact of the current economic environment on the provision for credit losses. Net interest income improved $79.6 million or 19.9%, primarily through a 28.3% increase in average earning assets from the OLBK acquisition, partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 3.37%. The net interest margin decreased specifically due to the lower interest rate environment from the five decreases in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate, totaling 225 basis points, from July 2019 through March 2020, which was partially offset by lower funding costs. Non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a $14.5 million or 176.6% increase in mortgage banking income due to a record volume of mortgage loans sold in 2020 at higher average gain on sale margins. Non-interest expense increased $42.6 million or 13.7%, reflecting the increase in costs from the larger asset base following the OLBK acquisition.\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $0.7 billion or 4.5% compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to PPP loans. Portfolio loans of $10.8 billion increased 5.1% over the last twelve months, reflecting Wesbanco's participation in the PPP program, which resulted in $726.3 million in remaining PPP loans in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, both non-performing loans and non-performing assets as percentages of the loan portfolio and total assets were lower than at December 31, 2019, and have remained relatively consistent throughout 2020. Criticized and classified loan balances increased to 4.59% of total portfolio loans, as compared to 2.17% at December 31, 2019 due in part to the third and fourth quarter net downgrades of $209.9 million of hospitality loans as a result of reduced occupancy and debt service coverage from the current pandemic-driven environment. As a result of a combination of the pandemic and the implementation of the CECL accounting standard, the provision for credit losses increased to $107.7 million for the year as compared to $11.2 million in 2019. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans for the full year period were six basis points compared to nine basis points in 2019. Pandemic-related loan deferrals, under the CARES Act, have declined from $2.2 billion earlier in 2020 to $171.1 million, or 1.6% of total loans, as of December 31, with approximately $150 million of this total related to the hospitality industry.\nOn August 4, 2020, Wesbanco completed a capital raise totaling $150.0 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock evidenced in the form of depositary shares. This stock pays quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 6.75% and becomes callable on November 15, 2025. The capital raise essentially replaced the movement of Wesbanco's trust preferred securities from Tier 1 to Tier 2 risk-based capital at the end of 2019, as required for banks with total assets greater than $15 billion, which occurred following the OLBK acquisition. Wesbanco continues to maintain what we believe are strong regulatory capital ratios, which were enhanced by the capital raise, as both consolidated and bank-level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable well-capitalized\u201d standards promulgated by bank regulators and the BASEL III capital standards. At December 31, 2020, Tier I leverage was 10.51%, Tier I risk-based capital was 14.72%, total risk-based capital was 17.58%, and the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ( CET 1\u201d) was 13.40%. Tangible equity to tangible assets increased to 10.52% at period-end from 10.02% as of December 31, 2019, as the preferred stock issuance and increases in other comprehensive income and retained earnings benefitted this ratio.\nStrong earnings and improved total capital enabled Wesbanco to increase the quarterly dividend rate 3.2% to $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2020, the thirteenth increase over the last ten years, cumulatively representing a 129% increase over that period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net income available to common shareholders was $119.4 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, compared to $158.9 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, for 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 24.8% compared to 2019, while per share earnings decreased 37.5%.\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net interest income increased $79.6 million, or 19.9%, due to an increase in earning assets from the OLBK acquisition. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.37% due to the overall lower rate environment. Average loan balances increased 36.1% in 2020, mostly due to the OLBK acquisition and PPP loans as compared to 2019, as organic loan growth was mitigated from elevated levels of commercial real estate loans being refinanced in an aggressive secondary market. Total average deposits increased in 2020 by $2.8 billion or 31.5% compared to 2019, due to CARES Act stimulus deposits, PPP loans deposited in business accounts, increased personal savings and the OLBK acquisition. Certificates of deposit, which have the highest overall interest cost among deposits, increased by $371.9 million or 25.8% over the same time period due primarily to the OLBK acquisition.\nFor 2020, non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% compared to 2019. Mortgage banking income increased $14.5 million or 176.6% from 2019 to 2020 due to a record number of mortgage loan originations and mortgage loans sold to the secondary market during 2020. Other non-interest income increased by $7.4 million or 51.4% from 2019 to 2020 due primarily to a $2.7 million increase in business loan swap fee income. Somewhat offsetting these increases, service charges on deposits decreased $5.0 million or 18.7%, due to stimulus deposits and lower consumer spending resulting in fewer eligible fees. Electronic banking fees decreased $5.1 million or 22.6% due to the ongoing limitation on interchange fees resulting from the Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became effective for Wesbanco on July 1, 2019. The limitation only applies to banks with greater than $10 billion in total assets.\nThe following comments on non-interest expense exclude restructuring and merger-related expenses in both years. Non-interest expense in 2020 increased $49.3 million or 16.7% compared to 2019. With net revenue growth of 17.6% in 2020, the efficiency ratio decreased in 2020 to 56.4% from 56.7% in 2019. Salaries and wages increased $20.7 million or 15.6% compared to 2019, due to increased compensation expense from an increase in average full-time equivalent employees related to the OLBK acquisition. Employee benefits expense increased $2.4 million or 6.1% compared to 2019, specifically due to the increase in employees and a $1.1 million increase in health care costs. Net occupancy increased $5.1 million in 2020 or 22.6% compared to 2019, principally due to increased building-related costs including utilities, lease expense, depreciation, repairs and other seasonal maintenance costs, mostly from the acquired OLBK branches, as well as normal building maintenance and repair costs of the legacy branch network and other infrastructure needs. FDIC insurance expense increased $5.8 million or 295.4% in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a higher assessment rate for banks above $10 billion in assets, resulting from certain risk factors and the larger asset level following the OLBK acquisition, as well as the recording of a $3.1 million assessment credit in the second half of 2019.\nThe provision for federal and state income taxes decreased to $23.0 million in 2020 compared to $34.3 million in 2019, due to lower pretax income in 2020. The effective tax rate was 15.9% and 17.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Wesbanco recognized $2.0 million and $1.6 million in New Markets Tax Credits for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTABLE 1.

Net interest income is affected by the general level of, and changes in interest rates, the steepness and shape of the yield curve, changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as the frequency of repricing of existing assets and liabilities. Net interest income increased $79.6 million or 19.9% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to a 28.3% increase in average earning asset balances, primarily driven by the late 2019 acquisition of OLBK and related net asset accretion from purchase accounting. Average loan balances increased by 36.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, mostly due to the OLBK acquisition and partially due to $853.1 million in PPP loans mostly originated in the second quarter of 2020, as non-PPP organic loan growth was reduced due to lower loan demand during the pandemic, other than residential lending, a majority of which was sold into the secondary market. PPP loans contributed a total of $19.2 million in interest and fee accretion income in 2020. Total average deposits increased in 2020 by $2.8 billion or 31.5% compared to 2019, due to the deposits acquired from OLBK and from an influx of deposits from the stimulus packages associated with the CARES Act, PPP loan proceeds deposited into customer accounts and lower general consumer spending. Certificates of deposit, which have the highest overall interest cost among deposits, increased by only $371.9 million or 25.8% over the same time period due to runoff in higher cost certificates of deposit from prior acquisitions, including OLBK. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points in 2020 to 3.37% from 3.62% in 2019. The margin's decline was due to multiple decreases during late 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate, a relatively flat yield curve and additional balance sheet liquidity over the year. Purchase accounting accretion from prior acquisitions benefitted both the 2020 and 2019 net interest margin by 19 basis points. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 42 basis points from 2019 to 2020. The decrease in the cost is primarily due to management actions to reduce certain interest bearing demand deposits, which include public funds, and lower rates for certificates of deposit, customer repurchase agreements, short to medium-term Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and subordinated and junior subordinated debt.\nInterest income increased $57.0 million or 11.8% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher overall earning assets, particularly from the OLBK acquisition and PPP loan originations, and was partially offset by lower yields in every earning asset category. Earning asset yields were influenced negatively in 2020 compared to 2019 due to multiple federal funds rate decreases totaling 225 basis points occurring throughout the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Average loan balances increased by $2.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to the acquisition of OLBK and PPP loan originations. Loan yields decreased by 64 basis points during this same period to 4.28% from the previously mentioned federal funds rate decreases and originations of PPP loans. Loans provide the greatest impact on interest income and the yield on earning assets as they have the largest balance and the highest yield within major earning asset categories. In 2020, average loans represented 75.6% of average earning assets, an increase from 71.3% in 2019. Average taxable securities balances decreased by $84.7 million or 3.6% from 2019, due to higher levels of calls and mortgage security-related paydowns in the lower rate environment. In addition, approximately $218 million of mortgage-backed securities were sold at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to take advantage of market opportunities and to boost liquidity for COVID-19 related reasons. Taxable securities yields decreased by 42 basis points and tax-exempt securities yields decreased by two basis points in 2020 as compared to 2019. The flat yield curve and lower overall rate environment that persisted through most of 2020 has resulted in the yield decrease for all securities as calls, repayments and maturities of legacy higher-rate securities have been replaced with purchases at lower overall market yields. Increased prepayments on mortgage-backed securities in the lower rate environment also acts to reduce the taxable securities yields due to an increased rate of amortization of certain premium securities. The average balance of tax-exempt securities, which have the highest yields within securities, decreased to 21.3% of total securities in 2020, compared to 23.4% in 2019, primarily due to increased calls on tax-exempt securities in the second half of the year as market rates began to decrease.\nTotal portfolio loans increased $521.2 million or 5.1% over the last twelve months, while total commercial loans increased $743.1 million or 10.1%. Loan growth was achieved through $4.6 billion in total loan originations, led by $2.8 billion in business loan originations for the past twelve months. Loan growth was driven by PPP loans, expanded market areas and additional commercial personnel in our core markets, but was partially offset by significant loan paydowns or payoffs as some loans were refinanced in the secondary lending market or with other banks by customers who desired better terms and longer maturities for their commercial real estate mortgages, and some financed projects were sold by their developers.\nCommercial loans with floors currently average 4.22% on approximately $2.3 billion or 29% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.4 billion averaging 4.50% or 33% of commercial loans at December 31, 2019. Approximately 69% or $1.6 billion of these loans are currently priced at their floor, as compared to 49% or $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. These loans typically do not adjust as rapidly from their current floor level as compared to loans without floors, due to the amount of the rate change as compared to the floor rate or next repricing date. In addition, in a declining rate environment, some customers may request rates below existing contractual floors, which we may grant for competitive or other reasons.\nInterest expense decreased $22.6 million or 26.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to decreases in the cost of all interest bearing liability categories, as market rates dropped in reaction to COVID-19 and management reduced certain deposit rates, as well as higher time deposit purchase accounting accretion. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 42 basis points from 1.05% in 2019 to 0.63% in 2020. Average interest bearing deposits increased by $1.6 billion or 24.9% from 2019, due to the OLBK acquisition and increases in organic deposits heavily driven by CARES Act stimulus deposits. The rate on interest bearing deposits decreased by 34 basis points from 2019 to 33 basis points in 2020, primarily from aggressive decreases in rates on interest bearing public funds and certificates of deposit in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased from 2019 to 2020 by $1.2 billion or 48.2% and were 31.9% of total average deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 28.3% at December 31, 2019, reflecting the acquired OLBK non-interest bearing demand deposits, CARES Act stimulus deposits, PPP loan deposits, higher personal savings and ongoing checking account marketing strategies. The average balance of FHLB borrowings increased by $61.2 million from 2019 to 2020, but their average rate paid decreased by 30 basis points to 2.17% over this same time period due to lower interest rates. In the second half of 2020, Wesbanco paid off approximately $580.0 million in maturing borrowings that had higher average rates with available liquidity. Average other borrowings, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt balances increased by $62.2 million or 12.7% from 2019 to 2020, due primarily to the OLBK acquisition, and their average rates paid decreased by 122 and 94 basis points, respectively, over this same time period due to decreases in LIBOR, the index upon which most of this variable-rate type of borrowing is priced, other than fixed rates on $35.1 million of subordinated debt.\nTABLE 2.

The provision for credit losses - loan commitments is the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for loan commitments to bring that allowance to a level considered appropriate to absorb lifetime expected losses on unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses - loans and loan commitments increased to $107.7 million in 2020 compared to $11.2 million in 2019 due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, and as a result of changes in the macroeconomic forecast resulting in expected significantly higher unemployment over the reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year, primarily increasing the allowance for loan losses and allowance for loan commitments. Non-performing loans were 0.38% of total loans as of December 31, 2020, decreasing from 0.49% of total loans at the end of 2019. Non-performing assets were 0.38% of total loans and other real estate and repossessed assets as of December 31, 2020, decreasing from 0.53% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Criticized and classified loans were 4.59% of total loans, increasing from 2.17% as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to recent adjustments to the internal loan classification system, which impacted risk grades, and downgrades in the Company's hospitality loan portfolio. Past due loans at December 31, 2020 were 0.37% of total loans, compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2019. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $100.6 million and $3.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Wesbanco offers its customers a wide range of retail, commercial, investment and electronic banking services, which are viewed as a vital component of Wesbanco's ability to attract and maintain customers, as well as providing additional fee income beyond normal spread-related income to Wesbanco. Non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, due specifically to record income levels recorded in mortgage banking income and swap fee and valuation income. The increases were somewhat offset by the Durbin amendment and its impact on electronic banking fees as well as the COVID-19 impact on several revenue streams.\nTrust fees decreased $0.2 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a lower average market value of trust assets in the first half of 2020 as compared to 2019; however, fee decreases were mitigated following substantial market improvements in the second half of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, total trust assets of $5.0 billion increased 6.4% from $4.7 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, trust assets include managed assets of $4.1 billion and non-managed (custodial) assets of $0.9 billion. Assets managed for the WesMark Funds, a proprietary group of mutual funds for which Wesbanco Investment Department serves as investment advisor, were $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2019, and are included in trust managed assets.\nService charges on deposits decreased $5.0 million or 18.7% compared to the prior year due to higher consumer deposit balances throughout most of 2020 associated with CARES Act stimulus payments and lower general consumer spending during pandemic-related lockdowns, resulting in fewer eligible fee-generating transactions.\nElectronic banking fees, which include debit card interchange fees, decreased by $5.1 million or 22.6% compared to 2019, specifically due to 2020 being the first full year of the ongoing limitation on interchange fees resulting from the Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became effective for Wesbanco on July 1, 2019. The limitation only applies to banks with greater than $10 billion in total assets. Lower consumer spending, particularly during the spring government-required lockdowns, prevented normal spending patterns and transaction counts temporarily reducing fees. Slightly offsetting the effect of the Durbin amendment was a higher volume of transactions resulting from the OLBK acquisition and increased transactions in the back part of the year from internet and mobile sources.\nBank-owned life insurance increased $1.4 million or 24.5% compared to 2019 due to higher mortality-related benefits received in 2020 as well as an increase in the average cash surrender value balance during 2020, due to the bank-owned life insurance acquired in the OLBK acquisition.\nMortgage banking income increased $14.5 million or 176.6% compared to 2019 due to a record volume of mortgage production, particularly from refinance activity, and loans sold into the secondary market resulting from the low interest rate environment in 2020. Total mortgage production was $1.3 billion in 2020, an increase of 102.7% from $653.2 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $679.7 million of mortgages were sold into the secondary market at a net margin of 3.3% as compared to $287.4 million sold at a net margin of 2.9% in the comparable 2019 period. Included in mortgage banking income and the calculation of net margin noted above are losses of $5.2 million and $1.4 million from the fair value adjustments on loans held for sale, loan commitments and related derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDebit card sponsorship income is a new revenue stream for Wesbanco that was acquired in the OLBK acquisition on November 22, 2019. The fees are earned from Wesbanco's sponsorship of certain customers into various debit networks and are generated from the total\ntransactions processed on the debit networks. Debit sponsorship income was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2019 debit card sponsorship income of $0.3 million included only slightly more than one month of activity from OLBK's acquisition date. Wesbanco currently plans to reduce this program's customer-related revenues over the next year for risk-related reasons, either from a sale of the business or winding down of activity.\nSwap fee and valuation income increased $2.7 million or 79.4% compared to 2019 due to a record volume of new loan swaps executed during the year, somewhat offset by negative fair value adjustments on existing swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2020, new swaps executed during the year totaled $331.0 million resulting in $8.1 million of fee income, compared to new swaps executed of $193.7 million resulting in $4.5 million of fee income for the year ended December 31, 2019. Fair value adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were ($2.0) million and ($1.1) million, respectively.\nTABLE 5.

to 2019, principally from the OLBK acquisition, which increased assets by $3.0 billion, excluding goodwill, and added 37 offices to our branch network. In 2020, there were $9.7 million of merger-related expenses related to the OLBK acquisition and branch optimization restructuring charges compared to $16.4 million in merger-related expenses in 2019 for the OLBK and FFKT acquisitions. Non-interest expense, excluding merger-related expenses, increased $49.3 million or 16.7% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nSalaries and wages increased $20.7 million or 15.6% compared to 2019, due to increased compensation expense related to a 10.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) related to the OLBK acquisition and from annual merit increases in mid-2020. Employee benefits expense increased $2.4 million or 6.1% compared to 2019, specifically due to an increase in FTEs and related payroll taxes along with a $1.1 million increase in health care costs, and was partly offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in pension expense. Market adjustments of the underlying investments of the deferred compensation plan, for which a corresponding entry was recorded in net securities gains (losses) also increased by $0.2 in 2020 from 2019.\nNet occupancy increased $5.1 million in 2020 or 22.6% compared to 2019, principally due to increased building-related costs including utilities, lease expense, depreciation, repairs and other seasonal maintenance costs, mostly from the acquired retail branches, as well as normal increases in building maintenance and repair costs of the legacy branch network and other infrastructure needs.\nEquipment costs increased $4.3 million or 21.0% compared to 2019 due to the OLBK acquisition and continuous improvements in technology and communication infrastructure, software costs, as well as loan and deposit origination and customer support platforms. Specifically, service agreements expense increased $2.3 million or 20.8% from 2019 to 2020.\nFDIC insurance increased $5.8 million or 295.4% compared to 2019, due to both a larger assessment base from the OLBK acquisition and also due to a $3.4 million assessment credit that was utilized to reduce expense in 2019. During September 2019, the banking industry was notified by the FDIC that its deposit insurance fund ( DIF\u201d) reached the required minimum reserve ratio of 1.38%, permitting the FDIC to\noffset current bank assessments with prior credits from 2016 through 2018 earned by banks with less than $10 billion in assets during that time period. Wesbanco recorded its total DIF credit of $3.4 million in the second half of 2019, of which $0.3 million was related to OLBK.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million or 29.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. The OLBK acquisition added approximately $32.9 million in core deposit intangibles.\nRestructuring and merger-related expenses in 2020 were comprised of $6.4 million in final merger-related expenses related to the OLBK acquisition and $3.3 million in restructuring expenses related to the branch optimization strategy announced by Wesbanco in the third quarter. The 2020 OLBK merger-related expenses included $2.7 million in change-in-control payments, $1.7 million from contract termination and non-refundable conversion costs, $1.3 million in employee severance costs and retention bonuses, and $0.7 million in miscellaneous accounting, valuation and other charges. The branch optimization restructuring expenses were predominantly net write-downs to appraised value on owned and leased properties that were closed in January 2021.\nConsulting, regulatory, accounting and advisory fees increased $2.7 million or 30.3% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher swap clearing expense from a higher volume of cleared swaps in 2020 as compared to 2019, increased underwriting and processing fees from the record volume of mortgage originations in 2020 and higher consulting fees incurred in 2020.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe provision for federal and state income taxes decreased to $23.0 million in 2020 compared to $34.3 million in 2019. The effective tax rate was 15.9% and 17.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the provision is specifically due to the 24.9% decrease in pretax income from 2019 to 2020. Also affecting the provision were reductions from approximately $1.0 million in filed return and other miscellaneous adjustments in 2020. The effective tax rate decreased for the same reason as mentioned above and also due to the utilization of additional New Markets Tax Credits by Wesbanco in 2020. For more information on such credits, see Note 20, Wesbanco Bank Community Development Corporation\u201d.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets, deposits, and shareholders' equity increased 4.5%, 13.0%, and 6.3%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2019. Total securities decreased $535.6 million or 16.4% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the sale of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and select municipal securities, at a net gain of $2.7 million, to provide for additional liquidity related to potential COVID-19 requirements. The securities' decrease was partially offset by a $37.3 million increase in net unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio. Total portfolio loans increased $521.2 million or 5.1% as participation in the SBA PPP loan program provided approximately $726.3 million in loans remaining at December 31, 2020. Deposits increased $1.4 billion from year-end 2019 resulting from increases of 25.8%, 14.5%, and 11.0% in demand deposits, savings deposits, and money market deposits, respectively, which were partially offset by a 21.3% decrease in certificates of deposit. The growth in transaction-based accounts is primarily attributable to CARES Act stimulus funds received, increased personal savings and reduced consumer spending, focused retail and business strategies to obtain more account relationships and customers' preferences for shorter-term maturities. The transaction-based accounts also increased from business customers obtaining loans from the PPP loan program.\nDeposit balances were also somewhat impacted by bonus and royalty payments for Marcellus and Utica shale gas payments from energy companies in Wesbanco's southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and northern West Virginia markets. The decrease in certificates of deposit is a result of lower overall rates and management periodically offering lower than median competitive rates for maturing certificates of deposit and customer preferences for other deposit types, coupled with a $30.7 million decrease in CDARS\u00ae balances. The decline was also impacted by customer run-off of higher cost certificates of deposit from the OLBK and other prior acquisitions. Total borrowings decreased 48.2% or $914.6 million during 2020, as additional liquidity permitted the paydown of maturing FHLB advances, net of new borrowings, by $866.6 million, coupled with $6.7 million of junior subordinated debentures, acquired from OLBK, which were redeemed during 2020 and a $40.4 million decrease in other short-term borrowings.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $162.8 million or 6.3%, compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to $144.5 in net proceeds from the issuance of 6.0 million in depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of Wesbanco's 6.75% fixed rate reset non-cumulative perpetual series A preferred stock. Additionally, net income exceeded dividends for the year by $36.2 million and comprehensive income increased $30.2 million. Such factors were partially offset by decreases in retained earnings from the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard totaling $26.6 million and share repurchase activity of $25.4 million before suspending the program in mid-March due to the onset of the pandemic.\nSECURITIES\nTABLE 6.

as a contributor to interest income, decreased by $535.3 million or 16.4% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Throughout the year, the available-for-sale portfolio decreased by $415.4 million or 17.4% primarily due to the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities at the end of the first quarter to take advantage of market opportunities and to free cash for COVID-19 related needs, such as larger commercial or home equity line withdrawals, while the held-to-maturity portfolio decreased by $120.5 million or 14.2% due to calls of municipal securities in the current lower rate environment. The weighted average yield of the portfolio decreased 46 basis points from 2.89% at December 31, 2019 to 2.43% at December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities, calls of legacy higher-rate agency and municipal securities as market rates declined in the first half and stayed low throughout 2020, and purchases at the lower market rates throughout the year.\nTotal gross unrealized securities losses decreased $5.6 million, from $7.4 million at December 31, 2019 to $1.8 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in unrealized losses from December 31, 2019, was due to decreases in market rates during 2020 causing market prices to increase on most securities purchased or acquired in prior years. Wesbanco believes that none of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2020 requires an allowance for credit losses. Please refer to Note 4, Securities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Wesbanco does not have any investments in private mortgage-backed securities or those that are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, nor does Wesbanco have any exposure to collateralized debt obligations or government-sponsored enterprise preferred stocks.\nNet unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $46.9 million and $20.7 million, respectively. These net unrealized pre-tax gains represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to fixed yields in the available-for-sale portfolio, and on an after-tax basis are accounted for as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized pre-tax gains in the held-to-maturity portfolio, which are not accounted for in other comprehensive income, were $37.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $22.8 million at December 31, 2019. With approximately 27% of the investment portfolio in the held-to-maturity category, compared to 26% one year ago, the recent volatility in interest rates does not have as much impact on other comprehensive income as if the entire portfolio were included in the available-for-sale category.\nEquity securities, of which a portion consist of investments in various mutual funds held in grantor trusts formed in connection with a key officer and director deferred compensation plan, are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses due to fair value fluctuations on equity securities are included in net securities gains or losses. For those equity securities relating to the key officer and director deferred compensation plan, the corresponding change in the obligation to the employee is recognized in employee benefits expense.\nOn January 1, 2020, Wesbanco adopted the CECL accounting standard. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $0.2 million to opening retained earnings, which represents the CECL allowance for held-to-maturity securities as of January 1, 2020. The corporate and municipal bonds in Wesbanco's held-to-maturity securities portfolio are analyzed quarterly to determine if any change in the allowance for current expected credit losses is warranted. Wesbanco uses a database of historical financials of all corporate and municipal issuers and actual historic default and recovery rates on rated and non-rated transactions to estimate expected credit losses on an individual security basis. The expected credit losses are adjusted quarterly and are recorded in an allowance for expected credit losses on the balance sheet, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the held-to-maturity portfolio as a contra-asset. The losses are recorded on the income statement in the provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities, which was $5.3 million as of December 31, 2020, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Held-to-maturity investments in U.S. Government-sponsored entities and agencies as well as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are all either issued by a direct governmental entity or a government-sponsored entity, have no historical evidence supporting expected credit losses; therefore, Wesbanco has estimated these losses at zero, and will monitor this assumption in the future for any macro-economic or governmental policies that could affect this assumption.\nTABLE 7.

Wesbanco validates prices received from pricing services or brokers using a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, comparison to secondary pricing services, corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant benchmark indices, review of pricing by personnel familiar with market liquidity and other market-related conditions, review of pricing service methodologies, review of independent auditor reports received from the pricing service regarding its internal controls, and through review of inputs and assumptions used in pricing certain securities thinly traded or with limited observable data points. The procedures in place provide management with a sufficient understanding of the valuation models, assumptions, inputs and pricing to reasonably measure the fair value of Wesbanco's securities. For additional disclosure relating to fair value measurement, refer to Note 17, Fair Value Measurement\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLOANS AND LOAN COMMITMENTS\nLoans represent Wesbanco's largest balance sheet asset classification and the largest source of interest income. Commercial loans include commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d), which is further differentiated between land and construction, and improved property loans; as well as other commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) loans that are not secured by real estate. Retail loans include residential real estate mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d), and loans for other consumer purposes.\nLoan commitments, which are not reported on the balance sheet, represent available balances on commercial and consumer lines of credit, commercial letters of credit, deposit account overdraft protection limits, certain loan guarantee contracts, and approved commitments to extend credit. Approved commitments, which have been accepted by the customer, are included net of any Wesbanco loan balances that are to be refinanced by the new commitment. However, typically not all approved commitments will ultimately be funded.\nLoans and loan commitments are summarized in Table 11.\nTABLE 11.

loans increased $0.5 million or 5.1% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, due to the origination of $853.1 million of PPP loans during the second and third quarters of 2020. Excluding PPP loans, total loans decreased over the last twelve months by 2.0% as a higher percentage of new residential loans originated were sold into the secondary market as opposed to holding them in the residential loan portfolio and consumer loan demand decreased as a result of the pandemic reducing consumer spending, as well as lower overall need considering CARES Act stimulus deposits. Commercial real estate loans decreased 0.3% as demand for new construction loans decreased. Commercial and industrial loans increased 2.2%. Residential real estate loans decreased 8.1% over the last twelve months, due to a greater portion of new originations sold into the secondary market and a greater portion of existing loans refinanced with other banks, while home equity loans were also refinanced into first mortgages due to customer preferences for fixed rate loans. Portfolio loans are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of deferred loan fees and costs, and discounts on purchased loans. The net deferred loan income (costs) were $6.2 million and ($4.8) million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Wesbanco conducts a deferred loan cost study to determine the allowable costs to be deferred over the life of the loan. Excluding the effect of PPP loans, in the most recent study, Wesbanco's deferred costs have increased at a faster rate than the related customer deferred fee income causing the balance of the deferred loan costs to outweigh the deferred loan fees primarily from home equity lines of credit, which have little fee income. Purchased loan discounts from acquisitions included in the portfolio loan balances were $39.4 million and $51.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Loan accretion included in interest income on loans acquired from prior acquisitions was $17.0 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As part of loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2020, PPP loan fees were $13.4 million. At December 31, 2020, $13.8 million of unaccreted net deferred fee income remains on the PPP loans.\nCRE loans represent a significant component of the loan portfolio at 52.1% of the total portfolio, which was a 0.3% decrease in loan balances for the year. CRE-land and construction loan balances decreased $108.9 million or 14.0% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, while CRE-improved property loans increased $89.3 million or 1.8% during the same period.\nC&I loans increased $762.7 million or 46.4% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, due to PPP loans. The available lines of credit within C&I loans increased 54.8% to 66.1% of total C&I revolving lines of credit exposure as of December 31, 2020. The acquisitions of FTSB, FFKT and OLBK resulted in obtaining new customer relationships and provides new opportunities in the Huntington, WV market and an expanded presence in the greater Lexington, Frankfort, Elizabethtown, Louisville, KY, and Cincinnati, OH markets, as well as new markets in Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, MD; Lexington Park, MD; and Frederick - Gaithersburg - Rockville, MD MSAs.\nResidential real estate mortgage loans decreased $152.7 million or 8.1% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, due to increased secondary market sales. Wesbanco retained approximately 38.1% of mortgages by dollar volume originated in 2020 for the portfolio compared to 52.4% in 2019. Management's focus was to originate more loans for the secondary market, particularly longer-term refinanced mortgage loans. As mortgage rates change, management adjusts loans sold into the secondary market at higher gain-on-sale margins versus retaining balances in the loan portfolio, somewhat dependent upon customer demand for various mortgage products and related terms.\nHELOC loans decreased $3.3 million or 0.5% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to lower demand and refinancing into first mortgage loans at low, fixed rates.\nConsumer loans decreased $65.9 million or 17.6% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to a decreased focus on indirect automobile loans.\nTotal loan commitments decreased $34.5 million or 1.1% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Commitments in the total CRE portfolio decreased approximately $324.3 million or 28.7%, C&I commitments increased $85.0 million or 8.4% and HELOC commitments increased $45.4 million or 6.5%. Lower CRE commitments are the result of lower demand for new construction loans, particularly hospitality-related, during the pandemic.\nGeographic Distribution -Wesbanco extends credit primarily within the market areas where it has branch offices or markets adjacent thereto. Loans outside of these markets are generally only made to established customers that have other business relationships with Wesbanco in its markets. Loans outside of Wesbanco's markets represented approximately 1% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These loans consist primarily of CRE-improved property loans, residential real estate loans for second residences or vacation homes, consumer purpose lines of credit to wealth management customers, and automobile loans to family members of local customers. Management does not plan to significantly increase out-of-market loans.\nThe geographic distribution of the loan portfolio, excluding deposit overdraft limits and loans held for sale, is summarized in Table 12.\nTABLE 12.

Other Kentucky locations include the Elizabethtown KY MSA along with other Kentucky locations that are not located within an MSA. Through the acquisition of OLBK, Wesbanco added the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD MSA, Frederick-Gaithersburg-Rockville, MD MSA and Washington DC-Arlington-Alexandria, VA MSA as well as other Maryland locations. Adjacent states include parts of Delaware and Tennessee that are within close proximity to Wesbanco's markets. Outside-of-market loans consist of loans in all other locations not included in any of the other defined areas and have remained relatively unchanged over the past few years.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe risk that borrowers will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations is inherent in all lending activities. Repayment risk can be impacted by external events such as adverse economic conditions, social and political influences that impact entire industries or major employers, individual loss of employment or other personal calamities and changes in interest rates. This inherent risk may be further exacerbated by the terms and structure of each loan as well as potential concentrations of risk. The primary goal of managing credit risk is to minimize the impact of all of these factors on the quality of the loan portfolio.\nCredit risk is managed through the initial underwriting process as well as through ongoing monitoring and administration of the portfolio. Credit policies establish standard underwriting guidelines for each type of loan and require an appropriate evaluation of the credit characteristics of each borrower. This evaluation focuses on the sufficiency and sustainability of the primary source of repayment, the adequacy of collateral, if any, as a secondary source of repayment, potential for guarantor support, as a tertiary source of repayment and other factors unique to each type of loan that may increase or mitigate their risk. The manner and degree of monitoring and administration of the portfolio varies by type and size of loan.\nCredit risk is also managed by closely monitoring delinquency levels and trends and initiating collection efforts at the earliest stage of delinquency. Wesbanco also monitors general economic conditions, including unemployment, housing activity and real estate values in its markets. Underwriting standards are modified when appropriate based on market conditions, the performance of one or more loan categories, and other external factors. An independent loan review function also performs periodic reviews of the portfolio to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of underwriting, loan documentation and portfolio administration.\nEach category of loans contains distinct elements of risk that impact the manner in which those loans are underwritten, structured, documented, administered and monitored. Customary terms and underwriting practices, together with specific risks associated with each category of loans and Wesbanco's processes for managing those risks are discussed in the remainder of this section.\nCommercial Loans -The commercial portfolio consists of loans to a wide range of business enterprises of varying size. Many commercial loans often involve multiple loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers, therefore the potential for loss on any single transaction can be significantly greater for commercial loans than for retail loans. Commercial loan risk is mitigated by limiting total credit exposure to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries and geographic markets and by requiring appropriate collateral or guarantors.\nCommercial loans are monitored for potential concentrations of loans to any one borrower or group of related borrowers. At December 31, 2020, Wesbanco's legal lending limit to any single borrower or their related interests approximated $248 million. The ten largest commercial relationships combined ranged from $690 million to $725 million during 2020. There were 13 relationships that exceeded $50 million at December 31, 2020. These large relationships generally consist of more than one loan to a borrower or their related entities. The single largest relationship exposure approximated $113 million at December 31, 2020 and consists of multiple loans to a business relationship in the lodging sector.\nCommercial loans, including renewals and extensions of maturity, are approved within a framework of individual lending authorities based on the total credit exposure of the borrower. Loans with credit exposure up to $750,000 are approved by underwriters that are not responsible for loan origination. Loans with credit exposure greater than $750,000 minimally require the approval of a commercial banking executive, and credit exposures greater than $1.5 million require approval of a credit officer that is not responsible for loan origination. In the new Mid-Atlantic market, credit exposures greater than $5 million require approval of a credit committee comprised of senior management in the market and credit officers not responsible for loan origination. Credit exposures greater than $15 million require approval of a centralized credit committee comprised of executive management, directors, and certain other non-voting qualified persons that are not responsible for loan origination. Underwriters and credit officers do not receive incentive compensation based on loan origination volume. Commercial banking executives receive incentive compensation based on multiple factors that include loan origination, net growth in outstanding loan balances, fees, credit quality and portfolio administration requirements.\nCRE - land and construction consists of loans to finance land for development, investment, use in a commercial business enterprise, agricultural or minerals extraction, construction of residential dwellings for resale, multi-family apartments and other commercial buildings that may be owner-occupied or income generating investments for the owner. Construction loans generally are made only when Wesbanco also commits to the permanent financing of the project, has a takeout commitment from another lender for the permanent loan or the loan is expected to be repaid from the sale of subdivided property. However, even if Wesbanco has a takeout commitment, construction loans are underwritten as if Wesbanco will retain the loan upon completion of construction. In recent years, due to the low interest rate environment and low property capitalization rates, many construction loans that did not have a takeout commitment when the loan originated have been sold or refinanced in the secondary market immediately upon completion of construction, at times, resulting in significant unscheduled loan payoffs.\nCRE - land and construction loans require payment of interest-only during the construction period, with initial terms ranging from six months up to three years for larger, multiple-phase projects, such as residential housing developments and large scale commercial projects. Interest rates are often fully-floating based on an appropriate index, but may be structured in the same manner as the interest rate that will apply to the permanent loan upon completion of construction. Interest during the construction period is typically included in the project costs and therefore is often funded by loan advances. Advances are monitored to ensure that the project is at the appropriate stage of completion with each advance and that interest reserves are not exhausted prior to completion of the project. In the event a project is not completed within the initial term, the loan is re-underwritten at maturity, but interest beyond the initial term must be paid by the borrower and in some instances an additional interest reserve is required as a condition of extending the maturity. Upon completion of construction, the loan is converted to permanent financing and reclassified to CRE-improved property.\nCRE - improved property loans consist of loans to purchase or refinance owner-occupied and investment properties. Owner-occupied CRE consists of loans to borrowers in a diverse range of industries and property types. Investment properties include multi-family apartment buildings, 1-to-4 family rental units, lodging and various types of commercial buildings that are rented or leased to unrelated parties of the owner.\nCRE - improved property loans generally require monthly principal and interest payments based on amortization periods ranging from ten to twenty-five years depending on the type, age and condition of the property. Loans with amortization periods exceeding twenty years typically also have a maturity date or call option of ten years or less. Interest rates are generally adjustable after a fixed period ranging from one to five years based on an appropriate index of comparable duration. Interest rates may also be fixed for longer than five years and certain loans\nfrom acquisitions may have longer initial fixed rate terms. For certain larger loans, the borrower may be required to enter into an interest rate derivative contract that converts Wesbanco's rate to an adjustable rate.\nC&I loans consist of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable, inventory and other general business purposes; term loans to finance fixed assets other than real estate, and letters of credit to support trade, insurance or governmental requirements for a variety of businesses. Most C&I borrowers are privately-held companies with annual sales up to $100 million.\nC&I term loans secured by equipment and other types of collateral generally require monthly principal and interest payments based on amortization periods up to ten years depending on the estimated useful life of the collateral, with interest rates that may be fixed for the term of the loan (potentially via an interest rate derivative contract) or adjustable after a fixed period ranging from one to seven years based on an appropriate index.\nCommercial lines and letters of credit are generally categorized as C&I but may also be categorized as CRE-improved property loans or CRE-land and construction if they are secured primarily by real estate. Lines of credit typically require payment of interest-only with principal due on demand or at maturity. Interest rates on lines of credit are generally fully-adjustable based on an appropriate short-term index. Letters of credit typically require a periodic fee with principal and interest due on demand in the event the beneficiary of the letter requests an advance on the commitment. Lines of credit may also include a fee based on the amount of the line that is not advanced. Lines and letters of credit are generally renewable or may be cancelled annually by Wesbanco, but may also be committed for up to three years for certain small business lines and certain letters of credit. Letters of credit may also require Wesbanco to notify the beneficiary within a specified time in the event Wesbanco does not intend to renew or extend the commitment.\nTable 13 summarizes the distribution of maturities by rate type for all commercial loans.\nTABLE 13.

These loans also have the unique risk that the developer or builder may not complete the project, or not complete it on time or within budget. Risk is generally mitigated by extending credit to developers and builders with established reputations who operate in Wesbanco's markets and have the liquidity or other resources to absorb unanticipated increases in the cost of a project or longer than anticipated absorption, periodically inspecting construction in progress, and disbursing the loan at specified stages of completion. Certification of completed construction by a licensed architect or engineer and performance and payment bonds may also be required for certain types of projects. Since speculative projects are inherently riskier, Wesbanco may require a specified percentage of pre-sales for land and residential development or pre-lease commitments for investment property before construction can begin.\nThe primary factors that are considered in underwriting investment real estate are the debt service coverage calculation, the net rental income generated by the property, the composition of the tenants occupying the property, and the terms of leases, all of which may vary depending on the specific type of property. Other factors that are considered include the overall financial capacity of the investors and their experience owning and managing investment property.\nRepayment of owner-occupied loans must come from the cash flow generated by the occupant's commercial business. Therefore, the primary factors that are considered in underwriting owner-occupied CRE and C&I loans are the debt service coverage calculation, the historical and projected earnings, cash flow, capital resources, liquidity and leverage of the business. Other factors that are considered for their potential impact on repayment capacity include the borrower's industry, competitive advantages and disadvantages, demand for the business' products and services, business model viability, quality, experience and depth of management, and external influences that may impact the business such as general economic conditions and social or political changes.\nThe type, age, condition and location of real estate as well as any environmental risks associated with the property are considered for both owner-occupied and investment CRE. Environmental risk is mitigated by requiring assessments performed by qualified inspectors whenever the current or previous uses of the property or any adjacent properties are likely to have resulted in contamination of the property financed. Risk is further mitigated by requiring borrowers to have adequate down payments or cash equity, thereby limiting the loan amount in relation to the lower of the cost or the market value of the property, unless there are sufficient mitigating factors that would reduce the risk of a higher loan-to-value. Market values are determined by obtaining current appraisals or evaluations, whichever is appropriate or required by banking regulations based on the amount financed prior to the loan being made. New appraisals or evaluations may be obtained throughout the life of each loan to more accurately assess current market value when the initial term of a loan is being extended, market conditions indicate that the property value may have declined, and/or the primary source of repayment is no longer adequate to repay the loan under its original terms.\nCRE loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratios are generally limited to the maximum percentages prescribed by Wesbanco credit policy or banking regulations, which range from 65% for unimproved land to 85% for improved commercial property. Regulatory guidelines also limit the aggregate of CRE loans that exceed prescribed LTV ratios to 30% of the Bank's total risk-based capital. The aggregate of all CRE loans and loan commitments that exceeded the regulatory guidelines approximated $96 million or 6% of the Bank's total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, compared to $113 million or 8% at December 31, 2019. Regardless of credit policy or regulatory guidelines, lower LTV ratios may be required for certain types of properties or when other factors exist that increase the risk of volatility in market values such as single or special-use properties that cannot be easily converted to other uses or may have limited marketability. Conversely, higher LTV ratios may be acceptable when there are other factors to adequately mitigate the risk.\nThe type and amount of collateral for C&I loans varies depending on the overall financial strength of the borrower, the amount and terms of the loan, and available collateral or guarantors. Loans secured by bank deposit accounts and marketable securities represent the lowest risk. Marketable securities are subject to changes in market value and are monitored regularly to ensure they remain appropriately margined. The total of C&I exposure secured by bank deposit accounts and marketable securities approximated $297 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $281 million at December 31, 2019. Unsecured C&I loans, which represent the highest risk, approximated $1,002 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $251 million at December 31, 2019. Of the unsecured total at December 31, 2020, $726 million are SBA-guaranteed PPP loans. Unsecured credit is only extended to those borrowers that exhibit consistently strong repayment capacity and the financial condition to withstand a temporary decline in their operating cash flows. The single largest unsecured exposure is $5.5 million. Collateral other than real estate that fluctuates with business activity, such as accounts receivable and inventory, may also be subject to regular reporting and certification by the borrower and, in some instances, independent inspection or verification by Wesbanco. Approximately $198 million or 12% of C&I exposure (excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 is secured solely by accounts receivable and inventory, compared to $199 million or 7.8% at December 31, 2019. Another $255 million or 15% of C&I exposure (excluding PPP loans) is secured by equipment or motorized vehicles at December 31, 2020, compared to $301 million or 11.9% at December 31, 2019. The remainder of the C&I portfolio is secured by multiple types of collateral, which at times includes real estate that is taken as collateral for reasons other than its value.\nMost commercial loans are originated directly by Wesbanco. Participation in loans originated by other financial institutions represents $568 million or 5.7% of total commercial loan exposure at December 31, 2020 compared to $513 million or 5.5% at December 31, 2019. Included in this total are Shared National Credits of $15 million at December 31, 2020 and $46 million at December 31, 2019. Shared National Credits are defined as loans in excess of $100 million that are financed by three or more lending institutions. Wesbanco performs its own customary credit evaluation and underwriting before purchasing loan participations. The credit risk associated with these loans is similar to that of loans originated by Wesbanco, but additional risk may arise from the limited ability to control the actions of the lead, agent or servicing institution.\nThe commercial portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk including by market, CRE property type, C&I industry, loan type and loans affected by similar external factors.\nBeginning in 2001 and revised in 2013, banks of a certain size are required to track C&I loan transactions designated as Highly Leveraged Transactions ( HLTs\u201d). Loans that meet the criteria must be of a certain size, for the purpose of a buyout, acquisition or capital distributions and meet certain leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, Wesbanco had $38.5 million or 0.4% of total commercial loan exposure designated as HLTs, as compared to $43.5 million or 0.3% as of December 31, 2019.\nDue to fluctuations in energy prices, the bank closely monitors its energy portfolio. At December 31, 2020, total exposure to core energy industries such as drilling, extraction, pipeline construction, mining equipment, investment real estate with energy-related tenants and other related support activities approximated $60 million or 0.6% of the total commercial loan portfolio, as compared to $67 million or 0.7% of the total commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Exposure to ancillary industries such as utility distribution and transportation, engineering services, manufacturers and retailers of other heavy equipment used in core energy industries, approximates an additional $113 million in exposure or 1.1% of the total loan portfolio, as compared to $94 million or 0.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Lodging properties located in the shale gas areas that may be impacted by a reduction in shale gas activities represent an additional $130 million of exposure at December 31, 2020, as compared to $119 million at December 31, 2019. The increase is due to the reclassification of two hotels in first quarter of 2020, as drilling activity expanded, and does not represent an overall increase in lodging exposure.\nTABLE 14.

Multi-family apartment exposure increased 25.8% from $794 million at December 31, 2019 to $1,000 million at December 31, 2020. This exposure represents 59.3% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, up from 53.0% at December 31, 2019. Approximately 54% of the total multi-family exposure is for new construction projects, many of which are expected to be refinanced in the secondary market over the next 24 months. During 2020, a number of properties were refinanced in the secondary market shortly after completion and prior to stabilization. These early payoffs enabled Wesbanco to continue to finance new multi-family projects throughout our market. The central Ohio market represents approximately 33% of the total multi-family apartment exposure as of December 31, 2020, compared to 28% at December 31, 2019, and the Maryland market represents approximately 15% of the total multi-family apartment exposure as of December 31, 2020, compared to 12% as of December 31, 2019. The Louisville KY market was the next largest market in 2020 at 10%.\nConstruction represents the second largest category of commercial loan exposure of $812 million. Construction exposure increased 2.2% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This represents 48.2% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, compared to 53.0% at December 31, 2019. Construction-coded loans are broken down between 1-4 family homes built for sale, lot development and general trade. Approximately 30% of the construction exposure is in the Maryland market and 17% is located in the upper Ohio Valley market.\nLodging represents the third largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $767 million. Due to the pandemic's effect on the lodging industry, the Bank is closely monitoring this portfolio. Lodging exposure increased 11.2% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This category represents 45.5% of risk-based capital, compared to 46.1% at December 31, 2019. Approximately 40% of lodging exposure is held in the Maryland markets and approximately 18% is held in central Kentucky.\nHealthcare represents the fourth largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $727 million. Healthcare exposure increased 11.4% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This category represents 43.1% of risk-based capital, compared to 43.5% at\nDecember 31, 2019. Approximately 26% of healthcare exposure is in central Ohio market, 18% in the upper Ohio Valley market and 16% in Maryland market.\nReal estate-other represents the fifth largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $646 million. Real estate-other exposure decreased 8.1% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This category represents 38.3% of risk-based capital, compared to 46.9% at December 31, 2019. Real estate - other consists of property types such as box stores, eating facilities and mixed use. Approximately 38% of the exposure is held in the Maryland market, 14% in the Pittsburgh/western PA market and 10% in the Lexington/central Kentucky market.\nServices represents the sixth largest category of commercial exposure with total exposure of $603 million. Services increased 17.9% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This category represents 35.8% of risk-based capital, compared to 34.1% at December 31, 2019. Approximately 29% of the exposure is held in the Maryland market and 28% is held in the upper Ohio Valley market.\nIn addition to the methods in which Wesbanco monitors the CRE portfolio for possible concentrations of risk, the regulatory agencies use a two-tiered assessment to determine whether a bank has an overall concentration of CRE lending as a percentage of bank total risk-based capital. Loan balances used to determine compliance are based upon Call Report instructions and therefore do not necessarily match the balances displayed in Table 14. The first tier measures loans for land, land development, residential and commercial construction. This tier totals $768 million or 45.5% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, compared to $792 million or 52.9% at December 31, 2019. The regulatory guidance for the first tier is 100% of total risk-based capital. The second tier measures loans included in the first tier plus multi-family apartments and other commercial investment property. This tier totals $4,229 million or 250.9% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, compared to $4,019 million or 268.2% at December 31, 2019. The regulatory guidance for the second tier is 300% of total risk-based capital. The regulatory agencies also consider whether a bank's CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more within the prior thirty-six months of the assessment date. Total CRE exposure increased $2,056 million or 90.6% for the thirty-six month period ended December 31, 2020, primarily from acquisition-related growth. Management believes that although the bank is above the 50% threshold, portfolio credit quality and our internal risk management practices mitigate the risk of continued CRE lending.\nBasel III requires banks to identify High Volatility Commercial Real Estate ( HVCRE\u201d) loans in their portfolios. These loans are subject to 150% weighting in the risk-based capital calculation, effective January 1, 2015. These regulations require, among other things, that investment CRE loans for acquisition, development or construction that are not in permanent amortizing loan status, meet the statutory LTV guidelines, have a minimum contributed equity of 15% in cash, marketable securities or contributed land at appraised value, and the loan documentation must contain a requirement that the initial capital injection remain in the project until the loan has converted to permanent financing or is paid in full. Changes to the law in May, 2018 eliminated certain CRE loan categories from being subject to the regulation, such as owner-occupied, changed contributed land value from cost to appraised value for the equity component and required only the initial capital to meet the 15% threshold remain in the project. The bank has approximately $169 million in HVCRE exposure representing 2.6% of total CRE exposure and 10.1% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020. This compares to $335 million in HVCRE exposure representing 4.9% of total CRE exposure and 22% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019. A portion of these loans are classified as HVCRE primarily for legal documentation reasons, rather than contributed equity being less than 15%.\nTABLE 15.

These deferrals consisted of $154.5 million of commercial loans, representing 1.9% of the commercial loan portfolio, with a majority of the other deferrals occurring in the residential real estate portfolio. Another $99.1 million had payment terms modified to provide in the majority of cases principal relief during 2021 in return for an enhancement in terms. Changes could include an increase in floor rates, an increase in guarantors and a change in covenants. None of the aforementioned loans were delinquent as of December 31, 2020. Wesbanco met the needs of the communities it serves by providing appropriate relief tailored to the individual needs of the customer, ranging from three months of interest-only for those minimally impacted, up to and including full principal and interest deferral for six months for those significantly impacted, while also providing additional tailored relief to the hospitality industry where appropriate. The relief was provided in as many as three phases depending on the circumstances.\nOn August 3, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations Related to COVID-19\u201d. This statement provides financial institutions with considerations for certain customers nearing the end of their COVID-19 loan deferral period noted above. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Wesbanco offered up to an additional twelve months of deferred payments to certain commercial loan customers, predominantly in the hospitality industry, based on specific criteria related to the borrower, the underlying property and the potential for guarantors/co-borrowers. For loan modifications permitted under the CARES Act and the joint interagency guidance, there were $149.5 million or 8.9% of total risk-based capital of hotel loans in deferral as of December 31, 2020. These modifications made for the hotel customers provided up to 12 months of interest-only payments. A minority of those loans had deferment of principal and interest for up to three months before reverting to interest-only payments for the remaining nine months. As a part of the modifications, a provision was included that certain financial tests would be completed quarterly during 2021, and should the customer meet certain ratios, a return to the original payment terms would recommence.\nTABLE 16.

This group is comprised of residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans.\nResidential real estate consists of loans to purchase, construct or refinance the borrower's primary dwelling, second residence or vacation home. Residential real estate also includes approximately $17 million of 1-to-4 family rental properties at December 31, 2020, a decrease from approximately $19 million at December 31, 2019. Wesbanco originates residential real estate loans for its portfolio as well as for sale in the secondary market. Portfolio loans also include loans to finance vacant land upon which the owner intends to construct a dwelling at a future date. Except for construction loans that require interest-only payments during the construction period, portfolio loans require monthly principal and interest payments to amortize the loan with terms up to thirty years. Construction periods range from six to twelve months, but may be longer for larger residences. Loans for vacant land generally begin amortizing immediately and are refinanced when the owner begins construction of a dwelling. Interest rates on portfolio loans may be fixed for up to thirty years. Adjustable rate loans are based primarily on the Treasury Constant Maturity index and can adjust annually or in increments up to 15 years, although most 30 and 15 year fixed-rate originations are sold into the secondary market.\nHELOC loans are secured by first or second liens on a borrower's primary residence or second home. HELOCs are generally limited to an amount which when combined with the first mortgage on the property, if any, does not exceed 90% of the market value. Maximum LTV ratios are also tiered based on the amount of the line and the borrower's credit history. Most HELOCs originated prior to 2005 are available for draws by the borrower for up to fifteen years, at which time the outstanding balance is converted to a term loan requiring monthly principal and interest payments sufficient to repay the loan in not more than seven years. Most HELOCs originated from 2005 through 2013 are available to the borrower for an indefinite period as long as the borrower's credit characteristics do not materially change, but may be cancelled by Wesbanco under certain circumstances. Generally, lines originated since 2013 have a 15 year draw period, a ten-year repayment period and also give borrowers the option to convert portions of the balance of their line into an installment loan requiring monthly principal and interest payments, with availability to draw on the line restored as the installment portions are repaid.\nConsumer loans consist of installment loans originated directly by Wesbanco and indirectly through dealers to finance purchases of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, boats, and other recreational vehicles; home equity installment loans, unsecured home improvement loans, and revolving lines of credit that can be secured or unsecured. The maximum term for installment loans is generally eighty-four months for automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and boats; one hundred eighty months for travel trailers; one hundred twenty months for home equity/improvement loans; and sixty months if the loan is unsecured. Maximum terms may be less depending on age of collateral. In January 2018, the bank decided to no longer underwrite indirect loans for motorcycles, recreational vehicles, trailers, boats or off-road vehicles to reduce the overall risk profile of the portfolio. Revolving lines of credit are generally available for an indefinite period of time as long as the\nborrower's credit characteristics do not materially change, but may be cancelled by Wesbanco under certain circumstances. Interest rates on installment obligations are generally fixed for the term of the loan, while lines of credit are adjustable daily based on the Prime Rate.\nTABLE 17.

Portfolio residential real estate loans are generally underwritten to secondary market lending standards using automated underwriting systems developed for the secondary market that rely on empirical data to evaluate each loan application and assess credit risk. The amount of the borrower's down payment is an important consideration for residential real estate, as is the borrower's equity in the property for HELOCs. It is common practice to finance the total amount of the purchase price of motor vehicles and other consumer products plus certain allowable additions for tax, title, service contracts and credit insurance.\nRisk is further mitigated by requiring residential real estate borrowers to have adequate down payments or cash equity, thereby limiting the loan amount in relation to the lower of the cost or the market value of the property, unless there are sufficient mitigating factors that would reduce the risk of a higher loan-to-value. Market values are determined by obtaining current appraisals or evaluations, whichever is appropriate or required by banking regulations based on the amount financed prior to the loan being made. New appraisals or evaluations are not obtained unless the borrower requests a modification or refinance of the loan or there is increased dependence on the value of the collateral because the borrower is in default.\nWesbanco does not maintain current information about the industry in which retail borrowers are employed. While such information is obtained when each loan is underwritten, it often becomes inaccurate with the passage of time as borrowers change employment. Instead, Wesbanco estimates potential exposure based on consumer demographics, market share, and other available information when there is a significant risk of loss of employment within an industry or a significant employer in Wesbanco's markets. To management's knowledge, there are no concentrations of employment that would have a material adverse impact on the retail portfolio.\nMost retail loans are originated directly by Wesbanco except for indirect consumer loans originated by automobile dealers and other sellers of consumer goods. Wesbanco performs its own customary credit evaluation and underwriting before purchasing indirect loans. The credit risk associated with these loans is similar to that of loans originated by Wesbanco, but additional risk may arise from Wesbanco's limited ability to control a dealer's compliance with applicable consumer lending laws. Indirect consumer loans represented $179 million or 58% of consumer loans at December 31, 2020 compared to $223 million or 57% at December 31, 2019.\nLoans Held For Sale -Loans held for sale consist of residential real estate loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Credit risk associated with such loans is mitigated by entering into sales commitments with third party investors to purchase the loans when they are originated. This practice has the effect of minimizing the amount of such loans that are unsold and the interest rate risk at any point in time. Wesbanco generally does not service these loans after they are sold. While most loans are sold without recourse, Wesbanco may be required to repurchase loans under certain circumstances for contractual periods of generally up to one year or less. The number and principal balance of loans that Wesbanco has been required to repurchase has not been material and therefore reserves established for this exposure are not material.\nBanks that have been acquired by Wesbanco serviced some of the residential real estate loans that were sold to the secondary market prior to being acquired. Although these loans are not carried as an asset on the balance sheet, Wesbanco continues to service these loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Wesbanco serviced loans for others aggregating approximately $21 million and $175 million, respectively. The unamortized balance of mortgage servicing rights related to these loans is approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as mortgage servicing rights from the FFKT acquisition totaling approximately $1.2 million were sold in 2020.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe quality of the loan portfolio is measured by various factors, including the amount of loans that are past due, required to be reported as non-performing, or are adversely graded in accordance with internal risk classifications that are consistent with regulatory adverse risk classifications. Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d). Non-performing assets also include real estate owned ( REO\u201d) and repossessed assets. Net charge-offs are also an important measure of credit quality. Wesbanco seeks to\ndevelop individual strategies for all assets that have adverse risk characteristics in order to minimize potential loss. However, there is no assurance such strategies will be successful and loans may ultimately proceed to foreclosure or other course of liquidation that does not fully repay the amount of the loan.\nPast Due Loans -Loans that are past due but not reported as non-performing generally consist of loans that are between 30 and 89 days contractually past due. Certain loans that are 90 days or more past due also continue to accrue interest because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection. Earlier stage delinquency requires routine collection efforts to prevent them from becoming more seriously delinquent. Early stage delinquency represents potential future non-performing loans if routine collection efforts are unsuccessful. Table 18 summarizes loans that are contractually past due 30 days or more, excluding non-accrual and TDR loans.\nTABLE 18.

</tr>\n</table>\nLoans past due 30 days or more and accruing interest and not reported as TDRs decreased $7.5 million, representing 0.37% of total loans at December 31, 2020 as compared to 0.63% at December 31, 2019. The decrease in the 30-89 day category was primarily from the acquired OLBK CRE portfolio as the Bank applied its own collection practices to OLBK's delinquent loans. The overall low level of delinquency is the result of management's continued focus on sound initial underwriting, timely collection of loans at their earliest stage of delinquency and fully integrating the acquired OLBK portfolio.\nNon-Performing Assets -Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, TDRs, REO and repossessed assets.\nLoans are categorized as TDRs when Wesbanco, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received. Concessions may include a reduction of either the interest rate, the amount of accrued interest, or the principal balance of the loan. Other possible concessions are an interest rate that is less than the market rate for loans with comparable risk characteristics, an extension of the maturity date or an extension of the amortization schedule. Loans reported in this category continue to accrue interest so long as the borrower is able to continue repayment in accordance with the restructured terms. TDRs that are placed on non-accrual are reported in the non-accrual category and not included with accruing TDRs.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual when they become past due 90 days or more unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans include certain loans that are also TDRs as set forth in Note 5, Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-accrual loans also include consumer loans that were recently discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy but for which the borrower has continued to make payments for less than six consecutive months after the discharge.\nREO consists primarily of property acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure but may also include bank premises held for sale. Repossessed assets primarily consist of automobiles and other types of collateral acquired to satisfy defaulted consumer loans.\nTable 19 summarizes non-performing assets.\nTABLE 19.

December 31, 2020. There were no TDRs greater than $1 million or more at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Accruing TDRs are not concentrated in any industry, property or type of loan; however, retail loans represent 80.5% at December 31, 2020, compared to 72.2% December 31, 2019. This includes loans that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the current or prior year; however, the borrower has not yet made payments for at least six consecutive months after the discharge.\nNon-accrual loans decreased $8.0 million or 17.9% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 primarily from one relationship in the manufacturing industry paying off their loans. Approximately $1.8 million or 5.0% of total non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 also have restructured terms that would require them to be reported as a TDR if they were accruing interest, compared to $1.4 million or 3.2% of the total at December 31, 2019.\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act allows financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. These customers must meet certain criteria, such as they were in good standing and not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, as well as other requirements. Based on this guidance, Wesbanco does not classify the COVID-19 loan modifications as TDRs, nor are the customers considered past due with regard to their delayed payments. Upon exiting the loan modification deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency will resume where it left off upon entry into the program. As of December 31, 2020, Wesbanco has offered three to twelve months of deferred payments to commercial and retail customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the type of loan and the industry-type for commercial loans. None of these loans are considered delinquent as of December 31, 2020. Total deferred interest as of December 31, 2020 was $25.6 million, which is located within accrued interest receivable on the balance sheet.\nREO and repossessed assets decreased $3.6 million or 86.9% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Wesbanco seeks to minimize the period for which it holds REO and repossessed assets while also attempting to obtain a fair value from their disposition. Therefore, the sales price of these assets is dependent on current market conditions that affect the value of real estate, used automobiles, and other collateral. The average holding period of REO approximated 18 months at December 31, 2020 compared to eight months at December 31, 2019. This longer holding period factors in the complex sale of one commercial property from a prior 2012 acquisition. Repossessed assets are generally sold at auction within 60 days after repossession. Income (expenses) associated with owning REO and repossessed assets charged\nto other expenses were $0.1 million for 2020 compared to $(0.4) million for 2019. Net gains or losses on the disposition of REO and repossessed assets are credited or charged to non-interest income and approximated $316 thousand of net gains in 2020 and $167 thousand of net gains in 2019.\nCriticized and Classified Loans -Please refer to Note 5, Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of internally-assigned risk grades for commercial loans and a summary of loans by grade. Wesbanco's criticized loans are currently protected, but have weaknesses, which if not corrected, may be inadequately protected at some future date. Classified loan grades are equivalent to the classifications used by banking regulators to identify those loans that have significant adverse characteristics. A classified loan grade is assigned to all non-accrual commercial loans and most commercial TDRs; however, TDRs may be upgraded after the borrower has repaid the loan in accordance with the restructured terms for a period of time, but such loans would generally continue to be reported as TDRs regardless of their grade. Criticized and classified loans totaled $494.9 million or 6.1% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $222.5 million or 3.0% at December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to third and fourth quarter net downgrades of $209.9 million of hospitality loans as a result of reduced occupancy and debt service coverage from the current pandemic-driven environment.\nCharge-offs and Recoveries - Total charge-offs decreased $0.1 million or 1.0% to $12.5 million, while total recoveries increased $0.4 million to $5.5 million, resulting in a decrease of $0.5 million in net charge-offs for 2020 compared to 2019. The total net loan charge-off rate of 0.06% of average loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.09% at December 31, 2019, is consistent with continued overall low levels of non-performing loans, which were limited due to CARES Act assistance from the SBA's PPP program and the ability to treat certain loan modifications as non-TDRs during 2020. Table 20 summarizes charge-offs and recoveries as well as net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans for each category of the loan portfolio.\nTABLE 20.

January 1, 2020, Wesbanco adopted CECL, which resulted in a $41.4 million increase to the allowance for credit losses. Of the $41.4 million, $38.4 million related to the loan portfolio and $3.0 million related to loan commitments. The effect on retained earnings (tax-effected) was $26.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total allowance for credit losses - loans and commitments was $195.3 million of which $185.8 million relates to loans and $9.5 million relates to loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses - loans is 1.72% of total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2020, compared to 0.51% as of December 31, 2019, when the allowance for loan losses (prior to the adoption of CECL) was $52.4 million. Excluding PPP loans of $726.3 million, the allowance for credit losses - loans is 1.85% of total portfolio loans. There is no allowance on PPP loans due to their government guarantee by the SBA.\nThe allowance for credit losses - loans individually-evaluated increased $6.2 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to PCD loans acquired from the OLBK acquisition. The allowance for credit losses-loans collectively-evaluated increased from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 by $127.2 million, which includes $31.7 million related to the adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2020.\nThe allowance for credit losses - loan commitments was $9.5 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $0.9 million as of December 31, 2019, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses - loan commitments includes a $3.0 million adjustment related to the adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2020.\nThe allowance for credit losses by loan category, presented in Note 5, Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements, summarizes the impact of changes in various factors that affect the allowance for credit losses in each segment of the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses under CECL is calculated utilizing the PD/LGD, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, loan risk grades, portfolio mix, concentrations and loan growth. For the calculation as of December 31, 2020, the forecast was based upon a blend of two nationally-recognized published economic forecasts through December 31, 2020, and is primarily driven by national unemployment and interest rate spread forecasts. Wesbanco's blended forecast of national unemployment, at year end, was projected to peak at 6.6% in the first quarter of 2021, and subsequently decrease to an average of 6.2% over the remainder of the forecast period. The calculation utilized a one-year reversion period back to the Company's historical loss rate by loan classification. Included in the qualitative factors were COVID-19 pandemic factors related to the transient credit risk not covered by the traditional allowance process, adjusted to Wesbanco's regional footprint, deferred interest on modified loans, and hospitality industry concentration.\nIf forecasted projections of national unemployment remain consistent with the forecast utilized by Wesbanco as of December 31, 2020 throughout next year, this may result in less significant future quarterly increases in the allowance for credit losses, assuming other model variables remain relatively constant.\nTable 21 summarizes the allowance together with selected relationships of the allowance and provision for credit losses to total loans and certain categories of loans.\nTABLE 21.

Commercial loans, including CRE and C&I, greater than $1 million in balance that are reported as non-accrual, troubled debt restructuring or that have other unique characteristics are tested individually for potential credit losses. Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any. The evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies pertaining to the allowance for credit losses. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is concern within the banking industry that deferrals are delaying the overall impact of COVID-19 on the loan portfolio. As such, temporary COVID-19 qualitative factors have been incorporated to recognize increased risk within the portfolio that is not captured by the quantitative output including COVID-19 pandemic factors related to the transient credit risk not covered by the traditional allowance process, adjusted to Wesbanco's regional footprint, deferred interest on modified loans, and hospitality industry concentration.\nTable 22 summarizes the components of the allowance.\nTABLE 22.

Changes in the allowance for all categories of loans also reflect the net effect of changes in historical loss rates, loan balances, specific reserves and management's judgment with respect to the impact of qualitative factors on each category of loans. A decrease in the allowance for a particular loan category generally reflects either lower loan balances, historical loss rates or reductions in non-performing and classified commercial loans. Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated as described in Table 23, the total allowance is available to absorb losses in any category of loans. However, differences between management's estimation of expected future losses and actual incurred losses in subsequent periods may necessitate future adjustments to the provision for credit losses. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb expected future losses at December 31, 2020.\nDEPOSITS\nTABLE 24.

The FDIC insures all deposits up to $250,000 per account.\nTotal deposits increased by $1.4 billion or 13.0% in 2020 primarily due to CARES Act funds received, both consumer stimulus-related and from PPP loan proceeds deposited and increased personal savings. Non-interest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits increased 28.1% and 22.6%, respectively, while savings deposits and money market deposits increased 14.5% and 11.0%, respectively, due to the aforementioned CARES Act funds received, focused retail and business strategies to obtain more account relationships and customers' overall preference for shorter-term maturities. Deposit balances were also somewhat impacted by bonus and royalty payments from Marcellus and Utica shale energy companies in Wesbanco's southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia markets totaling $65.5 million and $122.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Money market deposits were influenced through Wesbanco's increased participation in the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS\u00ae) money market deposits program. ICS\u00ae reciprocal balances totaled $513.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $232.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nCertificates of deposit decreased $437.4 million primarily due to an overall corporate strategy designed to increase and remix retail deposit relationships and reducing single-service customers with a focus on overall products that can be offered at a lower cost to Wesbanco. The decrease was also impacted by lower offered rates on certain maturing certificates of deposit and customer preferences for other non-maturity deposit types. Wesbanco does not generally solicit brokered or other deposits out-of-market or over the internet, but does participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services ( CDARS\u00ae\u201d) program. CDARS\u00ae balances totaled $42.6 million in outstanding balances at December 31, 2020, of which $0.7 million represented one-way buys, compared to $73.3 million in total outstanding balances at December 31, 2019, of which $11.8 million represented one-way buys. Certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 were approximately $381.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $524.2 million at December 31, 2019. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more were approximately $843.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Certificates of deposit totaling approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 with a cost of 0.84% are scheduled to mature within the next year. The average rate on certificates of deposit decreased 33 basis points from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.75% in 2020, with a similar decrease experienced for jumbo certificates of deposit. Wesbanco will continue to focus on its core deposit strategies and improving its overall mix of transaction accounts to total deposits, which includes offering special promotions on certain certificates of deposit maturities and savings products based on competition, sales strategies, liquidity needs and wholesale borrowing costs.\nTABLE 25.

During 2020, FHLB borrowings decreased $866.6 million from December 31, 2019, as $475.0 million in advances were offset by $1.3 billion in maturities and other principal pay downs from available liquidity. The average cost in 2020 of maturing and paid-off FHLB borrowings was 2.03%, compared to the average cost of 1.38% for new FHLB borrowings in 2020.\nWesbanco is a member of the FHLB system. The FHLB system functions as a borrowing source for regulated financial institutions that are engaged in residential and commercial real estate lending along with securities investing. Wesbanco uses term FHLB borrowings as a general funding source and to more appropriately match interest maturities for certain assets. FHLB borrowings are secured by blanket liens on certain residential and other mortgage loans with a market value in excess of the outstanding borrowing balances. The terms of the security agreement with the FHLB include a specific assignment of collateral that requires the maintenance of qualifying mortgage and other types of loans as pledged collateral with unpaid principal amounts in excess of the FHLB advances, when discounted at certain pre-established percentages of the loans' unpaid balances. FHLB stock, which is recorded at cost of $34.0 million at December 31, 2020, is also pledged as collateral for these advances. Wesbanco's remaining maximum borrowing capacity, subject to the collateral requirements noted, with the FHLB at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was estimated to be approximately $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.\nOther short-term borrowings, which may consist of federal funds purchased, callable repurchase agreements, overnight sweep checking accounts and borrowings on a revolving line of credit, decreased $40.4 million to $242.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $282.4 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in these borrowings is primarily due to a $32.9 million decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase due to moving certain customer relationships to interest-bearing demand deposits and a $7.5 million decrease in federal funds purchased. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding federal funds purchased.\nIn August 2020, Wesbanco renewed a revolving line of credit, which is a senior obligation of the parent company, with another financial institution. The revolving line of credit, which accrues interest at an adjusted LIBOR rate, provides for aggregate unsecured borrowings of up to $30.0 million. The new revolving line of credit also requires Wesbanco to maintain at all times a consolidated four quarter average return on average assets of > 0.50%, a Texas ratio of less than 25% (broadly defined as the ratio of non-performing assets to tangible common equity and the allowance for loan losses), unencumbered cash and marketable securities of at least $12.0 million, and the maintenance at all times on a consolidated basis and for the Bank a total risk-based capital ratio of > 12.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of > 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of > 7.0%. Wesbanco was in compliance with all terms and conditions at December 31, 2020. There was no outstanding balance on the line as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTABLE 27.

The amounts shown do not include future interest payments, accrued interest or other similar carrying value adjustments. Additional information related to each obligation is included in the referenced footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWesbanco's future benefit payments under pension plans are estimated based on actuarial assumptions and do not necessarily represent the actual contractual cash flows that may be required by Wesbanco in the future. Please refer to Note 13, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on employee benefit plans.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWesbanco enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, loans approved but not closed, overdraft limits and contingent obligations to purchase loans funded by other entities. Since many of these commitments expire unused or partially used, these commitments may not reflect future cash requirements. Please refer to Note 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Loans and Loan Commitments\u201d section of this MD&A for additional information.\nThe allowance for credit losses includes an allowance for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses represents the lifetime expected losses for all loans and unfunded loan commitments at the initial recognition date. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries, which also includes any necessary adjustments to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments, and such reserve is accounted for in other liabilities. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Wesbanco extended its contract with its existing core service provider for an additional seven years, which includes upgraded and enhanced technological and digital banking services. The new contract also includes additional products and services, which were previously obtained from various other third-party service providers. It is currently anticipated that such core services will be converted in the third quarter of 2021, and that any one-time charges from various contract terminations will be accounted for as of the date of the termination of any such associated contract. In addition to upgrading and enhancing technology, reflecting the current operating environment and increased utilization of digital services, Wesbanco announced, on August 27, 2020, a plan to accelerate its financial center optimization strategy. This plan consolidates a total of 25 existing locations and converts two others to drive-up only locations across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Three locations closed in 2020 and the remainder closed in January 2021. Gross cost savings of approximately $6.0 million to $6.5 million are expected to be phased-in during the first half of 2021, with approximately half of the gross cost savings reinvested in enhanced customer-facing technologies and digital services. Staff at the locations being consolidated have been permitted to fill certain open positions at other nearby financial centers, somewhat reducing expected cost savings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Wesbanco incurred $3.3 million in restructuring charges due to the disposition of assets, lease terminations, severance and other costs associated with the closures.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nShareholders' equity increased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Wesbanco issued 6.0 million depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of Wesbanco's 6.75% fixed rate reset non-cumulative perpetual Series A preferred stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering costs were approximately $144.5 million and are available to support Wesbanco's obligations, including payments related to outstanding indebtedness, to support the capital needs of the Company and the Bank, and for other general corporate purposes. Additionally, shareholders' equity was positively impacted by net income during the current year of $122.0 million and a $30.2 million other comprehensive income gain. Such factors were partially offset by the retained earnings effect of the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption totaling $26.6 million, the repurchase of common shares and restricted stock vesting activity totaling $25.3 million, and the declaration of common and preferred shareholder dividends totaling $85.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other comprehensive income gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 were due to a $28.2 million unrealized gains in the securities portfolio coupled with a $2.0 million unrealized gain in the defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefits.\nFor 2020, common dividends increased to $1.28 per share, or 3.2% on an annualized basis, compared to $1.24 per share in 2019. The common dividend per share payout ratio increased to 72.3% in 2020 from 43.8% in 2019, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings year-over-year. A board-approved policy generally targets dividends as a percent of net income in a range of 35% to 60%, subject to\ncapital levels, earnings history and prospects, regulatory concerns, and other factors. The quarterly dividend was increased again in February 2021 to $0.33 per share, or 3.1%.\nOn December 19, 2019, Wesbanco's Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a new stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to an additional 1.7 million shares of Wesbanco common stock, representing approximately 2.5% of the outstanding shares, from time-to-time on the open market, which is in addition to the existing plan approved by the Board of Directors on October 22, 2015. In the first quarter of 2020, Wesbanco purchased 786,010 shares of its outstanding common stock on the open market at a total cost of $25.0 million, or $31.77 before suspending the share buyback program in early March, in an abundance of caution related to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, the remaining shares authorized to be purchased under the current repurchase plans totaled 1,704,457 shares.\nWesbanco is subject to risk-based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet instruments. Wesbanco and its banking subsidiary Wesbanco Bank maintain Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios significantly above minimum regulatory levels. The Bank paid $64.0 million in dividends to Wesbanco during 2020, or 49% of the Bank's net income. There are various legal limitations under federal and state laws that limit the payment of dividends from the Bank to the parent company. As of December 31, 2020, under FDIC and State of West Virginia regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, dividends of approximately $306.3 million from the Bank. The Bank's policy is generally to declare dividends up to 90% of its earnings to the parent annually, subject to change, with Board approval.\nWesbanco currently has $192.3 million in subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. For regulatory purposes, the junior subordinated debt and trust preferred securities totaling $130.0 million, issued by unconsolidated trust subsidiaries of Wesbanco underlying such junior subordinated debt, are accounted for as Tier 2 capital in accordance with current regulatory reporting requirements. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule that implements the Basel III capital standards effective January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period ending January 1, 2019. The final capital rule establishes the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act, permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital issued before May 19, 2010 for bank holding companies under $15 billion, and increases the capital required for certain categories of assets. Wesbanco had $60.1 million of subordinated debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. YCB, acquired by Wesbanco in 2016 and OLBK, acquired by Wesbanco in 2019, issued $25.0 million and $35.1 million in subordinated debt, respectively. The YCB notes were issued at a fixed rate of 6.25%, mature on December 15, 2025, and became callable on December 15, 2020. Beginning on the call date, the interest rate became a variable rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 4.59% with a current rate of 4.81%. The OLBK notes have a fixed rate of 5.625%, mature on August 15, 2026, and are callable on August 15, 2021. The interest rate will become a variable rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 4.502% on the call date. The YCB notes are considered Tier 2 regulatory capital for Wesbanco and Wesbanco Bank as they were initially issued by the Bank, while the OLBK notes are considered Tier 2 regulatory capital for Wesbanco.\nPlease refer to Note 22, Regulatory Matters,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on capital amounts, ratios and minimum regulatory requirements. Also refer to Item 1. Business\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Basel III Capital Standards.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity is defined as a financial institution's capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet its obligations. An institution's obligations, and the funding sources to meet them, depend significantly on its business mix, balance sheet structure, and the cash flows of its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Institutions confront various internal and external situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk including funding mismatches, market constraints on funding sources, contingent liquidity events, changes in economic conditions, and exposure to credit, market, operation, legal and reputation risk. Wesbanco actively manages liquidity risk through its ability to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand, unexpected outflows in deposits and other borrowings as well as to take advantage of market opportunities and meet operating cash needs. This is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of securities, sufficient borrowing capacity and a stable core deposit base. Liquidity is centrally monitored by Wesbanco's Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d).\nWesbanco determines the degree of required liquidity by the relationship of total holdings of liquid assets to the possible need for funds to meet unexpected deposit losses and/or loan demands. The ability to quickly convert assets to cash at a minimal loss is a primary function of Wesbanco's investment portfolio management. Wesbanco believes its cash flow from the loan portfolio, the investment portfolio, and other sources, adequately meet its liquidity requirements. Wesbanco's net loans-to-assets ratio was 64.6% and deposit balances funded 75.7% of total assets at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table lists the sources of liquidity from assets at December 31, 2020 expected within the next year:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 905,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities with a maturity date within the next year and callable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 286,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected payments and prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized\nmortgage obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 739,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruing loans scheduled to mature\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,272,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Normal loan repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,693,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total sources of liquidity expected within the next year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,064,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Projected prepayments are based on current prepayment speeds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposit flows are another principal factor affecting overall Wesbanco liquidity. Deposits totaled $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Deposit flows are impacted by current interest rates, products and rates offered by Wesbanco versus various forms of competition, as well as customer behavior. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020, which includes jumbo regular certificates of deposit totaling $522.5 million with a weighted-average cost of 1.00%, and jumbo CDARS\u00ae deposits of $32.3 million with a weighted-average cost of 0.57%.\nWesbanco maintains a line of credit with the FHLB as an additional funding source. Available credit with the FHLB at December 31, 2020 approximated $4.1 billion, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The FHLB requires securities to be specifically pledged to the FHLB and maintained in a FHLB-approved custodial arrangement if the member wishes to include such securities in the maximum borrowing capacity calculation. Wesbanco has elected not to specifically pledge to the FHLB otherwise unpledged securities. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had unpledged available-for-sale securities with an amortized cost of $332.9 million. A portion of these securities could be sold for additional liquidity, or such securities could be pledged to secure additional FHLB borrowings. Available liquidity through the sale of investment securities is somewhat limited, as approximately 17.8% of the current available-for-sale portfolio balance is unpledged, due to the pledging agreements that Wesbanco has with their public deposit customers. Public deposit balances have increased significantly through the several acquisitions made since 2015. Wesbanco's held-to-maturity portfolio currently contains $544.2 million of unpledged securities. Most of these securities are tax-exempt municipal securities, which can only be pledged in limited circumstances. In addition, except for certain limited, special circumstances, these securities cannot be sold without tainting the remainder of the held-to-maturity portfolio. If tainting occurs, all remaining securities with the held-to-maturity designation would be required to be reclassified as available-for-sale, and the held-to-maturity designation would not be available to utilize for some time.\nWesbanco participates in the Federal Reserve Bank's Borrower-in-Custody Program ( BIC\u201d), whereby Wesbanco pledges certain consumer loans as collateral for borrowings. At December 31, 2020, Wesbanco had a BIC line of credit totaling $186.6 million, none of which was outstanding. Alternative funding sources may include the utilization of existing overnight lines of credit with third-party banks totaling $275.0 million, none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2020, along with seeking other lines of credit, borrowings under repurchase agreement lines, increasing deposit rates to attract additional funds, accessing brokered deposits, or selling securities available-for-sale or certain types of loans.\nOther short-term borrowings of $242.0 million at December 31, 2020 consisted of callable repurchase agreements and overnight sweep checking accounts for commercial customers. There has been an increase of $24.0 million in the average deposit balances of overnight sweep checking accounts during 2020 primarily from the OLBK acquisition. The overnight sweep checking accounts require U.S. Government securities to be pledged equal to or greater than the average deposit balance in the related customer accounts.\nThe principal sources of parent company liquidity are dividends from the Bank, $223.2 million in cash on hand, and a $30.0 million revolving line of credit with another bank, which did not have an outstanding balance at December 31, 2020. Wesbanco is in compliance with all loan covenants. There are various legal limitations under federal and state laws that limit the payment of dividends from the Bank to the parent company. As of December 31, 2020, under FDIC and State of West Virginia regulations, Wesbanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, dividends of approximately $306.3 million from the Bank. Management believes these are appropriate levels of cash for Wesbanco given the current environment. Management continuously monitors the adequacy of parent company cash levels and sources of liquidity through the use of metrics that relate current cash levels to historical and forecasted cash inflows and outflows.\nWesbanco had outstanding commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a historical basis, only a small portion of these commitments will result in an outflow of funds. Please refer to Note 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Loans and Loan Commitments\u201d section of this MD&A for additional information.\nFederal financial regulatory agencies previously have issued guidance to provide for sound practices for managing funding and liquidity risk and strengthening liquidity risk management practices. Wesbanco maintains a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling liquidity risk, which is fully integrated into its risk management process. Management believes Wesbanco has sufficient current liquidity to meet current obligations to borrowers, depositors and others as of December 31, 2020 and that Wesbanco's current liquidity risk management policies and procedures adequately address this guidance.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Wesbanco.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. This section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Wesbanco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-looking statements in this report relating to Wesbanco's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with Wesbanco's Form 10-Qs for the prior quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020, respectively, and documents subsequently filed by Wesbanco which are available at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov or at Wesbanco's website, www.wesbanco.com. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements, which are not historical fact, involve risks and uncertainties, including those detailed under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such statements are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements, including, without limitation, the effects of changing regional and national economic conditions including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and associated interest rate sensitivity; sources of liquidity available to Wesbanco and its related subsidiary operations; potential future credit losses and the credit risk of commercial, real estate, and consumer loan customers and their borrowing activities; actions of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the SIPC, and other regulatory bodies; potential legislative and federal and state regulatory actions and reform, including, without limitation, the impact of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act; adverse decisions of federal and state courts; fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; cyber security breaches; competitive conditions in the financial services industry; rapidly changing technology affecting financial services; marketability of debt instruments and corresponding impact on fair value adjustments; and/or other external developments materially impacting Wesbanco's operational and financial performance. Wesbanco does not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWesbanco's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by Wesbanco are included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and this MD&A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management has identified the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and business combinations to be the accounting estimates that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Credit Losses- In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\u201d which require entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model, also referred to as the current expected credit loss model ( CECL\u201d) on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses in a manner similarly to current procedures, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. Entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information they use to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\u201d and in May 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Targeted Transition Relief. Public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Wesbanco was effective January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' adoption of the CECL methodology. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase-in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an optional extension of the regulatory capital transition, which allows for a two-year delay and then a three-year transition period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each\nquarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, (collectively, the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment\u201d). Wesbanco has elected to defer the impact of CECL on its regulatory capital for two years and then will phase-in the impact of the adoption of this standard on the regulatory capital calculations over the subsequent three-year period.\nUnder CECL, acquired loans or pools of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration are deemed to be purchased credit-deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans, and are grossed-up on day 1 by the initial credit estimate through the allowance as opposed to a reduction in the loan's amortized cost. The credit mark on acquired loans deemed not to be PCD loans are reflected as a reduction in the loan's amortized cost, with an allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses recorded in the first reporting period after acquisition through current period earnings, while the loan mark will accrete through interest income over the life of such loans. At acquisition, Wesbanco will consider several factors as indicators that an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loans 30 days or more past due, loans with an internal risk grade of below average or lower, loans classified as non-accrual by the acquired institution, materiality of the credit and loans that have been previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d). Upon adoption of this standard, acquired loans from prior acquisitions that met the guidelines under ASC 310-30 (formerly known as purchased credit-impaired\u201d) were reclassified as PCD loans. The accretable portion of the loan mark as of adoption date continues to accrete into interest income. However, the non-accretable portion of the loan mark was added to the allowance upon adoption, and any reversals of such mark will flow through the allowance in future periods. The loan mark on ASC 310-20 loans ( non-purchased credit-impaired\u201d) from prior acquisitions continues to accrete through interest income over the life of such loans.\nThe day 1 impact on the allowance for credit losses was $41.4 million, which included a $6.7 million adjustment for PCD loans and a $3.0 million adjustment related to loan commitments. The after-tax effect on retained earnings was $26.6 million as of January 1, 2020. The day 1 CECL calculation was derived from the selected assumption of a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast, which was obtained from a third-party vendor. After the forecast period, Wesbanco reverts back over a one-year period to historical loss rates adjusting for prepayments and curtailments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of loans. The most sensitive assumptions include the length of the forecast and reversion periods, forecast of unemployment and interest rate spreads and prepayment speeds. See Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d for further detail.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected credit losses at the initial origination date. Similarly, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities, represents expected losses on unfunded commitments. Fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses specific to loans, the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities are recognized in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of operations. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.\nThe allowance for credit loss calculation specific to loans is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, which is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, deferred loan fees (costs) and acquired premium (discount) minus any write-downs. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, because the Company has a robust policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when the loan is placed on non-accrual, and also made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income. However, Wesbanco is reserving, as part of the allowance for credit losses, for accrued interest on loan modifications under the CARES Act due to the nature and timing of these deferrals.\nThe allowance for credit loss specific to loans reflects the risk of loss in the loan portfolio. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes the probability of default ( PD\u201d) / loss given default ( LGD\u201d) approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rate spreads. Management relies on macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable sources, which may include the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) forecast and other third party forecasts from well recognized, leading economists. These forecasts can range from one to two years, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management's judgement of what can be reasonably supported. The model reversion period may range from one to three years.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans is calculated over the loan's contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the internal review date. For all other revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. The contractual term does not include any expected extensions, renewals or modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation as of the reporting period that Wesbanco will execute a troubled debt restructuring, TDR, with the borrower. Management assumes a loan will become a TDR if a loan has matured, has a principal balance, and has previously been partially charged-off. This assumption extends the maturity of these loans to six months beyond their respective maturity dates.\nContractual terms are adjusted for estimated prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. Wesbanco models term loans with an annualized prepayment\u201d rate. When Wesbanco has a specific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.\nThe evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, volume of activity, changes in lending staff, type of collateral and the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the actual historical loss rates to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio. Due to the current economic environment caused by the pandemic, management has included COVID-19 pandemic factors related to the transient credit risk not covered by the traditional allowance process, adjusted to Wesbanco's regional footprint, deferred interest on modified loans, and hospitality industry concentration.\nCommercial loans, including commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) and C&I, are individually-evaluated if they have unique characteristics, reported as TDRs, or reported as non-accrual loans and greater than $1 million in balance. Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d allows financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 7, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised),\u201d which further discusses loan modifications related to COVID-19. Wesbanco has extended loan principal and/or interest payments up to 180 days for customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These customers must meet certain criteria, such as being in good standing and not more than 30 days past due either as of December 31, 2019, or as of the implementation of the modification program under the Interagency Statement, as well as other requirements noted in the regulatory agencies' revised statement. Based on the CARES Act provision and the guidance noted above, Wesbanco does not classify the COVID-19 loan modifications as TDRs, nor are the customers considered late with regard to their delayed payments to the extent they meet the criteria. Upon exiting the loan modification deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency will resume where it was determined upon entry into the program.\nOn August 3, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations Related to COVID-19\u201d. This statement provides financial institutions with considerations for certain customers nearing the end of their COVID-19 loan deferral period noted above. As per this guidance and in accordance with the CARES Act noted above, Wesbanco developed a plan to assist certain customers with additional deferrals of principal and/or interest. This plan, mostly relating to existing commercial loans in the hospitality sector, may provide certain relief to these portfolio loans if they meet certain criteria regarding the borrower, underlying property and potential guarantors / co-borrowers. If a loan meets the criteria, it would be eligible to have twelve months of interest payments deferred or three months of principal and interest payments plus nine months of interest only payments. There are predetermined financial triggers reviewed throughout the deferred period to determine if a borrower should return to a normal amortization schedule prior to the completion of the twelve months.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted, which reauthorizes lending under the PPP loan program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021, and among other things, modifies provisions related to making PPP loans and forgiveness of PPP loans, and authorizes second draw PPP loans for borrowers that previously received a PPP loan.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets- Wesbanco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles was $1,096.8 million and $66.3 million, respectively, which represents approximately 39.8% and 2.4% of total shareholders' equity, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Wesbanco's Community Banking segment had two reporting units with goodwill.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of core deposit and customer list intangibles (long-term customer-relationship intangible assets) are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods over their weighted-average estimated useful lives, ranging from ten to sixteen years in total, and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Non-compete agreements are recognized in other assets on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective agreements, ranging from one to four years.\nWesbanco evaluates goodwill for impairment by determining if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of its reporting units. Wesbanco uses market capitalization, multiples of tangible book value, a discounted cash flow model, and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. In particular, the discounted cash flow model includes various assumptions regarding an investor's required rate of return on Wesbanco common stock, future loan loss provisions, future market spreads and net interest margins, along with various growth and economic recovery and stabilization assumptions of the economy as a whole. The resulting fair values of each method are then weighted based on the relevance and reliability of each respective method in light of the current economic environment to arrive at a weighted average fair value. The evaluation also considered macroeconomic conditions such as the general economic outlook, regional and national unemployment rates, and recent trends in equity and credit markets. Additionally, industry and market considerations, such as\nmarket-dependent multiples and metrics relative to peers, were evaluated. Wesbanco also considered recent trends in credit quality, overall financial performance, stock price appreciation, internal forecasts and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. Since adopting Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d, the impairment charge is based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.\nWesbanco completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2020 utilizing a quantitative assessment and concluded that goodwill at the reporting units was not impaired as of November 30, 2020.Additionally, Wesbanco determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 as there were no significant changes in market conditions, consolidated operating results, or forecasted future results from November 30, 2020. Due to the pandemic's effect on the economy in 2020, Wesbanco completed interim valuations of goodwill impairment at each quarter end, one of which was assisted by a third party valuation firm. None of the quarterly valuations during 2020 indicated goodwill impairment.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Wesbanco does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of $64.5 million in core deposit intangibles held at the community banking segment and $1.8 million in trust customer relationship intangibles held at the trust and investment services segment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no indicators of impairment related to intangible assets with finite useful lives.\nBusiness Combinations- Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgements. Core deposits intangibles are calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative funds and net maintenance costs.\nLoans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value with no carryover of related allowance for credit losses. Any allowance for loan loss on these pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (meaning the present value of all cash flows expected at acquisition that ultimately are not to be received). Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOn November 22, 2019, Wesbanco consummated the merger with Old Line Bancshares, Inc. ( OLBK\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Bowie, MD with approximately $3.0 billion in assets, excluding goodwill.\nNet income available to common shareholders decreased $39.5 million or 24.8% to $119.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Net income available to common shareholders excluding after-tax restructuring and merger-related expenses (non-GAAP measure) decreased $44.7 million or 26.0% to $127.1 million. These decreases reflected the impact of the 2020 adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and the impact of the current economic environment on the provision for credit losses. Net interest income improved $79.6 million or 19.9%, primarily through a 28.3% increase in average earning assets from the OLBK acquisition, partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 3.37%. The net interest margin decreased specifically due to the lower interest rate environment from the five decreases in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate, totaling 225 basis points, from July 2019 through March 2020, which was partially offset by lower funding costs. Non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a $14.5 million or 176.6% increase in mortgage banking income due to a record volume of mortgage loans sold in 2020 at higher average gain on sale margins. Non-interest expense increased $42.6 million or 13.7%, reflecting the increase in costs from the larger asset base following the OLBK acquisition.\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $0.7 billion or 4.5% compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to PPP loans. Portfolio loans of $10.8 billion increased 5.1% over the last twelve months, reflecting Wesbanco's participation in the PPP program, which resulted in $726.3 million in remaining PPP loans in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, both non-performing loans and non-performing assets as percentages of the loan portfolio and total assets were lower than at December 31, 2019, and have remained relatively consistent throughout 2020. Criticized and classified loan balances increased to 4.59% of total portfolio loans, as compared to 2.17% at December 31, 2019 due in part to the third and fourth quarter net downgrades of $209.9 million of hospitality loans as a result of reduced occupancy and debt service coverage from the current pandemic-driven environment. As a result of a combination of the pandemic and the implementation of the CECL accounting standard, the provision for credit losses increased to $107.7 million for the year as compared to $11.2 million in 2019. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans for the full year period were six basis points compared to nine basis points in 2019. Pandemic-related loan deferrals, under the CARES Act, have declined from $2.2 billion earlier in 2020 to $171.1 million, or 1.6% of total loans, as of December 31, with approximately $150 million of this total related to the hospitality industry.\nOn August 4, 2020, Wesbanco completed a capital raise totaling $150.0 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock evidenced in the form of depositary shares. This stock pays quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 6.75% and becomes callable on November 15, 2025. The capital raise essentially replaced the movement of Wesbanco's trust preferred securities from Tier 1 to Tier 2 risk-based capital at the end of 2019, as required for banks with total assets greater than $15 billion, which occurred following the OLBK acquisition. Wesbanco continues to maintain what we believe are strong regulatory capital ratios, which were enhanced by the capital raise, as both consolidated and bank-level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable well-capitalized\u201d standards promulgated by bank regulators and the BASEL III capital standards. At December 31, 2020, Tier I leverage was 10.51%, Tier I risk-based capital was 14.72%, total risk-based capital was 17.58%, and the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ( CET 1\u201d) was 13.40%. Tangible equity to tangible assets increased to 10.52% at period-end from 10.02% as of December 31, 2019, as the preferred stock issuance and increases in other comprehensive income and retained earnings benefitted this ratio.\nStrong earnings and improved total capital enabled Wesbanco to increase the quarterly dividend rate 3.2% to $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2020, the thirteenth increase over the last ten years, cumulatively representing a 129% increase over that period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net income available to common shareholders was $119.4 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, compared to $158.9 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, for 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 24.8% compared to 2019, while per share earnings decreased 37.5%.\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net interest income increased $79.6 million, or 19.9%, due to an increase in earning assets from the OLBK acquisition. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.37% due to the overall lower rate environment. Average loan balances increased 36.1% in 2020, mostly due to the OLBK acquisition and PPP loans as compared to 2019, as organic loan growth was mitigated from elevated levels of commercial real estate loans being refinanced in an aggressive secondary market. Total average deposits increased in 2020 by $2.8 billion or 31.5% compared to 2019, due to CARES Act stimulus deposits, PPP loans deposited in business accounts, increased personal savings and the OLBK acquisition. Certificates of deposit, which have the highest overall interest cost among deposits, increased by $371.9 million or 25.8% over the same time period due primarily to the OLBK acquisition.\nFor 2020, non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% compared to 2019. Mortgage banking income increased $14.5 million or 176.6% from 2019 to 2020 due to a record number of mortgage loan originations and mortgage loans sold to the secondary market during 2020. Other non-interest income increased by $7.4 million or 51.4% from 2019 to 2020 due primarily to a $2.7 million increase in business loan swap fee income. Somewhat offsetting these increases, service charges on deposits decreased $5.0 million or 18.7%, due to stimulus deposits and lower consumer spending resulting in fewer eligible fees. Electronic banking fees decreased $5.1 million or 22.6% due to the ongoing limitation on interchange fees resulting from the Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became effective for Wesbanco on July 1, 2019. The limitation only applies to banks with greater than $10 billion in total assets.\nThe following comments on non-interest expense exclude restructuring and merger-related expenses in both years. Non-interest expense in 2020 increased $49.3 million or 16.7% compared to 2019. With net revenue growth of 17.6% in 2020, the efficiency ratio decreased in 2020 to 56.4% from 56.7% in 2019. Salaries and wages increased $20.7 million or 15.6% compared to 2019, due to increased compensation expense from an increase in average full-time equivalent employees related to the OLBK acquisition. Employee benefits expense increased $2.4 million or 6.1% compared to 2019, specifically due to the increase in employees and a $1.1 million increase in health care costs. Net occupancy increased $5.1 million in 2020 or 22.6% compared to 2019, principally due to increased building-related costs including utilities, lease expense, depreciation, repairs and other seasonal maintenance costs, mostly from the acquired OLBK branches, as", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis represents an overview of the results of operations and financial condition of Wesbanco. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. This section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Wesbanco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-looking statements in this report relating to Wesbanco's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with Wesbanco's Form 10-Qs for the prior quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020, respectively, and documents subsequently filed by Wesbanco which are available at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov or at Wesbanco's website, www.wesbanco.com. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements, which are not historical fact, involve risks and uncertainties, including those detailed under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such statements are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements, including, without limitation, the effects of changing regional and national economic conditions including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and associated interest rate sensitivity; sources of liquidity available to Wesbanco and its related subsidiary operations; potential future credit losses and the credit risk of commercial, real estate, and consumer loan customers and their borrowing activities; actions of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the SIPC, and other regulatory bodies; potential legislative and federal and state regulatory actions and reform, including, without limitation, the impact of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act; adverse decisions of federal and state courts; fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; cyber security breaches; competitive conditions in the financial services industry; rapidly changing technology affecting financial services; marketability of debt instruments and corresponding impact on fair value adjustments; and/or other external developments materially impacting Wesbanco's operational and financial performance. Wesbanco does not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWesbanco's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by Wesbanco are included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and this MD&A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management has identified the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and business combinations to be the accounting estimates that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Credit Losses- In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\u201d which require entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model, also referred to as the current expected credit loss model ( CECL\u201d) on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses in a manner similarly to current procedures, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. Entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information they use to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\u201d and in May 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Targeted Transition Relief. Public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Wesbanco was effective January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' adoption of the CECL methodology. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase-in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an optional extension of the regulatory capital transition, which allows for a two-year delay and then a three-year transition period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each\nquarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, (collectively, the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment\u201d). Wesbanco has elected to defer the impact of CECL on its regulatory capital for two years and then will phase-in the impact of the adoption of this standard on the regulatory capital calculations over the subsequent three-year period.\nUnder CECL, acquired loans or pools of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration are deemed to be purchased credit-deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans, and are grossed-up on day 1 by the initial credit estimate through the allowance as opposed to a reduction in the loan's amortized cost. The credit mark on acquired loans deemed not to be PCD loans are reflected as a reduction in the loan's amortized cost, with an allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses recorded in the first reporting period after acquisition through current period earnings, while the loan mark will accrete through interest income over the life of such loans. At acquisition, Wesbanco will consider several factors as indicators that an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loans 30 days or more past due, loans with an internal risk grade of below average or lower, loans classified as non-accrual by the acquired institution, materiality of the credit and loans that have been previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d). Upon adoption of this standard, acquired loans from prior acquisitions that met the guidelines under ASC 310-30 (formerly known as purchased credit-impaired\u201d) were reclassified as PCD loans. The accretable portion of the loan mark as of adoption date continues to accrete into interest income. However, the non-accretable portion of the loan mark was added to the allowance upon adoption, and any reversals of such mark will flow through the allowance in future periods. The loan mark on ASC 310-20 loans ( non-purchased credit-impaired\u201d) from prior acquisitions continues to accrete through interest income over the life of such loans.\nThe day 1 impact on the allowance for credit losses was $41.4 million, which included a $6.7 million adjustment for PCD loans and a $3.0 million adjustment related to loan commitments. The after-tax effect on retained earnings was $26.6 million as of January 1, 2020. The day 1 CECL calculation was derived from the selected assumption of a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast, which was obtained from a third-party vendor. After the forecast period, Wesbanco reverts back over a one-year period to historical loss rates adjusting for prepayments and curtailments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of loans. The most sensitive assumptions include the length of the forecast and reversion periods, forecast of unemployment and interest rate spreads and prepayment speeds. See Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d for further detail.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, representing the lifetime expected credit losses at the initial origination date. Similarly, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities, represents expected losses on unfunded commitments. Fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses specific to loans, the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities are recognized in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of operations. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast. The allowance is increased by a provision charged to operating expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance at least quarterly. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period.\nThe allowance for credit loss calculation specific to loans is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, which is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, deferred loan fees (costs) and acquired premium (discount) minus any write-downs. Wesbanco made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, because the Company has a robust policy in place to reverse or write-off accrued interest when the loan is placed on non-accrual, and also made an accounting policy election to reverse accrued interest deemed uncollectible as a reversal of interest income. However, Wesbanco is reserving, as part of the allowance for credit losses, for accrued interest on loan modifications under the CARES Act due to the nature and timing of these deferrals.\nThe allowance for credit loss specific to loans reflects the risk of loss in the loan portfolio. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics. The Company utilizes the probability of default ( PD\u201d) / loss given default ( LGD\u201d) approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rate spreads. Management relies on macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable sources, which may include the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) forecast and other third party forecasts from well recognized, leading economists. These forecasts can range from one to two years, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management's judgement of what can be reasonably supported. The model reversion period may range from one to three years.\nThe allowance for credit losses specific to loans is calculated over the loan's contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the internal review date. For all other revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. The contractual term does not include any expected extensions, renewals or modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation as of the reporting period that Wesbanco will execute a troubled debt restructuring, TDR, with the borrower. Management assumes a loan will become a TDR if a loan has matured, has a principal balance, and has previously been partially charged-off. This assumption extends the maturity of these loans to six months beyond their respective maturity dates.\nContractual terms are adjusted for estimated prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. Wesbanco models term loans with an annualized prepayment\u201d rate. When Wesbanco has a specific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.\nThe evaluation also considers qualitative factors such as economic trends and conditions, which includes levels of regional unemployment, real estate values and the impact on specific industries and geographical markets, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, delinquency and other credit quality trends, concentrations of credit risk, if any, volume of activity, changes in lending staff, type of collateral and the results of internal loan reviews and examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Management relies on observable data from internal and external sources to the extent it is available to evaluate each of these factors and adjusts the actual historical loss rates to reflect the impact these factors may have on probable losses in the portfolio. Due to the current economic environment caused by the pandemic, management has included COVID-19 pandemic factors related to the transient credit risk not covered by the traditional allowance process, adjusted to Wesbanco's regional footprint, deferred interest on modified loans, and hospitality industry concentration.\nCommercial loans, including commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) and C&I, are individually-evaluated if they have unique characteristics, reported as TDRs, or reported as non-accrual loans and greater than $1 million in balance. Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d allows financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 7, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised),\u201d which further discusses loan modifications related to COVID-19. Wesbanco has extended loan principal and/or interest payments up to 180 days for customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These customers must meet certain criteria, such as being in good standing and not more than 30 days past due either as of December 31, 2019, or as of the implementation of the modification program under the Interagency Statement, as well as other requirements noted in the regulatory agencies' revised statement. Based on the CARES Act provision and the guidance noted above, Wesbanco does not classify the COVID-19 loan modifications as TDRs, nor are the customers considered late with regard to their delayed payments to the extent they meet the criteria. Upon exiting the loan modification deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency will resume where it was determined upon entry into the program.\nOn August 3, 2020, the joint federal regulatory agencies issued a statement, Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations Related to COVID-19\u201d. This statement provides financial institutions with considerations for certain customers nearing the end of their COVID-19 loan deferral period noted above. As per this guidance and in accordance with the CARES Act noted above, Wesbanco developed a plan to assist certain customers with additional deferrals of principal and/or interest. This plan, mostly relating to existing commercial loans in the hospitality sector, may provide certain relief to these portfolio loans if they meet certain criteria regarding the borrower, underlying property and potential guarantors / co-borrowers. If a loan meets the criteria, it would be eligible to have twelve months of interest payments deferred or three months of principal and interest payments plus nine months of interest only payments. There are predetermined financial triggers reviewed throughout the deferred period to determine if a borrower should return to a normal amortization schedule prior to the completion of the twelve months.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted, which reauthorizes lending under the PPP loan program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021, and among other things, modifies provisions related to making PPP loans and forgiveness of PPP loans, and authorizes second draw PPP loans for borrowers that previously received a PPP loan.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets- Wesbanco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest of an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles was $1,096.8 million and $66.3 million, respectively, which represents approximately 39.8% and 2.4% of total shareholders' equity, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Wesbanco's Community Banking segment had two reporting units with goodwill.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of core deposit and customer list intangibles (long-term customer-relationship intangible assets) are amortized using straight-line and accelerated methods over their weighted-average estimated useful lives, ranging from ten to sixteen years in total, and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Non-compete agreements are recognized in other assets on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective agreements, ranging from one to four years.\nWesbanco evaluates goodwill for impairment by determining if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of its reporting units. Wesbanco uses market capitalization, multiples of tangible book value, a discounted cash flow model, and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. In particular, the discounted cash flow model includes various assumptions regarding an investor's required rate of return on Wesbanco common stock, future loan loss provisions, future market spreads and net interest margins, along with various growth and economic recovery and stabilization assumptions of the economy as a whole. The resulting fair values of each method are then weighted based on the relevance and reliability of each respective method in light of the current economic environment to arrive at a weighted average fair value. The evaluation also considered macroeconomic conditions such as the general economic outlook, regional and national unemployment rates, and recent trends in equity and credit markets. Additionally, industry and market considerations, such as\nmarket-dependent multiples and metrics relative to peers, were evaluated. Wesbanco also considered recent trends in credit quality, overall financial performance, stock price appreciation, internal forecasts and various other market-based methods to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units. Since adopting Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d, the impairment charge is based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.\nWesbanco completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2020 utilizing a quantitative assessment and concluded that goodwill at the reporting units was not impaired as of November 30, 2020.Additionally, Wesbanco determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 as there were no significant changes in market conditions, consolidated operating results, or forecasted future results from November 30, 2020. Due to the pandemic's effect on the economy in 2020, Wesbanco completed interim valuations of goodwill impairment at each quarter end, one of which was assisted by a third party valuation firm. None of the quarterly valuations during 2020 indicated goodwill impairment.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Wesbanco does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of $64.5 million in core deposit intangibles held at the community banking segment and $1.8 million in trust customer relationship intangibles held at the trust and investment services segment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no indicators of impairment related to intangible assets with finite useful lives.\nBusiness Combinations- Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgements. Core deposits intangibles are calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative funds and net maintenance costs.\nLoans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value with no carryover of related allowance for credit losses. Any allowance for loan loss on these pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (meaning the present value of all cash flows expected at acquisition that ultimately are not to be received). Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOn November 22, 2019, Wesbanco consummated the merger with Old Line Bancshares, Inc. ( OLBK\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Bowie, MD with approximately $3.0 billion in assets, excluding goodwill.\nNet income available to common shareholders decreased $39.5 million or 24.8% to $119.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Net income available to common shareholders excluding after-tax restructuring and merger-related expenses (non-GAAP measure) decreased $44.7 million or 26.0% to $127.1 million. These decreases reflected the impact of the 2020 adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and the impact of the current economic environment on the provision for credit losses. Net interest income improved $79.6 million or 19.9%, primarily through a 28.3% increase in average earning assets from the OLBK acquisition, partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 3.37%. The net interest margin decreased specifically due to the lower interest rate environment from the five decreases in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate, totaling 225 basis points, from July 2019 through March 2020, which was partially offset by lower funding costs. Non-interest income increased $11.5 million or 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a $14.5 million or 176.6% increase in mortgage banking income due to a record volume of mortgage loans sold in 2020 at higher average gain on sale margins. Non-interest expense increased $42.6 million or 13.7%, reflecting the increase in costs from the larger asset base following the OLBK acquisition.\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $0.7 billion or 4.5% compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to PPP loans. Portfolio loans of $10.8 billion increased 5.1% over the last twelve months, reflecting Wesbanco's participation in the PPP program, which resulted in $726.3 million in remaining PPP loans in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, both non-performing loans and non-performing assets as percentages of the loan portfolio and total assets were lower than at December 31, 2019, and have remained relatively consistent throughout 2020. Criticized and classified loan balances increased to 4.59% of total portfolio loans, as compared to 2.17% at December 31, 2019 due in part to the third and fourth quarter net downgrades of $209.9 million of hospitality loans as a result of reduced occupancy and debt service coverage from the current pandemic-driven environment. As a result of a combination of the pandemic and the implementation of the CECL accounting standard, the provision for credit losses increased to $107.7 million for the year as compared to $11.2 million in 2019. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans for the full year period were six basis points compared to nine basis points in 2019. Pandemic-related loan deferrals, under the CARES Act, have declined from $2.2 billion earlier in 2020 to $171.1 million, or 1.6% of total loans, as of December 31, with approximately $150 million of this total related to the hospitality industry.\nOn August 4, 2020, Wesbanco completed a capital raise totaling $150.0 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock evidenced in the form of depositary shares. This stock pays quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 6.75% and becomes callable on November 15, 2025. The capital raise essentially replaced the movement of Wesbanco's trust preferred securities from Tier 1 to Tier 2 risk-based capital at the end of 2019, as required for banks with total assets greater than $15 billion, which occurred following the OLBK acquisition. Wesbanco continues to maintain what we believe are strong regulatory capital ratios, which were enhanced by the capital raise, as both consolidated and bank-level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable well-capitalized\u201d standards promulgated by bank regulators and the BASEL III capital standards. At December 31, 2020, Tier I leverage was 10.51%, Tier I risk-based capital was 14.72%, total risk-based capital was 17.58%, and the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ( CET 1\u201d) was 13.40%. Tangible equity to tangible assets increased to 10.52% at period-end from 10.02% as of December 31, 2019, as the preferred stock issuance and increases in other comprehensive income and retained earnings benefitted this ratio.\nStrong earnings and improved total capital enabled Wesbanco to increase the quarterly dividend rate 3.2% to $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2020, the thirteenth increase over the last ten years, cumulatively representing a 129% increase over that period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net income available to common shareholders was $119.4 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, compared to $158.9 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, for 2019. Net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 24.8% compared to 2019, while per share earnings decreased 37.5%.\nFor the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, net interest income increased $79.6 million, or 19.9%, due to an increase in earning assets from the OLBK acquisition. The net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.37% due to the overall lower rate environment. Average loan balances increased 36.1% in 2020, mostly due to the OLBK acquisition and PPP loans as compared to 2019, as organic loan growth was mitigated from elevated levels of commercial real estate loans being refinanced in an aggressive secondary market. Total average deposits increased in 2020 by $2.8 billion or 31.5% compared to 2019, due to CARES Act stimulus deposits, PPP loans deposited in business accounts, increased personal savings and the OLBK acquisition.
