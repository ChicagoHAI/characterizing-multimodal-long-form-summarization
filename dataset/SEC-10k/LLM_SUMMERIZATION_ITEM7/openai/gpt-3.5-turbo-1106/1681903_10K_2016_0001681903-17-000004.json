Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Please see Item 3A. Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nICC is a regional property and casualty insurance company incorporated in Illinois and focused exclusively on the food and beverage industry. On the effective date of the conversion, ICC became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICC Holdings, Inc. The consolidated financial statements of ICC prior to the conversion will become the consolidated financial statements of ICC Holdings, Inc. upon completion of the conversion.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had direct written premium of $51.0 million, net premiums earned of $42.6 million, and net income of $2.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had direct premiums written of $49.0 million, net premiums earned of $40.2 million, and net income of $2.2 million. At December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $122.2 million and equity of $33.6 million. At December 31, 2015 we had total assets of $123.4 million and equity of $30.2 million.\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the extended transition period provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act. We decided to comply with the effective dates for financial accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies at a later date in compliance with the requirements in Sections 107(b)(2) and (3) of the JOBS Act. Such decision is irrevocable.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\n\ufeff\nGross and net premiums written\n\ufeff\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2016, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2016 and the other half would be earned in 2017.\n\ufeff\n~ 39 ~\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\n\ufeff\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and settlement expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, equities, fixed maturity securities and real estate. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned on invested assets. Net realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income. We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by an independent third party and manager specializing in the insurance industry.\n\ufeff\nICC's expenses consist primarily of:\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses. Variable policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Fixed policy acquisition costs, referred to herein as underwriting and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately.\n\ufeff\nIncome taxes\n\ufeff\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These non-GAAP measures are combined ratio, written premiums, underwriting income, the loss and settlement expense ratio, the expense ratio, the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus and return on average equity.\n\ufeff\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written. We measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and settlement expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss) and net income (loss).\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of loss and settlement expenses incurred to premiums earned. We measure the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. An accident year loss ratio measures loss and settlment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures loss and settlement expense for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\n\ufeff\n~ 40 ~\nExpense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe underwriting expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering our insurance business.\n\ufeff\nGAAP combined ratio\n\ufeff\nOur GAAP combined ratio is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio and measures our overall underwriting profit. If the GAAP combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\n\ufeff\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\n\ufeff\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of our insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in our statements of earnings.\n\ufeff\nNet earnings (loss) and return on average equity\n\ufeff\nWe use net earnings (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net earnings (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nGeneral\n\ufeff\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\n\ufeff\nInvestments\n\ufeff\nThe Company classifies its investments in all debt and equity securities as available-for-sale.\n\ufeff\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities-Debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from net earnings but are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive earnings and policyholders' equity, net of deferred income taxes.\n\ufeff\nOther Than Temporary Impairment-Under current accounting standards, an OTTI write-down of debt securities, where fair value is below amortized cost, is triggered by circumstances where (1) an entity has the intent to sell a security, (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If an entity intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security's amortized cost and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other\n~ 41 ~\nfactors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses result in a reduction of the underlying investment's cost basis.\n\ufeff\nThe Company regularly evaluates its fixed income and equity securities using both quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments. The following are the key factors for determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe extent to which the fair value is less than cost,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe assessment of significant adverse changes to the cash flows on a fixed income investment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material obligation, the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization under which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe probability that the Company will recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income securities prior to maturity,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe ability and intent to hold fixed income securities until maturity or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor equity securities, the expectation of recovery to cost within a reasonable period of time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nQuantitative and qualitative criteria are considered during this process to varying degrees depending on the sector the analysis is being performed:\n\ufeff\nCorporates-The Company performs a qualitative evaluation of holdings that fall below the price threshold. The analysis begins with an opinion of industry and competitive position. This includes an assessment of factors that enable the profit structure of the business (e.g., reserve profile for exploration and production companies), competitive advantage (e.g., distribution system), management strategy, and an analysis of trends in return on invested capital. Analysts may also review other factors to determine whether an impairment exists including liquidity, asset value cash flow generation, and industry multiples.\n\ufeff\nMunicipals-The Company analyzes the screened impairment candidates on a quantitative and qualitative basis. This includes an assessment of the factors that may be contributing to the unrealized loss and whether the recovery value is greater or less than current market value.\n\ufeff\nStructured Securities-The stated assumptions\u201d analytic approach relies on actual 6-month average collateral performance measures (voluntary prepayment rate, gross default rate, and loss severity) sourced through third party data providers or remittance reports. The analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction using forecasted cash flows, which are then applied through the transaction structure (reflecting the priority of payments and performance triggers) to determine whether there is a loss to the security ( Loss to Tranche\u201d). For securities or sectors for which no actual loss or minimal loss has been observed (certain Prime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), for example), sector-based assumptions are applied or an alternative quantitative or qualitative analysis is performed.\n\ufeff\nProperty Held for Investment-Property held for investment purposes is initially recorded at the purchase price, which is generally fair value, and is subsequently reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line bases over the estimated useful lives of the building, which we estimate to be 39 years. Income from property held for investment is reported as net investment income\n\ufeff\nInvestment Income-Interest on fixed maturities and short-term investments is credited to earnings on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturities. Dividends on equity securities are credited to earnings on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses on disposition of investments are based on specific identification of the investments sold on the settlement date, which does not differ significantly from trade date accounting.\n\ufeff\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\ufeff\nCash consists of uninvested balances in bank accounts. Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily AAA-rated prime and government money market funds. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has not experienced losses on these instruments.\n\ufeff\n~ 42 ~\nLoss and Settlement Expense Reserves\n\ufeff\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (incurred losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss settlement expenses). Our loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, loss settlement expense reserve, which includes all defense and litigation-related expenses, whether internal or external to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported or for case reserve deficiencies or redundancies (IBNR).\n\ufeff\nWhen a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, injury severity or scope of property damage, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new data becomes available.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain an estimate of reserves for loss and settlement expenses incurred but not reported. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\n\ufeff\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our loss and settlement expense reserves bi-annually. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Our management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. We may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\n\ufeff\nReserving Methods\n\ufeff\nIn developing our loss and settlement expense reserve estimates, we relied upon five widely used and accepted loss reserving methods (described below). Based on the deemed predictive qualities of each of the applied methods, we selected estimated ultimates by year in order to determine our reserve estimates. Our estimates can be considered actuarial central estimates, which means that they represent an expected value over the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\ufeff\nLoss Development Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss and Settlement Expense)-Loss development ultimates are determined by multiplying current reported values by cumulative loss development factors. Incremental loss development factors are determined by analyzing historical development of losses and assuming that future development will mimic historical. Cumulative development factors are calculated from the selection of incremental factors.\n\ufeff\nThis method is also applied to incurred settlement expense to incurred loss ratios and paid settlement expense to paid loss ratios to estimate ultimate settlement expense.\n\ufeff\nLoss development methods are particularly appropriate when historical loss development patterns have been relatively stable and can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\ufeff\nExpected Loss Ratio Method- The expected loss ratio method applies a selected ultimate loss ratio to premium to determine ultimate losses and settlement expenses. Expected loss ratios for 2007 and prior were selected based on the results of the loss development methods discussed above, industry experience, actual loss experience of ICC to date and general industry conditions. Beginning with 2008, expected loss ratios have been calculated based on the prior expected loss ratios, rate changes and loss trend.\n\ufeff\nBornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss)-The Loss Development Methods rely heavily on data as of the most recent evaluation date, and a relatively small swing in early reported (or paid) losses may result in a large swing in the ultimate loss projections. Therefore, other methods may also be considered.\n\ufeff\nThe B-F Methods offer a blend of stability and responsiveness by estimating ultimate losses as a weighted combination of an expected loss estimate and current loss data. The weight applied to the expected loss estimate is based on the appropriate cumulative loss development factor from the Loss Development Methods. This percentage is multiplied by expected losses to determine expected future development. This estimate of future loss development is then added to losses as of the current evaluation date to project ultimate losses.\n\ufeff\n~ 43 ~\nA&OE Method-During 2012, we began to implement a new approach to reserving for unpaid Adjusting & Other Expenses (A&OE). This method is referred to as the Wendy Johnson Method\u201d where historical A&OE payments are measured against certain claim units to develop an average rate for projecting into future years. These claim units are defined as a means of measuring the overall level of claim activity in a year as follows:\n\ufeff\nUnits =\n2 x (Newly Reported Claims in Year X) +\n(Number of Claims Open at Start of Year X)\n\ufeff\nFuture A&OE costs are projected by inflating the selected average A&OE per unit rate, 1.0% annually, against future units calculated by claims runoff patterns.\n\ufeff\nRange of Estimates\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our actuarial central estimate, we have also developed a range of estimates. This range is not designed to represent minimum or maximum possible outcomes. It is developed to represent low and high ends for a reasonable range of expected outcomes given the selection of alternative, but reasonable assumptions. Actual results may fall outside of this range.\n\ufeff\nHigh and low net reserve estimates were developed by stressing our expected loss ratio and loss development factor selections. By applying a factor to increase (and decrease) these assumptions, we developed high (and low) ultimate loss and settlement expense estimates. These estimates, along with paid and incurred loss information, result in a range of reserves. The gross reserve range is based on selected percentages which produce a range which is slightly wider than the net range.\n\ufeff\nWe estimate IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and settlement expenses incurred by line of business as of the financial statement date. We then reduce the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expenses by loss and settlement expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses for individual lines of business, or individual accident years within a line of business, will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for a line of business' unique characteristics. Finally, we consider other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by line of business due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\n\ufeff\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for loss and settlement expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\n\ufeff\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid loss and settlment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable.\n\ufeff\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\n\ufeff\nThe Company defers commissions, premium taxes, and certain other costs that are incrementally or directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts. Acquisition-related costs may be deemed ineligible for deferral when they are based on contingent or performance criteria beyond the basic acquisition of the insurance contract or when efforts to obtain or renew the insurance contract are unsuccessful. All eligible costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized. The method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value. This deferral methodology applies to both gross and ceded premiums and acquisition costs.\n~ 44 ~\n\ufeff\nPremiums\n\ufeff\nPremiums are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts, net of ceded reinsurance. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written relative to the unexpired terms of coverage. Unearned premiums are calculated on a daily pro rata basis.\n\ufeff\nReinsurance\n\ufeff\nCeded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and settlement expenses are reported separately as assets instead of being netted with the related liabilities, since reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders.\n\ufeff\nQuarterly, the Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers. The Company's monitoring efforts include, but are not limited to, the review of annual summarized financial data and analysis of the credit risk associated with reinsurance balances recoverable by monitoring the A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's (S&P) ratings. In addition, the Company subjects its reinsurance recoverables to detailed recoverable tests, including an analysis based on average default by A.M. Best rating. Based upon the review and testing, the Company's policy is to charge to earnings, in the form of an allowance, an estimate of unrecoverable amounts from reinsurers. This allowance is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the amount makes a reasonable provision for reinsurance balances that the Company may be unable to recover.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Federal income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences\u201d by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\ufeff\nThe Company considers uncertainties in income taxes and recognizes those in its financial statements as required. As it relates to uncertainties in income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalty accruals, are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Also, no tax uncertainties are expected to result in significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12-month period. Penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties, should they occur, would be included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\ufeff\nAs an insurance company, the Company is subject to minimal state income tax liabilities. On a state basis, since the majority of income is from insurance operations, the Company pays premium taxes in lieu of state income tax. Premium taxes are a component of policy acquisition costs and calculated as a percentage of gross premiums written.\n\ufeff\nComprehensive Earnings\n\ufeff\nComprehensive earnings include net earnings plus unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale investment securities, net of tax. In reporting the components of comprehensive earnings on a net basis in the statement of earnings, the Company used a 34% tax rate.\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general. The operating results of the United States property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, weather, catastrophic events, regulation, general economic conditions, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\n\ufeff\nOur premium growth and underwriting results have been, and continue to be, influenced by market conditions. Pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical. During a soft market cycle, price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced commercial business. A hard market typically has a positive effect on premium growth.\n\ufeff\n~ 45 ~\nThe major components of operating revenues and net earnings (loss) are as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>42,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>40,220 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income, net of investment expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,968 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRealized investment gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>44,871 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41,823 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSummarized components of net earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnderwriting income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,417 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,864 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income, net of investment expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,968 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRealized investment gains, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>464 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>314 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>136 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarnings, before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,987 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,017 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>862 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet earnings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,810 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,155 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other comprehensive earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>624 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,024) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComprehensive earnings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,434 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,131 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nPremiums\n\ufeff\nDirect premiums written increased by $2.0 million, or 4.0%, primarily from organic growth from 2015 to 2016, while net written premium was essentially flat, growing by $1.6, or 3.8%, during the same period. Net premiums earned grew by $2.4 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increased organic growth and lower levels of premium ceded to reinsurance.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we ceded to reinsurers $7.9 million of earned premiums, compared to $7.7 million of earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. Ceded earned premiums as a percent of direct premiums written were 15.5% in 2016, and 15.7% in 2015. This favorable, slight decrease is a result of an overall softer reinsurance market pricing.\n\ufeff\nPremiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy.\n\ufeff\nOther income\n\ufeff\nSubstantially all other income is derived from policies we write and represents additional charges to policyholders for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billing or policy issuance costs. Other income grew by $66,000, or 34.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the growth in premium volume.\n\ufeff\n~ 46 ~\nUnpaid Losses and Settlement Expenses\n\ufeff\nThe following table details our unpaid losses and settlement expenses.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnpaid losses and settlement expense - beginning of the period:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>61,056 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>64,617 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Ceded\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19,158 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>25,822 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>41,898 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>38,795 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) in incurred losses and settlement expense:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>25,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24,293 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrior years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,275) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(493) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal incurred\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24,345 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,800 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeduct: Loss and settlement expense payments for claims incurred:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,649 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,466 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrior years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17,892 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,231 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal paid\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>25,541 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20,697 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet unpaid losses and settlement expense - end of the period\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40,702 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>41,898 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlus: Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,115 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19,158 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross unpaid losses and settlement expense - end of the period\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>52,817 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>61,056 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nDifferences from the initial reserve estimates emerged as changes in the ultimate loss estimates as those estimates were updated through the reserve analysis process. The recognition of the changes in initial reserve estimates occurred over time as claims were reported, initial case reserves were established, initial reserves were reviewed in light of additional information and ultimate payments were made on the collective set of claims incurred as of that evaluation date. The new information on the ultimate settlement value of claims is updated until all claims in a defined set are settled. As a small specialty insurer with a niche product portfolio, our experience will ordinarily exhibit fluctuations from period to period. While management attempts to identify and react to systematic changes in the loss environment, management must also consider the volume of experience directly available to us and interpret any particular period's indications with a realistic technical understanding of the reliability of those observations.\n\ufeff\nFor calendar year 2016, we experienced favorable development relative to prior years' reserve estimates in the casualty line of business primarily from the 2015 accident year. Liquor Liability and Workers' Compensation were the largest contributors to the favorable development, partially offset by adverse development in BOP Liability.\n\ufeff\nFor calendar year 2015, the Company experienced favorable development relative to prior years' reserve estimates in its property line of business primarily from the 2014 accident year. This was partially offset by adverse development in the casualty line of business in Liquor Liability, with approximately 89.4% of the development coming from this business.\n\ufeff\nPolicy Acquisition Costs and Expense Ratio\n\ufeff\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports, and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers. Policy acquisition costs were increased by $1.3 million, or 8.9%.\n\ufeff\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by net earned premiums. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a product line remain in Corporate and Other.\n\ufeff\nOur expense ratio increased 100 basis points from 36.2% to 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to the increased cost of our self-funded healthcare plan as well as costs related to increased use of temporary employees for projectes related to our mutual-to-stock conversion. As our earned premiums grow year-over-year on an expense structure that is less variable to premium volume, we expect this trend to continue in the near future, but at a slower pace.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n~ 47 ~\nGeneral Corporate Expenses\n\ufeff\nGeneral corporate expenses consist primarily of occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. These costs are largely fixed and, therefore, do not vary significantly with premium volume but do vary with the Company's changes in properties held for investment. Accordingly, our general corporate expenses increased by $150,000, or 47.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nInvestment Income\n\ufeff\nOur investment portfolio consisted of 86.8% and 88.0% of readily marketable, investment-grade fixed-maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of rental real estate, highly liquid exchange traded funds, and preferred stock. Net investment income is primarily comprised of interest earned and dividends paid on these securities and rental income on investment real estate, net of related investment expenses, and excludes realized gains and losses.\n\ufeff\nNet investment income increased by $635,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily from the growth of the investment portfolio. Average invested assets for 2016 were $78.7 million compared to $74.9 million for 2015, an increase of $3.8 million, or 5.1%. The increase in the portfolio was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.6 million.\n\ufeff\nFor additional information, see Item 1. Business - Investments above.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nInterest expense increased to $226,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $136,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This 66.2% increase year over year reflects the Company's financing of certain assets under financial sales-leaseback transactions in September 2015, again in March of 2016 and most recently from a debt agreement in September 2016. The Company does not anticipate expanding these borrowings over the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nIncome Tax Expense\n\ufeff\nWe reported an income tax expense of $1.2 million in 2016, as compared to an income tax expense of $862,000 in 2015. The income tax expense increase for 2016 relates to an increase in earnings before income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has not established a valuation allowance against any of the net deferred tax assets.\n\ufeff\n~ 48 ~\nFinancial Position\n\ufeff\nThe major components of our assets and liabilities are as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 144: <table> <tr>

This range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. We believe that the actuarially-determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and settlement expense estimates, however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The range was determined by line of business and accident year after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized. The actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on his knowledge and judgment. In making these judgments the actuary typically assumed, based on his experience, that the larger the reserve the less volatility and that property reserves would exhibit less volatility than casualty reserves. In addition, when selecting these low and high estimates, the actuary considered:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical industry development experience in our business line;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical company development experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of court decisions on insurance coverage issues, which can impact the ultimate cost of settling claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n~ 50 ~\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in our internal claims processing policies and procedures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ntrends and risks in claim costs, such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOur actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of our loss and settlement expense reserves, and related range of anticipated losses. Because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions. The method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by our actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years.\n\ufeff\nThe width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and settlement expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated. The ultimate frequency or severity of these claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures.\n\ufeff\nSpecifically, the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims, and therefore, the ultimate amount of loss and settlement expense paid:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe rate of increase in labor costs, medical costs, and material costs that underlie insured risks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndevelopment of risk associated with our expanding producer relationships and our growth in new states or states where we currently have small market share; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nimpact of changes in laws or regulations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable development). For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we experienced favorable development of $1.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n\ufeff\nPotential for variability in our reserves is evidenced by this development. As further illustration of reserve variability, we initially estimated unpaid loss and settlement expense net of reinsurance at the end of 2015 at $41.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, that reserve was re-estimated at $40.6 million, which is $1.3 million, or 3.1%, lower than the initial estimate.\n\ufeff\nAs discussed earlier, the estimation of our reserves is based on several actuarial methods, each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions. The judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method, or combination of methods, to use for a given accident year. The ranges presented above represent the expected variability around the actuarially determined central estimate. The total range around our actuarially determined estimate varies from (1.9)% to 11.5%. As shown in the table below, since 2011 the variance in our originally estimated accident year loss reserves has ranged from (4.0%) deficient to 12.0% redundant as of December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nRecent Variabilities of Incurred Losses and Settlement Expense, Net of Reinsurance\n\ufeff\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates which generally translate, respectively, into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments. The fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments also may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of other investments, the liquidity of the instrument, and other general market conditions.\n\ufeff\nWe monitor our investment portfolio and review securities that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary. When assessing whether the amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered, we compare the present value of the cash flows likely to be collected, based on an evaluation of all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, to the amortized cost basis of the security. The shortfall of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is referred to as the credit loss.\u201d If there is a credit loss, the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. If we identify that an other-than-temporary impairment loss has occurred, we then determine whether we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. If we determine that we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, the amount of the impairment loss related to the credit loss will be recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. If we determine that we intend to sell the security, or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses, the full amount of the other-than-temporary impairment will be recognized in earnings.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $0.2 million of OTTI losses on two securities that were impaired and subsequently sold during the last three months of 2016. During 2015 the Company did not recognize any impairment losses. Adverse investment market conditions, or poor operating results of underlying investments, could result in impairment charges in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe use quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services in our process for determining fair values of our investments. The evaluations of such pricing services represent an exit price and a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale. This pricing service provides us with one quote per instrument. For fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets, market quotations are provided. For fixed maturity securities that do not trade on a daily basis, the independent pricing service prepares estimates of fair value using a wide array of observable inputs including relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. The observable market inputs that our independent pricing service utilizes may include (listed in order of priority for use) benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, market bids/offers, and other reference data on markets, industry, and the economy. Additionally, the independent pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. The pricing service did not use broker quotes in determining fair values of our investments.\n\ufeff\nShould the independent pricing service be unable to provide a fair value estimate, we would attempt to obtain a non-binding fair value estimate from a number of broker-dealers and review this estimate in conjunction with a fair value estimate reported by an independent business news service or other sources. In instances where only one broker-dealer provides a fair value for a fixed maturity security, we use that estimate. In instances where we are able to obtain fair value estimates from more than one broker-dealer, we would review the range of estimates and would select the most appropriate value based on the facts and circumstances. Should neither the independent pricing service nor a broker-dealer provide a fair value estimate, we would develop a fair value estimate based on cash flow analyses and other valuation techniques that utilize certain unobservable inputs. Accordingly, we would classify such a security as a Level 3 investment.\n\ufeff\n~ 53 ~\nThe fair value estimates of our investments provided by the independent pricing service at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were utilized, among other resources, in reaching a conclusion as to the fair value of our investments.\n\ufeff\nManagement reviews the reasonableness of the pricing provided by the independent pricing service by employing various analytical procedures. We review all securities to identify recent downgrades, significant changes in pricing, and pricing anomalies on individual securities relative to other similar securities. This will include looking for relative consistency across securities in common sectors, durations, and credit ratings. This review will also include all fixed maturity securities rated lower than A\u201d by Moody's or S&P. If, after this review, management does not believe the pricing for any security is a reasonable estimate of fair value, then it will seek to resolve the discrepancy through discussions with the pricing service. In our review we did not identify any such discrepancies for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and no adjustments were made to the estimates provided by the pricing service. The classification within the fair value hierarchy of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, is then confirmed based on the final conclusions from the pricing review.\n\ufeff\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\ufeff\nCertain acquisition costs consisting of direct and ceded commissions, premium taxes and certain other direct underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies as the underlying policy premiums are earned. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, deferred acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,163 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,983 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnearned premium reserves\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24,778 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,948 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe method followed in computing deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value, which gives effect to the premium to be earned, related investment income, loss and settlement expenses, and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned. Future changes in estimates, the most significant of which is expected loss and settlement expenses, may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs. If the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, they would be written off.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\n\ufeff\nWe had net deferred tax assets of $0.9 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A valuation allowance is required to be established for any portion of the deferred tax asset for which we believe it is more likely than not that it will not be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset.\n\ufeff\nWe exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. Federal tax years 2013 through 2015 are open for examination. The tax return related to the year ended December 31, 2016 has not yet been filed.\n\ufeff\nOther Assets\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, other assets totaled $2.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Deferred stock offering and conversion expenses account for $1.3 million of the increase.\n~ 54 ~\nOutstanding Debt\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, outstanding debt balances totaled $3.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively. On August 31, 2016, surplus notes, with an initial par value of $250,000 and remaining outstanding principal of $71,000 as of such date, matured. We incurred interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $226,000 and $136,000, respectively. The average interest rate on debt in was 5.0% in 2016 compared to 4.8% in 2015.

Of this amount, an amount equal to 10% of the shares of common stock issued in the offering may be used to make restricted stock and stock-settled restricted stock unit awards and 4% of the shares of common stock issued in the offering may be used to award stock options under the stock-based incentive plan. The grant-date fair value of any common stock used for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will represent unearned compensation. As we accrue compensation expense to reflect the vesting of such shares, unearned compensation will be reduced accordingly. We will also compute compensation expense at the time stock options are awarded based on the fair value of such options on the date they are granted. This compensation expense will be recognized over the appropriate service period. Implementation of the stock-based incentive plan is subject to shareholder approval.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nWe generate sufficient funds from our operations and maintain a high degree of liquidity in our investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses. The primary sources of funds are premium collections, investment earnings and maturing investments.\n\ufeff\nWe maintain investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet our obligations without forced sales of investments. We maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds.\n\ufeff\n~ 56 ~\nUpon completion of the offering, we became subject to the proxy solicitation, periodic reporting, insider trading prohibitions and other requirements of the Exchange Act and to most of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We estimate that the cost of initial compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be approximately $300,000 and that compliance with the ongoing requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will result in an increase of approximately $200,000 in our annual operating expenses.\n\ufeff\nCash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,592 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,745 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,602) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,195) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(792) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>488 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,198 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,038 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nICC Holdings, Inc's principal source of liquidity will be dividend payments and other fees received from ICC and ICC Realty, LLC. ICC is restricted by the insurance laws of Illinois as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to us. Under Illinois law, there is a maximum amount that may be paid by ICC during any twelve-month period. ICC may pay dividends to us after notice to, but without prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance in an amount not to exceed\u201d the greater of (i) 10% of the surplus as regards policyholders of ICC as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or (ii) the statutory net income of ICC for the period covered by such annual statement. Dividends in excess of this amount are considered extraordinary\u201d and are subject to the approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance.\n\ufeff\nThe amount available for payment of dividends from ICC in 2017 without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance is approximately $3.4 million based upon the insurance company's 2016 annual statement. Prior to its payment of any dividend, ICC is required to provide notice of the dividend to the Illinois Department of Insurance. This notice must be provided to the Illinois Department of Insurance 30 days prior to the payment of an extraordinary dividend and 10 days prior to the payment of an ordinary dividend. The Illinois Department of Insurance has the power to limit or prohibit dividend payments if ICC is in violation of any law or regulation. These restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity.\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2016, our future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments for continuing operations.\n\ufeff\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEstimated gross loss and settlment expense payments\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>52,817 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,863 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,704 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,130 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,120 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>79 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>44 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>35 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>52,896 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,906 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,739 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,130 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,120 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe timing of the amounts of the gross loss and settlement expense payments is an estimate based on historical experience and the expectations of future payment patterns.

The guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. The new guidance is effective beginning after December 15, 2018, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.\n~ 57 ~\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. The guidance affects the recognition of expected credit losses. Credit losses relating to available for sale securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments will be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The effect of applying the new guidance on accounting for credit losses has not yet been determined.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016 02, Leases, which will supersede the current lease requirements in ASC 840. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and related lease liability for all leases, with a limited exception for short term leases. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. Currently, leases are classified as either capital or operating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease related expenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally consistent with the current guidance. The new lease guidance will be effective for the Company's year ending December 31, 2020 and will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the earliest period presented. The effect of applying the new lease guidance on the consolidated financial statements is expected to be minimal due to current and future lease obligations being immaterial.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016 01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The guidance affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments. The amendments will be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for the accounting guidance on financial liabilities under the fair value option. The Company will make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The primary impact this guidance will have on our financial statements relates to recognizing changes in the fair value of equity securities through the statement of earnings. The impact to our statement of earnings will vary depending upon the level of volatility in the performance of the securities held in our equity portfolio and the overall market.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-09, Disclosure about Short-Duration Contracts. The guidance addresses enhanced disclosure requirements for insurers relating to short-duration insurance contract claims and the unpaid claims liability rollforward for long and short-duration contracts. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2017 and while disclosures will be increased, management does not believe adoption will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The new guidance will be effective for the Company's year ending December 31, 2019. The effect of applying this on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material impact.\n~ 58 ~", "summary": "The report provides an overview of ICC, a regional property and casualty insurance company focused on the food and beverage industry.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Please see Item 3A. Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nICC is a regional property and casualty insurance company incorporated in Illinois and focused exclusively on the food and beverage industry. On the effective date of the conversion, ICC became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICC Holdings, Inc. The consolidated financial statements of ICC prior to the conversion will become the consolidated financial statements of ICC Holdings, Inc. upon completion of the conversion.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had direct written premium of $51.0 million, net premiums earned of $42.6 million, and net income of $2.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had direct premiums written of $49.0 million, net premiums earned of $40.2 million, and net income of $2.2 million. At December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $122.2 million and equity of $33.6 million. At December 31, 2015 we had total assets of $123.4 million and equity of $30.2 million.\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the extended transition period provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act. We decided to comply with the effective dates for financial accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies at a later date in compliance with the requirements in Sections 107(b)(2) and (3) of the JOBS Act. Such decision is irrevocable.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\n\ufeff\nGross and net premiums written\n\ufeff\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2016, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2016 and the other half would be earned in 2017.\n\ufeff\n~ 39 ~\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\n\ufeff\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and settlement expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, equities, fixed maturity securities and real estate. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned on invested assets. Net realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income. We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by an independent third party and manager specializing in the insurance industry.\n\ufeff\nICC's expenses consist primarily of:\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses. Variable policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Fixed policy acquisition costs, referred to herein as underwriting and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately.\n\ufeff\nIncome taxes\n\ufeff\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These non-GAAP measures are combined ratio, written premiums, underwriting income, the loss and settlement expense ratio, the expense ratio, the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus and return on average equity.\n\ufeff\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written. We measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and settlement expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss) and net income (loss).\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of loss and settlement expenses incurred to premiums earned. We measure the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. An accident year loss ratio measures loss and settlment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures loss and settlement expense for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\n\ufeff\n~ 40 ~\nExpense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe underwriting expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering our insurance business.\n\ufeff\nGAAP combined ratio\n\ufeff\nOur GAAP combined ratio is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio and measures our overall underwriting profit. If the GAAP combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\n\ufeff\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\n\ufeff\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of our insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in our statements of earnings.\n\ufeff\nNet earnings (loss) and return on average equity\n\ufeff\nWe use net earnings (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net earnings (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nGeneral\n\ufeff\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\n\ufeff\nInvestments\n\ufeff\nThe Company classifies its investments in all debt and equity securities as available-for-sale.\n\ufeff\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities-Debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from net earnings but are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive earnings and policyholders' equity, net of deferred income taxes.\n\ufeff\nOther Than Temporary Impairment-Under current accounting standards, an OTTI write-down of debt securities, where fair value is below amortized cost, is triggered by circumstances where (1) an entity has the intent to sell a security, (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If an entity intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security's amortized cost and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other\n~ 41 ~\nfactors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses result in a reduction of the underlying investment's cost basis.\n\ufeff\nThe Company regularly evaluates its fixed income and equity securities using both quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments. The following are the key factors for determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired:\n \u00b7 The extent to which the fair value is less than cost, \n \u00b7 The assessment of significant adverse changes to the cash flows on a fixed income investment, \n \u00b7 The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material obligation, the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization under which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value, \n \u00b7 The probability that the Company will recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income securities prior to maturity, \n \u00b7 The ability and intent to hold fixed income securities until maturity or \n \u00b7 For equity securities, the expectation of recovery to cost within a reasonable period of time. \n\ufeff\nQuantitative and qualitative criteria are considered during this process to varying degrees depending on the sector the analysis is being performed:\n\ufeff\nCorporates-The Company performs a qualitative evaluation of holdings that fall below the price threshold. The analysis begins with an opinion of industry and competitive position. This includes an assessment of factors that enable the profit structure of the business (e.g., reserve profile for exploration and production companies), competitive advantage (e.g., distribution system), management strategy, and an analysis of trends in return on invested capital. Analysts may also review other factors to determine whether an impairment exists including liquidity, asset value cash flow generation, and industry multiples.\n\ufeff\nMunicipals-The Company analyzes the screened impairment candidates on a quantitative and qualitative basis. This includes an assessment of the factors that may be contributing to the unrealized loss and whether the recovery value is greater or less than current market value.\n\ufeff\nStructured Securities-The stated assumptions\u201d analytic approach relies on actual 6-month average collateral performance measures (voluntary prepayment rate, gross default rate, and loss severity) sourced through third party data providers or remittance reports. The analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction using forecasted cash flows, which are then applied through the transaction structure (reflecting the priority of payments and performance triggers) to determine whether there is a loss to the security ( Loss to Tranche\u201d). For securities or sectors for which no actual loss or minimal loss has been observed (certain Prime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), for example), sector-based assumptions are applied or an alternative quantitative or qualitative analysis is performed.\n\ufeff\nProperty Held for Investment-Property held for investment purposes is initially recorded at the purchase price, which is generally fair value, and is subsequently reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line bases over the estimated useful lives of the building, which we estimate to be 39 years. Income from property held for investment is reported as net investment income\n\ufeff\nInvestment Income-Interest on fixed maturities and short-term investments is credited to earnings on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturities. Dividends on equity securities are credited to earnings on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses on disposition of investments are based on specific identification of the investments sold on the settlement date, which does not differ significantly from trade date accounting.\n\ufeff\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\ufeff\nCash consists of uninvested balances in bank accounts. Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily AAA-rated prime and government money market funds. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has not experienced losses on these instruments.\n\ufeff\n~ 42 ~\nLoss and Settlement Expense Reserves\n\ufeff\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (incurred losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss settlement expenses). Our loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, loss settlement expense reserve, which includes all defense and litigation-related expenses, whether internal or external to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported or for case reserve deficiencies or redundancies (IBNR).\n\ufeff\nWhen a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, injury severity or scope of property damage, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new data becomes available.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain an estimate of reserves for loss and settlement expenses incurred but not reported. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\n\ufeff\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our loss and settlement expense reserves bi-annually. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Our management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. We may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\n\ufeff\nReserving Methods\n\ufeff\nIn developing our loss and settlement expense reserve estimates, we relied upon five widely used and accepted loss reserving methods (described below). Based on the deemed predictive qualities of each of the applied methods, we selected estimated ultimates by year in order to determine our reserve estimates. Our estimates can be considered actuarial central estimates, which means that they represent an expected value over the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\ufeff\nLoss Development Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss and Settlement Expense)-Loss development ultimates are determined by multiplying current reported values by cumulative loss development factors. Incremental loss development factors are determined by analyzing historical development of losses and assuming that future development will mimic historical. Cumulative development factors are calculated from the selection of incremental factors.\n\ufeff\nThis method is also applied to incurred settlement expense to incurred loss ratios and paid settlement expense to paid loss ratios to estimate ultimate settlement expense.\n\ufeff\nLoss development methods are particularly appropriate when historical loss development patterns have been relatively stable and can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\ufeff\nExpected Loss Ratio Method- The expected loss ratio method applies a selected ultimate loss ratio to premium to determine ultimate losses and settlement expenses. Expected loss ratios for 2007 and prior were selected based on the results of the loss development methods discussed above, industry experience, actual loss experience of ICC to date and general industry conditions. Beginning with 2008, expected loss ratios have been calculated based on the prior expected loss ratios, rate changes and loss trend.\n\ufeff\nBornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss)-The Loss Development Methods rely heavily on data as of the most recent evaluation date, and a relatively small swing in early reported (or paid) losses may result in a large swing in the ultimate loss projections. Therefore, other methods may also be considered.\n\ufeff\nThe B-F Methods offer a blend of stability and responsiveness by estimating ultimate losses as a weighted combination of an expected loss estimate and current loss data. The weight applied to the expected loss estimate is based on the appropriate cumulative loss development factor from the Loss Development Methods. This percentage is multiplied by expected losses to determine expected future development. This estimate of future loss development is then added to losses as of the current evaluation date to project ultimate losses.\n\ufeff\n~ 43 ~\nA&OE Method-During 2012, we began to implement a new approach to reserving for unpaid Adjusting & Other Expenses (A&OE). This method is referred to as the Wendy Johnson Method\u201d where historical A&OE payments are measured against certain claim units to develop an average rate for projecting into future years. These claim units are defined as a means of measuring the overall level of claim activity in a year as follows:\n\ufeff\nUnits =\n2 x (Newly Reported Claims in Year X) +\n(Number of Claims Open at Start of Year X)\n\ufeff\nFuture A&OE costs are projected by inflating the selected average A&OE per unit rate, 1.0% annually, against future units calculated by claims runoff patterns.\n\ufeff\nRange of Estimates\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our actuarial central estimate, we have also developed a range of estimates. This range is not designed to represent minimum or maximum possible outcomes. It is developed to represent low and high ends for a reasonable range of expected outcomes given the selection of alternative, but reasonable assumptions. Actual results may fall outside of this range.\n\ufeff\nHigh and low net reserve estimates were developed by stressing our expected loss ratio and loss development factor selections. By applying a factor to increase (and decrease) these assumptions, we developed high (and low) ultimate loss and settlement expense estimates. These estimates, along with paid and incurred loss information, result in a range of reserves. The gross reserve range is based on selected percentages which produce a range which is slightly wider than the net range.\n\ufeff\nWe estimate IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and settlement expenses incurred by line of business as of the financial statement date. We then reduce the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expenses by loss and settlement expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses for individual lines of business, or individual accident years within a line of business, will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for a line of business' unique characteristics. Finally, we consider other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by line of business due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\n\ufeff\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for loss and settlement expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\n\ufeff\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid loss and settlment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable.\n\ufeff\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\n\ufeff\nThe Company defers commissions, premium taxes, and certain other costs that are incrementally or directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts. Acquisition-related costs may be deemed ineligible for deferral when they are based on contingent or performance criteria beyond the basic acquisition of the insurance contract or when efforts to obtain or renew the insurance contract are unsuccessful. All eligible costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized. The method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value. This deferral methodology applies to both gross and ceded premiums and acquisition costs.\n~ 44 ~\n\ufeff\nPremiums\n\ufeff\nPremiums are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts, net of ceded reinsurance. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written relative to the unexpired terms of coverage. Unearned premiums are calculated on a daily pro rata basis.\n\ufeff\nReinsurance\n\ufeff\nCeded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and settlement expenses are reported separately as assets instead of being netted with the related liabilities, since reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders.\n\ufeff\nQuarterly, the Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers. The Company's monitoring efforts include, but are not limited to, the review of annual summarized financial data and analysis of the credit risk associated with reinsurance balances recoverable by monitoring the A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's (S&P) ratings. In addition, the Company subjects its reinsurance recoverables to detailed recoverable tests, including an analysis based on average default by A.M. Best rating. Based upon the review and testing, the Company's policy is to charge to earnings, in the form of an allowance, an estimate of unrecoverable amounts from reinsurers. This allowance is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the amount makes a reasonable provision for reinsurance balances that the Company may be unable to recover.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Federal income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences\u201d by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\ufeff\nThe Company considers uncertainties in income taxes and recognizes those in its financial statements as required. As it relates to uncertainties in income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalty accruals, are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Also, no tax uncertainties are expected to result in significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12-month period. Penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties, should they occur, would be included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\ufeff\nAs an insurance company, the Company is subject to minimal state income tax liabilities. On a state basis, since the majority of income is from insurance operations, the Company pays premium taxes in lieu of state income tax. Premium taxes are a component of policy acquisition costs and calculated as a percentage of gross premiums written.\n\ufeff\nComprehensive Earnings\n\ufeff\nComprehensive earnings include net earnings plus unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale investment securities, net of tax. In reporting the components of comprehensive earnings on a net basis in the statement of earnings, the Company used a 34% tax rate.\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general. The operating results of the United States property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, weather, catastrophic events, regulation, general economic conditions, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\n\ufeff\nOur premium growth and underwriting results have been, and continue to be, influenced by market conditions. Pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical. During a soft market cycle, price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced commercial business. A hard market typically has a positive effect on premium growth.\n\ufeff\n~ 45 ~\nThe major components of operating revenues and net earnings (loss) are as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Please see Item 3A. Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\n\ufeff\nOverview\n\ufeff\nICC is a regional property and casualty insurance company incorporated in Illinois and focused exclusively on the food and beverage industry. On the effective date of the conversion, ICC became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICC Holdings, Inc. The consolidated financial statements of ICC prior to the conversion will become the consolidated financial statements of ICC Holdings, Inc. upon completion of the conversion.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had direct written premium of $51.0 million, net premiums earned of $42.6 million, and net income of $2.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had direct premiums written of $49.0 million, net premiums earned of $40.2 million, and net income of $2.2 million. At December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $122.2 million and equity of $33.6 million. At December 31, 2015 we had total assets of $123.4 million and equity of $30.2 million.\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the extended transition period provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act. We decided to comply with the effective dates for financial accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies at a later date in compliance with the requirements in Sections 107(b)(2) and (3) of the JOBS Act. Such decision is irrevocable.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\n\ufeff\nGross and net premiums written\n\ufeff\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned\n\ufeff\nPremiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2016, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2016 and the other half would be earned in 2017.\n\ufeff\n~ 39 ~\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\n\ufeff\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and settlement expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, equities, fixed maturity securities and real estate. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned on invested assets. Net realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income. We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by an independent third party and manager specializing in the insurance industry.\n\ufeff\nICC's expenses consist primarily of:\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims.\n\ufeff\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses. Variable policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Fixed policy acquisition costs, referred to herein as underwriting and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately.\n\ufeff\nIncome taxes\n\ufeff\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These non-GAAP measures are combined ratio, written premiums, underwriting income, the loss and settlement expense ratio, the expense ratio, the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus and return on average equity.\n\ufeff\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written. We measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and settlement expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss) and net income (loss).\n\ufeff\nLoss and settlement expense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of loss and settlement expenses incurred to premiums earned. We measure the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. An accident year loss ratio measures loss and settlment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures loss and settlement expense for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\n\ufeff\n~ 40 ~\nExpense ratio\n\ufeff\nThe underwriting expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering our insurance business.\n\ufeff\nGAAP combined ratio\n\ufeff\nOur GAAP combined ratio is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio and measures our overall underwriting profit. If the GAAP combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\n\ufeff\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\n\ufeff\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n\ufeff\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of our insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in our statements of earnings.\n\ufeff\nNet earnings (loss) and return on average equity\n\ufeff\nWe use net earnings (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net earnings (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nGeneral\n\ufeff\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\n\ufeff\nInvestments\n\ufeff\nThe Company classifies its investments in all debt and equity securities as available-for-sale.\n\ufeff\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities-Debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from net earnings but are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive earnings and policyholders' equity, net of deferred income taxes.\n\ufeff\nOther Than Temporary Impairment-Under current accounting standards, an OTTI write-down of debt securities, where fair value is below amortized cost, is triggered by circumstances where (1) an entity has the intent to sell a security, (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If an entity intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security's amortized cost and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other\n~ 41 ~\nfactors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses result in a reduction of the underlying investment's cost basis.\n\ufeff\nThe Company regularly evaluates its fixed income and equity securities using both quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments. The following are the key factors for determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired:\n \u00b7 The extent to which the fair value is less than cost, \n \u00b7 The assessment of significant adverse changes to the cash flows on a fixed income investment, \n \u00b7 The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material obligation, the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization under which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value, \n \u00b7 The probability that the Company will recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income securities prior to maturity, \n \u00b7 The ability and intent to hold fixed income securities until maturity or \n \u00b7 For equity securities, the expectation of recovery to cost within a reasonable period of time. \n\ufeff\nQuantitative and qualitative criteria are considered during this process to varying degrees depending on the sector the analysis is being performed:\n\ufeff\nCorporates-The Company performs a qualitative evaluation of holdings that fall below the price threshold. The analysis begins with an opinion of industry and competitive position. This includes an assessment of factors that enable the profit structure of the business (e.g., reserve profile for exploration and production companies), competitive advantage (e.g., distribution system), management strategy, and an analysis of trends in return on invested capital. Analysts may also review other factors to determine whether an impairment exists including liquidity, asset value cash flow generation, and industry multiples.\n\ufeff\nMunicipals-The Company analyzes the screened impairment candidates on a quantitative and qualitative basis. This includes an assessment of the factors that may be contributing to the unrealized loss and whether the recovery value is greater or less than current market value.\n\ufeff\nStructured Securities-The stated assumptions\u201d analytic approach relies on actual 6-month average collateral performance measures (voluntary prepayment rate, gross default rate, and loss severity) sourced through third party data providers or remittance reports. The analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction using forecasted cash flows, which are then applied through the transaction structure (reflecting the priority of payments and performance triggers) to determine whether there is a loss to the security ( Loss to Tranche\u201d). For securities or sectors for which no actual loss or minimal loss has been observed (certain Prime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), for example), sector-based assumptions are applied or an alternative quantitative or qualitative analysis is performed.\n\ufeff\nProperty Held for Investment-Property held for investment purposes is initially recorded at the purchase price, which is generally fair value, and is subsequently reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line bases over the estimated useful lives of the building, which we estimate to be 39 years. Income from property held for investment is reported as net investment income\n\ufeff\nInvestment Income-Interest on fixed maturities and short-term investments is credited to earnings on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturities. Dividends on equity securities are credited to earnings on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses on disposition of investments are based on specific identification of the investments sold on the settlement date, which does not differ significantly from trade date accounting.\n\ufeff\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\ufeff\nCash consists of uninvested balances in bank accounts. Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily AAA-rated prime and government money market funds. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has not experienced losses on these instruments.\n\ufeff\n~ 42 ~\nLoss and Settlement Expense Reserves\n\ufeff\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (incurred losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss settlement expenses). Our loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, loss settlement expense reserve, which includes all defense and litigation-related expenses, whether internal or external to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported or for case reserve deficiencies or redundancies (IBNR).\n\ufeff\nWhen a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, injury severity or scope of property damage, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new data becomes available.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain an estimate of reserves for loss and settlement expenses incurred but not reported. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\n\ufeff\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our loss and settlement expense reserves bi-annually. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Our management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. We may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\n\ufeff\nReserving Methods\n\ufeff\nIn developing our loss and settlement expense reserve estimates, we relied upon five widely used and accepted loss reserving methods (described below). Based on the deemed predictive qualities of each of the applied methods, we selected estimated ultimates by year in order to determine our reserve estimates. Our estimates can be considered actuarial central estimates, which means that they represent an expected value over the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\ufeff\nLoss Development Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss and Settlement Expense)-Loss development ultimates are determined by multiplying current reported values by cumulative loss development factors. Incremental loss development factors are determined by analyzing historical development of losses and assuming that future development will mimic historical. Cumulative development factors are calculated from the selection of incremental factors.\n\ufeff\nThis method is also applied to incurred settlement expense to incurred loss ratios and paid settlement expense to paid loss ratios to estimate ultimate settlement expense.\n\ufeff\nLoss development methods are particularly appropriate when historical loss development patterns have been relatively stable and can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\ufeff\nExpected Loss Ratio Method- The expected loss ratio method applies a selected ultimate loss ratio to premium to determine ultimate losses and settlement expenses. Expected loss ratios for 2007 and prior were selected based on the results of the loss development methods discussed above, industry experience, actual loss experience of ICC to date and general industry conditions. Beginning with 2008, expected loss ratios have been calculated based on the prior expected loss ratios, rate changes and loss trend.\n\ufeff\nBornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) Methods (Paid and Incurred Loss)-The Loss Development Methods rely heavily on data as of the most recent evaluation date, and a relatively small swing in early reported (or paid) losses may result in a large swing in the ultimate loss projections. Therefore, other methods may also be considered.\n\ufeff\nThe B-F Methods offer a blend of stability and responsiveness by estimating ultimate losses as a weighted combination of an expected loss estimate and current loss data. The weight applied to the expected loss estimate is based on the appropriate cumulative loss development factor from the Loss Development Methods. This percentage is multiplied by expected losses to determine expected future development. This estimate of future loss development is then added to losses as of the current evaluation date to project ultimate losses.\n\ufeff\n~ 43 ~\nA&OE Method-During 2012, we began to implement a new approach to reserving for unpaid Adjusting & Other Expenses (A&OE). This method is referred to as the Wendy Johnson Method\u201d where historical A&OE payments are measured against certain claim units to develop an average rate for projecting into future years. These claim units are defined as a means of measuring the overall level of claim activity in a year as follows:\n\ufeff\nUnits =\n2 x (Newly Reported Claims in Year X) +\n(Number of Claims Open at Start of Year X)\n\ufeff\nFuture A&OE costs are projected by inflating the selected average A&OE per unit rate, 1.0% annually, against future units calculated by claims runoff patterns.\n\ufeff\nRange of Estimates\n\ufeff\nIn addition to our actuarial central estimate, we have also developed a range of estimates. This range is not designed to represent minimum or maximum possible outcomes. It is developed to represent low and high ends for a reasonable range of expected outcomes given the selection of alternative, but reasonable assumptions. Actual results may fall outside of this range.\n\ufeff\nHigh and low net reserve estimates were developed by stressing our expected loss ratio and loss development factor selections. By applying a factor to increase (and decrease) these assumptions, we developed high (and low) ultimate loss and settlement expense estimates. These estimates, along with paid and incurred loss information, result in a range of reserves. The gross reserve range is based on selected percentages which produce a range which is slightly wider than the net range.\n\ufeff\nWe estimate IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and settlement expenses incurred by line of business as of the financial statement date. We then reduce the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expenses by loss and settlement expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses for individual lines of business, or individual accident years within a line of business, will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for a line of business' unique characteristics. Finally, we consider other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by line of business due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\n\ufeff\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for loss and settlement expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\n\ufeff\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid loss and settlment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable.\n\ufeff\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\n\ufeff\nThe Company defers commissions, premium taxes, and certain other costs that are incrementally or directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts. Acquisition-related costs may be deemed ineligible for deferral when they are based on contingent or performance criteria beyond the basic acquisition of the insurance contract or when efforts to obtain or renew the insurance contract are unsuccessful. All eligible costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized. The method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value. This deferral methodology applies to both gross and ceded premiums and acquisition costs.\n~ 44 ~\n\ufeff\nPremiums\n\ufeff\nPremiums are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts, net of ceded reinsurance. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written relative to the unexpired terms of coverage. Unearned premiums are calculated on a daily pro rata basis.\n\ufeff\nReinsurance\n\ufeff\nCeded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and settlement expenses are reported separately as assets instead of being netted with the related liabilities, since reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders.\n\ufeff\nQuarterly, the Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers. The Company's monitoring efforts include, but are not limited to, the review of annual summarized financial data and analysis of the credit risk associated with reinsurance balances recoverable by monitoring the A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's (S&P) ratings. In addition, the Company subjects its reinsurance recoverables to detailed recoverable tests, including an analysis based on average default by A.M. Best rating. Based upon the review and testing, the Company's policy is to charge to earnings, in the form of an allowance, an estimate of unrecoverable amounts from reinsurers. This allowance is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the amount makes a reasonable provision for reinsurance balances that the Company may be unable to recover.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Federal income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences\u201d by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\ufeff\nThe Company considers uncertainties in income taxes and recognizes those in its financial statements as required. As it relates to uncertainties in income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalty accruals, are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Also, no tax uncertainties are expected to result in significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12-month period. Penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties, should they occur, would be included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\ufeff\nAs an insurance company, the Company is subject to minimal state income tax liabilities. On a state basis, since the majority of income is from insurance operations, the Company pays premium taxes in lieu of state income tax. Premium taxes are a component of policy acquisition costs and calculated as a percentage of gross premiums written.\n\ufeff\nComprehensive Earnings\n\ufeff\nComprehensive earnings include net earnings plus unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale investment securities, net of tax. In reporting the components of comprehensive earnings on a net basis in the statement of earnings, the Company used a 34% tax rate.\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general. The operating results of the United States property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, weather, catastrophic events, regulation, general economic conditions, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\n\ufeff\nOur premium growth and underwriting results have been, and continue to be, influenced by market conditions. Pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical. During a soft market cycle, price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced commercial business. A hard market typically has a positive effect on premium growth.\n\ufeff\n~ 45 ~\nThe major components of operating revenues and net earnings (loss) are as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>42,611 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>40,220 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income, net of investment expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,968 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRealized investment gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>44,871 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41,823 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSummarized components of net earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnderwriting income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,417 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,864 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment income, net of investment expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,968 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRealized investment gains, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>255 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>189 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>464 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>314 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>136 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarnings, before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,987 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,017 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>862 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet earnings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,810 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,155 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other comprehensive earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>624 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,024) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComprehensive earnings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,434"}
