Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of the amounts and percentages in this section have been rounded for convenience of presentation, but actual recorded amounts have been used in computations. Accordingly, some information may appear not to compute accurately.\nOverview\nI.D. Systems, Inc. ( IDS\u201d, and together with its subsidiaries, I.D. Systems,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) develops, markets and sells wireless machine-to-machine ( M2M\u201d) solutions for managing and securing high-value enterprise assets. These assets include industrial vehicles, such as forklifts and airport ground support equipment; rental vehicles; and transportation assets, such as dry van trailers, refrigerated trailers, railcars and containers. Our patented wireless asset management systems utilize radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, satellite or cellular communications, and sensor technology to address the needs of organizations to control, track, monitor and analyze their assets. Our solutions enable our customers to achieve tangible economic benefits by making timely, informed decisions that increase the safety, security, revenue, productivity and efficiency of their operations.\nWe have focused our business activities on three primary business solutions: (i) Industrial Truck Asset Management, (ii) Transportation Asset Management, and (iii) Connected Vehicle Solutions. Our solution for industrial truck asset management allows our customers to reduce operating risks including unsafe activity, facility equipment and goods damage, operational costs and capital expenditures and to comply with certain safety regulations by accurately and reliably measuring and controlling fleet activity. This solution also enhances security at industrial facilities and areas of critical infrastructure, such as airports, by controlling access to, and restricting the use of, vehicles and equipment. Our solution for transportation asset management allows our customers to increase revenue per asset deployed, reduce fleet size, and improve the monitoring and control of sensitive cargo. Our solutions for connected vehicles include unique Internet-of-Things ( IoT\u201d) projects similar to projects we have delivered to Avis Budget Group. These engineering programs help our customers transform their operations. For Avis Budget Group, our rental fleet management platform assists rental car companies in generating higher revenue by more accurately tracking vehicle data, such as fuel consumption and odometer readings, and improving customer service by expediting the rental and return processes. In addition, our wireless solution for car sharing\u201d enables rental car companies to establish a network of vehicles positioned strategically around cities or on corporate campuses, control vehicles remotely, manage member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and charge members for vehicle use by the hour.\nWe sell our solutions to both executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. We also utilize channel partners such as independent dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may opt for us to white label our product. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer's organization. We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments. Post-implementation, we consult with our customers to further extend and customize the benefits to the enterprise by delivering enhanced analytics capabilities.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, heavy industry, retail and wholesale distribution, transportation, aviation, aerospace and defense, homeland security and vehicle rental.\nWe have incurred net losses of approximately $10.0 million, $6.4 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, and have incurred additional net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million, working capital of $10.1 million, and an accumulated deficit of $95.4 million. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and the Company's holdings of cash, cash equivalents and investments from the sale of common stock. To date, the Company has not generated sufficient cash flow solely from operating activities to fund our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $41.0 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 16% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $36.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 18% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $41.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 23% of our revenues.\nOn July 17, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering consisting of 2,608,695 shares of common stock at a price per share of $5.75. In addition, the underwriters of the public offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 391,304 shares of common stock. Including this option exercise, the aggregate gross proceeds from the offering of a total of 2,999,999 shares of common stock, before deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $17.3 million. Net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $16.1 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Keytroller Acquisition (as defined below) and intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 31, 2017, the Company, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary Keytroller, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Keytroller\u201d), acquired substantially all of the assets of Keytroller, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Keytroller FL\u201d and such acquisition, the Keytroller Acquisition\u201d). The business we acquired in the Keytroller Acquisition develops and markets electronic products for managing forklifts and construction vehicles. The Keytroller Acquisition gives us a full suite of industrial fleet management product offerings capable of covering any sized fleet and budget and provides our industrial truck business more scale, both from a product and revenue standpoint and markets its line of forklift management devices mainly through a network of lift truck dealers, offering solutions for different fleet sizes at a wide range of price points.\nIn 2017, we improved our next generation vehicle management system on-vehicle platform and improved our product line of over-the-road asset management solutions, as described below:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we increased the performance and reliability of our fourth-generation on-vehicle device, the VAC4, which we expect to provide benefits to both the Company (primarily through lower costs, fewer product SKU's, easier installation, integration with our hosted service offering, and expanded functional capabilities) and end users (including a simpler, universal interface with multiple vehicle types, reduced installation time, reduced upgrade time, compatibility with all known driver ID cards, newer wireless networking protocols, a larger display for vehicle operators, and enhancements to the content and style of the information displayed); we also upgraded our core processor and firmware platform to simplify ongoing development, testing and upgrade, as well as improve development quality and timeliness; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we increased the performance and reliability of three new transportation asset management products, the GSM-D400, an intermodal container tracking system, the GSM-D150, an intermodal chassis tracking device, and the GSM-D300, a dry van management system with an advanced cargo sensor, which enables customers to perform full-function asset monitoring with either satellite or cellular communications; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we initiated two new product development projects for the transportation asset management product line that will enable the use of LTE cellular communication as well as the incorporation of wireless sensors; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we developed and delivered our next-generation motor-vehicle asset communicator, tailored to the needs of both on-lot and off-lot car rental - and for the connected car market in general, including LTE cellular communication, improved, hardened, secure firmware and a more secure, scalable software platform; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we improved the enterprise analysis capabilities of our Analytics platform for multi-site, multi-region customers. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are highly dependent upon sales of our system to a few customers. The loss of any of these key customers, or any material reduction in the amount of our products they purchase during a particular period, could materially and adversely affect our revenues for such period. Conversely, a material increase in the amount of our products purchased by a key customer (or customers) during a particular period could result in a significant increase in our revenues for such period, and such increased revenues may not recur in subsequent periods. Some of these key customers, as well as other customers of the Company, operate in markets that have suffered business downturns in the past few years or may so suffer in the future, particularly in light of the current global economic downturn, and any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to replace such revenue from existing or new customers, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe expect that many customers who utilize our solutions will do so as part of a large-scale deployment of these solutions across multiple or all divisions of their organizations. A customer's decision to deploy our solutions throughout its organization will involve a significant commitment of its resources. Accordingly, initial implementations may precede any decision to deploy our solutions enterprise-wide. Throughout this sales cycle, we may spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the benefits of our solutions.\nThe timing of the deployment of our solutions may vary widely and will depend on the specific deployment plan of each customer, the complexity of the customer's organization and the difficulty of such deployment. Customers with substantial or complex organizations may deploy our solutions in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis. Because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business, we cannot predict the timing or size of these sales and deployment cycles. Long sales cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to place large orders sporadically with short lead times, may cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.\nOur ability to increase our revenues and generate net income will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>increase sales of products and services to our existing customers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>convert our initial programs into larger or enterprise-wide purchases by our customers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>increase market acceptance and penetration of our products; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>develop and commercialize new products and technologies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by our management that can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider such accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by our management in these critical accounting policies are based on historical experience and other factors that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of these judgments and assumptions, actual results could differ significantly from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from: (i) sales of our wireless asset management systems and spare parts; (ii) remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements; (iii) services, which includes training and technical support; and (iv) periodically, leasing arrangements.\nOur industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems consist of on-asset hardware, communication infrastructure, SaaS, and hosting infrastructure. Revenue derived from the sale of our industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems is allocated to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value or best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) of the element. VSOE of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately. BESP is determined based on the overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and entity specific factors. Revenue is recognized as each element is delivered based on the allocation of arrangement consideration to each element based upon VSOE or BESP, and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements. The Company's system is typically implemented by the customer or a third party and, as a result, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which usually is upon delivery of the system, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and contractual obligations have been satisfied. In some instances, we are also responsible for providing installation services. The installation services, which could be performed by third parties, are considered another element in a multi-element deliverable and revenue for installation services is recognized at the time the installation is provided. Training and technical support revenue are recognized at time of performance.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of transportation asset management systems and spare parts when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria include requirements that the delivery of future products or services under the arrangement is not required for the delivered items to serve their intended purpose. The Company has determined that the revenue derived from the sale of transportation asset management systems does not have stand-alone value to the customer separate from the SaaS services provided and, therefore, the arrangements constitute a single unit of accounting. Under the applicable accounting guidance, all of the Company's billings for equipment and the related cost are deferred, recorded, and classified as a current and long-term liability and a current and long-term asset, respectively. Deferred revenue and cost are recognized over the service contract life, ranging from one to five years, beginning at the time that a customer acknowledges acceptance of the equipment and service. The customer service contracts typically range from one to five years.\nThe service revenue for our transportation asset monitoring equipment relates to charges for monthly messaging usage and value-added features charges. The usage fee is a monthly fixed charge based on the expected utilization according to the rate plan chosen by the customer. Service revenue generally commences upon equipment installation and customer acceptance and is recognized over the period such services are provided.\nRevenue from remote transportation asset monitoring equipment activation fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract.\nSpare parts sales are reflected in product revenues and recognized on the date of customer receipt of the part.\nWe also enter into remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements for our wireless asset management systems. Revenue is recognized over the service periods and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred. Deferred revenue also includes prepayment of extended maintenance, hosting and support contracts.\nUnder certain customer contracts, we invoice progress billings once certain milestones are met. The milestone terms vary by customer and can include the receipt of the customer purchase order, delivery, installation and launch. As the systems are delivered, and services are performed, and all of the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied, we recognize revenue. If the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount invoiced, an unbilled receivable is recorded. If the amount invoiced is greater than the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes, deferred revenue is recorded.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFinancing Receivables\nNotes receivable relate to interest-bearing product financing arrangements that exceed one year and are recorded at face value. Interest income is recognized over the life of the note. Amounts collected on notes receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Unearned income is amortized to interest income over the life of the notes using the effective-interest method.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also derive revenue under leasing arrangements. The arrangements provide for monthly payments covering the system sale, maintenance, support and interest. These arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases. Accordingly, an asset is established for the sales-type lease receivable\u201d at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Revenue is deferred and recognized over the service contract, as described above. Maintenance revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term. Interest income is recognized monthly over the lease term using the effective-interest method.\nThe allowance for uncollectable minimum lease payments represents our best estimate of the amount of credit losses in the existing notes and sales-type lease receivable. The allowance is determined on an individual note and lease basis if it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due. We consider our customers' financial condition and historical payment patterns in determining the customers' probability of default. The impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's effective interest rate. There were no impairment losses recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. We do not accrue interest when a note or lease is considered impaired. When the ultimate collectability of the principal balance of the impaired note or lease is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired notes or leases are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes/leases until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income thereafter. Impairment losses are charged against the allowance and increases in the allowance are charged to bad debt expense. Notes and leases are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We resume accrual of interest when it is probable that we will collect the remaining principal and interest of an impaired note/lease. Notes and leases become past due based on how recently payments have been received.\nInventory\nInventory, which primarily consists of finished goods and components used in the Company's products, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.\nInventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value in the consolidated balance sheet. The determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories. Valuation reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory are estimated based on assumptions of future sales forecasts, product life cycle expectations, the impact of new product introductions, production requirements, and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes and by comparing the inventory levels to historical usage rates.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation for all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, as an operating expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,609,000, $1,658,000 and $2,437,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of operations. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings.\nBusiness Combinations\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names, patents, customer relationships and other intangible assets. We test goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests, to determine if impairment exists and if the use of indefinite lives is currently applicable.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any change in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is recorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Actual results could differ from such estimates in future periods based on the re-measurement of the fair value.\nProduct Warranties\nWe provide a one-year warranty on our products. Estimated future warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data and trends of product reliability and costs of repairing and replacing defective products.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying enacted statutory rates to net operating loss carryforwards and to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those levels:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's estimates of market participant assumptions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items related to our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revenues increased by approximately $4.1 million, or 11.2%, to $41.0 million in 2017 from $36.8 million in 2016. The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in total industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles revenue of approximately $5.7 million to $26.7 million in 2017 from $21.0 million in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in total transportation asset management revenue of approximately $1.6 million to $14.3 million in 2017 from $15.8 million in 2016.\nRevenues from products increased by approximately $2.2 million, or 10.2%, to $23.6 million in 2017 from $21.4 million in 2016. Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles product revenue increased by approximately $3.2 million to $17.5 million in 2017 from $14.3 million in 2016. The increase in industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles product revenue resulted principally from increased product sales of approximately $3.5 million in product sales from Keytroller. Transportation asset management product revenue decreased by approximately $1.0 million to $6.0 million in 2017 from $7.1 million in 2016. The decrease in transportation asset management product revenue resulted principally from decreased spare parts sales.\nRevenues from services increased by approximately $2.0 million, or 12.6%, to $17.4 million in 2017 from $15.5 million in 2016. Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles service revenue increased by approximately $2.5 million to $9.2 million in 2017 from $6.7 million in 2016, principally due to increased service revenue pursuant to a statement of work ( SOW#4\u201d) we entered into with Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC ( ABCR\u201d) in March 2017. Transportation asset management service revenue decreased by approximately $0.5 million to $8.3 million in 2017 from $8.8 million in 2016 principally due to a decrease in revenue per active units.\nThe following table sets forth our cost of revenues by product line for the periods indicated:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of products: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,541,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,622,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,495,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,831,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,036,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,453,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of services: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,950,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,228,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,542,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,350,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,492,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,578,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,528,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,031,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOST OF REVENUES. Cost of revenues increased by approximately $1.5 million, or 8.1%, to $20.0 million in 2017 from $18.5 million for the same period in 2016. Gross profit was $20.9 million in 2017 compared to $18.3 million for the same period in 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased to 51.1% in 2017 from 49.7% in 2016.\nCost of products decreased by approximately $0.6 million, or 4.2%, to $13.5 million in 2016 from $14.0 million in the same period in 2016. Gross profit for products was $10.1 million in 2017 compared to $7.3 million in 2016. The increase in gross profit was attributable to an increase of approximately $3.1 million in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit to $8.9 million in 2015 from $5.8 million in 2016. The transportation asset management gross profit decreased approximately $0.4 million to $1.2 million in 2017 from $1.6 in 2016. As a percentage of product revenues, gross profit increased to 42.9% in 2017 from 34.3% in 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of product revenue was due to an increase in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit percentage to 50.8% in 2017 from 40.3% in 2016, which was principally due to improved customer pricing. The transportation asset management product revenue gross profit percentage decreased to 19.9% in 2017 from 22.2% in 2016 principally due to an increase in warranty expense.\nCost of services increased by approximately $2.1 million, or 46.4%, to $6.6 million in 2017 from $4.5 million in 2016. Gross profit for services was $10.8 million in 2017 compared to $11.0 million in 2016. The decrease in gross profit was attributable to a decrease in the transportation asset management gross profit of approximately $0.3 million to $5.9 million in 2017 from $6.2 million in 2016, partially offset by increase of approximately $0.2 million in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit to $4.9 million in 2017 from $4.7 million in 2016. As a percentage of service revenues, gross profit decreased to 62.2% in 2017 from 70.9% in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of service revenue was principally due to a decrease in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles management gross profit percentage to 53.8% in 2017 from 70.8% in 2016 principally due to a lower gross margin on the development project portion of the SOW#4 we entered into with Avis. The transportation asset management gross profit percentage of 71.5% in 2017 remained generally consistent with the gross profit percentage of 71.0% in 2016.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) increased by approximately $0.9 million, or 4.6%, to $21.1 million in 2017 compared to $20.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was principally due to approximately $1.0 million in in SG&A expenses from Keytroller, $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and $0.4 in acquisition related fees, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in severance costs and $0.8 million decrease in foreign currency translation. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 51.4% in 2017 from 54.7% in the same period in 2016, primarily due to the increase in revenues from 2016 to 2017.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses decreased by approximately $0.6 million, or 12.6%, to $4.0 million in 2017 compared to $4.5 million in the same period in in 2016 principally due to a reallocation of internal product development resources to cost of services for the Avis SOW#4 project. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased to 9.7% in 2017 from 12.3% in the same period in 2016, primarily due to the decrease in expenses noted above and the increase in revenue from 2016 to 2017.\nINTEREST INCOME. Interest income decreased by $32,000, or 11.2%, to $253,000 in 2017 from $285,000 in the same period in 2016 principally due to a decrease in interest income from financing receivables.\nINTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense increased by $49,000, or 16.7%, to $342,000 in 2017 from $293,000 in the same period in 2016, principally due to accretion of the contingent consideration.\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT. Income tax benefit increased to $311,000 in 2017 from $-0- in 2016 due to the reversal of the valuation allowance in 2017 on the New Jersey R&D tax credits deferred tax asset sold during 2017.\nNET LOSS. Net loss was $3.9 million, or $(0.26) per basic and diluted share, for 2017 as compared to net loss of $6.4 million, or $(0.49) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2016. The decrease in the net loss was due primarily to the reasons described above.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth our revenues by product line for the periods indicated:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,201,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,299,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,330,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,531,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,366,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,372,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,685,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,881,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,771,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,253,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,456,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,784,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,822,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVENUES. Revenues decreased by approximately $5.0 million, or 11.9%, to $36.8 million in 2016 from $41.8 million in 2015.

Transportation asset management product revenue decreased by approximately $4.3 million to $7.1 million in 2016 from $11.3 million in 2015. The decrease in transportation asset management product revenue resulted principally from decreased product revenue of approximately $0.5 million to Ashley Distribution Services, Ltd. and spare parts sales of approximately $2.9 million to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc and $1.0 million to Knight Transportation Inc. Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles product revenue increased by approximately $1.1 million to $14.3 million in 2016 from $13.2 million in 2015. The increase in industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles product revenue resulted principally from increased product sales of approximately $1.4 million to Ford Motor Company and $1.1 million to the General Motors Company partially offset by decreased product sales of approximately $0.7 million to the Raymond Corporation and $0.5 million to Procter & Gamble.\nRevenues from services decreased by approximately $1.8 million, or 10.4%, to $15.5 million in 2016 from $17.3 million in 2015. Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles service revenue decreased by approximately $0.7 million to $6.7 million in 2016 from $7.4 million in 2015, principally due to decreased service revenue of approximately $0.7 million from Avis Budget, Inc. Transportation asset management service revenue decreased by approximately $1.1 million to $8.8 million in 2016 from $9.9 million in 2015 principally due to a decrease in the number of active units and the revenue per active unit from contract renewals.\nThe following table sets forth our cost of revenues by product line for the periods indicated:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of products: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,889,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,541,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,495,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,018,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,036,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of services: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,675,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,950,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation asset management </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,068,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,542,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,743,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,492,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,761,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,528,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOST OF REVENUES. Cost of revenues decreased by approximately $6.2 million, or 25.2%, to $18.5 million in 2016 from $24.8 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease is principally attributable to decreases in cost of products and services in 2016. Gross profit was $18.3 million in 2016 compared to $17.0 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased to 49.7% in 2016 from 40.8% in 2015.\nCost of products decreased by approximately $4.0 million, or 22.1%, to $14.0 million in 2016 from $18.0 million in the same period in 2015.

The transportation asset management gross profit decreased approximately $0.6 million to $1.6 million in 2015 from $2.2 in 2015. As a percentage of product revenues, gross profit increased to 34.3% in 2016 from 26.6% in 2015. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of product revenue was due to an increase in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit percentage to 40.3% in 2016 from 32.7% in 2015, which was principally due to improved customer pricing. The transportation asset management product revenue gross profit percentage increased to 22.2% in 2016 from 19.4% in 2015 principally from a decrease in spare parts sales which have a lower gross margin.\nCost of services decreased by approximately $2.3 million, or 33.4%, to $4.5 million in 2015 from $6.7 million in 2015. Gross profit for services was $11.0 million in 2016 compared to $10.5 million in 2015. The increase in gross profit was attributable to an increase of approximately $1.0 million in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit to $4.7 million in 2016 from $3.7 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the transportation asset management gross profit of approximately $0.6 million to $6.2 million in 2016 from $6.8 million in 2015. As a percentage of service revenues, gross profit increased to 70.9% in 2016 from 60.9% in 2015. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of service revenue was principally due to an increase in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit percentage to 70.8% in 2016 from 50.1% in 2015 and an increase in the transportation asset management gross profit percentage to 71.0% in 2016 from 69.0% in 2015. The increase in the industrial truck asset management and connected vehicles gross profit percentage was principally due to a decrease in installation expenses. The increase in transportation asset management gross profit percentage was principally due to a decrease in communication expenses.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $2.6 million, or 11.5%, to $20.1 million in 2016 compared to $22.8 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease was principally from the reduction in workforce and other cost-cutting measures implemented in the second half of 2015 and a $0.6 million decrease in professional fees from an unconsummated strategic initiative in 2015, partially offset by $0.4 million increase in severance costs related to the Company's executive management change in December 2016, and $0.4 million increase in foreign currency translation losses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 54.7% in 2016 from 54.4% in the same period in 2015, primarily due to the decrease in revenues from 2016 to 2015.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses of approximately $4.5 million in 2016 remained generally consistent with research and development expenses in 2015. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased to 12.3% in 2016 from 10.9% in the same period in 2015, primarily due to the decrease in revenues from 2016 to 2015.\nINTEREST INCOME. Interest income decreased by $57,000, or 16.7%, to $285,000 in 2016 from $342,000 in the same period in 2015 principally due to a decrease in interest income from financing receivables.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, Interest expense increased to approximately $293,000 in 2016 from $-0- in the same period in 2015, principally due to an increase in interest expense from the revolving credit facility.\nNET LOSS. Net loss was $6.4 million, or $(0.49) per basic and diluted share, for 2016 as compared to net loss of $10.0 million, or $(0.79) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the net loss was due primarily to the reasons described above.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our capital requirements have been funded primarily from the net proceeds from the issuance of our securities, including any issuances of our common stock upon the exercise of options. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million and working capital of $10.1 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $6.9 million and working capital of $10.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOn May 12, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) on May 18, 2017. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we may offer to the public from time to time, in one or more offerings, up to $60.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, and units, or any combination of the foregoing, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering. The specific terms of any future offering will be determined at the time of the offering and described in a prospectus supplement that will be filed with the SEC in connection with such offering.\nOn July 17, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering consisting of 2,608,695 shares of common stock at a price per share of $5.75. In addition, the underwriters of the public offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 391,304 shares of common stock. Including this option exercise, the aggregate gross proceeds from the offering of a total of 2,999,999 shares of common stock, before deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $17.3 million. Net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $16.1 million. We used approximately $7.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Keytroller Acquisition and intend to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nCapital Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash (including restricted cash), cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million and working capital of $10.1 million. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and our holdings of cash, cash equivalents from the sale of common stock. To date, we have not generated sufficient cash flow solely from operating activities, although we had positive cash flows in the current twelve-month period, to fund our operations.\nWe believe our available working capital, anticipated level of future revenues, expected cash flows from operations and net proceeds we raised from the underwritten public offering that closed on July 17, 2017 will provide sufficient funds to cover capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOur capital requirements depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the length of the sales cycle, the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base, the success, timing, and amount of investment required to bring new products to market, revenue growth or decline and potential acquisitions. Failure to generate positive cash flow from operations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.5 million for the same period in 2016.

The change from the same period in 2016 was primarily due to approximately $7.4 million used for the Keytroller Acquisition and net investment purchases of approximately $10.0 million in 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $3.5 million for the same period in 2015. The change from the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments of $5.7 million partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for fixed assets and website development costs of $1.7 million from 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for the same period in 2016. The change from the same period in 2016 was primarily due to net proceeds from a public offering of approximately $16.1 million, an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.2 million, partially offset by net repayments of $3.0 million of the revolving credit.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.9 million for the same period in 2015. The change from the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.9 million from 2015 partially offset by net borrowing of $3.0 million from the revolving credit facility.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>47 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>one year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,882,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>926,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,956,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Although we have entered into contracts for services, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.\nThe expected timing or payment of obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\nInflation\nWe believe our operations have not been and, in the foreseeable future, will not be, materially and adversely affected by inflation or changing prices.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nIn addition to focusing on our core applications, we adapt our systems to meet our customers' broader asset management needs and seek opportunities to expand our solution offerings through strategic acquisitions. For example, in 2009 we acquired Didbox Ltd., a privately held, United Kingdom-based manufacturer and marketer of vehicle operator identification systems, which provides us with a wider range of industrial vehicle management solutions and expands our base of operations in Europe.\nIn 2010, we entered into a purchase agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation and GE Asset Intelligence, LLC ( GEAI\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired GEAI's telematics business through the purchase of Asset Intelligence, LLC ( AI\u201d). AI combines web-based software technologies with satellite and cellular communications to deliver data-driven telematics solutions for supply chain asset management. These solutions help secure and optimize the performance of trailers, railcars, containers, and the freight they carry, enabling shippers and carriers to maximize security and efficiency throughout their supply chains.\nOn July 31, 2017, we completed the Keytroller Acquisition. The business we acquired in the Keytroller Acquisition develops and markets electronic products for managing forklifts and construction vehicles. The Keytroller Acquisition gives us a full suite of industrial fleet management product offerings capable of covering any sized fleet and budget and provides our industrial truck business more scale, both from a product and revenue standpoint and markets its line of forklift management devices mainly through a network of lift truck dealers, offering solutions for different fleet sizes at a wide range of price points.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>48 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting\u201d. The FASB issued the update to provide clarity and reduce the cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718. The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. This ASU will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\u201d which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The updated guidance requires a prospective adoption. The guidance is effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d. The amendment was issued to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when a set (inputs and processes that produce an output) is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. The requirement is for public business entities to apply the guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\u201d which requires the inclusion of restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which provides clarification on how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which amends the guidance on measuring credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. The amendment is intended to address the issue that the previous incurred loss\u201d methodology was restrictive for an entity's ability to record credit losses based on not yet meeting the probable\u201d threshold. The new language will require these assets to be valued at amortized cost presented at the net amount expected to be collected with a valuation provision. This update standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (Topic 718), which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this pronouncement January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial results.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The revised guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The revised guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value ( NRV\u201d),\u201d thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under the new guidance, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value,\u201d which eliminates the need to determine replacement cost and evaluate whether it is above the ceiling (NRV) or below the floor (NRV less a normal profit margin). The guidance defines NRV as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\u201d The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company adopted this pronouncement January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial results.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606). This ASU is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. In July 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the ASU effective date from annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while allowing for early adoption for fiscal periods after December 15, 2016.\nThe new revenue standard provides the option between two different methods of adoption. The full retrospective method calls for the Company to present each prior reported period shown in the financial statements under the new guidance. The modified retrospective method requires the Company to calculate the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance as of the date of adoption via adjustment to retained earnings. The Company continues to assess the impact the new revenue standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to adopt this update in its 2018 first quarter using the modified retrospective approach. As part of our ongoing evaluations, the Company does not expect the adoption of the new revenue standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as the revenue recognition of the majority of transactions under our current policy are expected to be appropriate under the guidance of the new revenue standard.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>49 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The MD&A section of the report discusses I.D.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of the amounts and percentages in this section have been rounded for convenience of presentation, but actual recorded amounts have been used in computations. Accordingly, some information may appear not to compute accurately.\nOverview\nI.D. Systems, Inc. ( IDS\u201d, and together with its subsidiaries, I.D. Systems,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) develops, markets and sells wireless machine-to-machine ( M2M\u201d) solutions for managing and securing high-value enterprise assets. These assets include industrial vehicles, such as forklifts and airport ground support equipment; rental vehicles; and transportation assets, such as dry van trailers, refrigerated trailers, railcars and containers. Our patented wireless asset management systems utilize radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, satellite or cellular communications, and sensor technology to address the needs of organizations to control, track, monitor and analyze their assets. Our solutions enable our customers to achieve tangible economic benefits by making timely, informed decisions that increase the safety, security, revenue, productivity and efficiency of their operations.\nWe have focused our business activities on three primary business solutions: (i) Industrial Truck Asset Management, (ii) Transportation Asset Management, and (iii) Connected Vehicle Solutions. Our solution for industrial truck asset management allows our customers to reduce operating risks including unsafe activity, facility equipment and goods damage, operational costs and capital expenditures and to comply with certain safety regulations by accurately and reliably measuring and controlling fleet activity. This solution also enhances security at industrial facilities and areas of critical infrastructure, such as airports, by controlling access to, and restricting the use of, vehicles and equipment. Our solution for transportation asset management allows our customers to increase revenue per asset deployed, reduce fleet size, and improve the monitoring and control of sensitive cargo. Our solutions for connected vehicles include unique Internet-of-Things ( IoT\u201d) projects similar to projects we have delivered to Avis Budget Group. These engineering programs help our customers transform their operations. For Avis Budget Group, our rental fleet management platform assists rental car companies in generating higher revenue by more accurately tracking vehicle data, such as fuel consumption and odometer readings, and improving customer service by expediting the rental and return processes. In addition, our wireless solution for car sharing\u201d enables rental car companies to establish a network of vehicles positioned strategically around cities or on corporate campuses, control vehicles remotely, manage member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and charge members for vehicle use by the hour.\nWe sell our solutions to both executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. We also utilize channel partners such as independent dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may opt for us to white label our product. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer's organization. We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments. Post-implementation, we consult with our customers to further extend and customize the benefits to the enterprise by delivering enhanced analytics capabilities.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, heavy industry, retail and wholesale distribution, transportation, aviation, aerospace and defense, homeland security and vehicle rental.\nWe have incurred net losses of approximately $10.0 million, $6.4 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, and have incurred additional net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million, working capital of $10.1 million, and an accumulated deficit of $95.4 million. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and the Company's holdings of cash, cash equivalents and investments from the sale of common stock. To date, the Company has not generated sufficient cash flow solely from operating activities to fund our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $41.0 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 16% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $36.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 18% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $41.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 23% of our revenues.\nOn July 17, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering consisting of 2,608,695 shares of common stock at a price per share of $5.75. In addition, the underwriters of the public offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 391,304 shares of common stock. Including this option exercise, the aggregate gross proceeds from the offering of a total of 2,999,999 shares of common stock, before deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $17.3 million. Net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $16.1 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Keytroller Acquisition (as defined below) and intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 31, 2017, the Company, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary Keytroller, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Keytroller\u201d), acquired substantially all of the assets of Keytroller, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Keytroller FL\u201d and such acquisition, the Keytroller Acquisition\u201d). The business we acquired in the Keytroller Acquisition develops and markets electronic products for managing forklifts and construction vehicles. The Keytroller Acquisition gives us a full suite of industrial fleet management product offerings capable of covering any sized fleet and budget and provides our industrial truck business more scale, both from a product and revenue standpoint and markets its line of forklift management devices mainly through a network of lift truck dealers, offering solutions for different fleet sizes at a wide range of price points.\nIn 2017, we improved our next generation vehicle management system on-vehicle platform and improved our product line of over-the-road asset management solutions, as described below:\n \u25cf we increased the performance and reliability of our fourth-generation on-vehicle device, the VAC4, which we expect to provide benefits to both the Company (primarily through lower costs, fewer product SKU's, easier installation, integration with our hosted service offering, and expanded functional capabilities) and end users (including a simpler, universal interface with multiple vehicle types, reduced installation time, reduced upgrade time, compatibility with all known driver ID cards, newer wireless networking protocols, a larger display for vehicle operators, and enhancements to the content and style of the information displayed); we also upgraded our core processor and firmware platform to simplify ongoing development, testing and upgrade, as well as improve development quality and timeliness; \u25cf we increased the performance and reliability of three new transportation asset management products, the GSM-D400, an intermodal container tracking system, the GSM-D150, an intermodal chassis tracking device, and the GSM-D300, a dry van management system with an advanced cargo sensor, which enables customers to perform full-function asset monitoring with either satellite or cellular communications; \u25cf we initiated two new product development projects for the transportation asset management product line that will enable the use of LTE cellular communication as well as the incorporation of wireless sensors; and \u25cf we developed and delivered our next-generation motor-vehicle asset communicator, tailored to the needs of both on-lot and off-lot car rental - and for the connected car market in general, including LTE cellular communication, improved, hardened, secure firmware and a more secure, scalable software platform; and \u25cf we improved the enterprise analysis capabilities of our Analytics platform for multi-site, multi-region customers. \n 36 \n \nWe are highly dependent upon sales of our system to a few customers. The loss of any of these key customers, or any material reduction in the amount of our products they purchase during a particular period, could materially and adversely affect our revenues for such period. Conversely, a material increase in the amount of our products purchased by a key customer (or customers) during a particular period could result in a significant increase in our revenues for such period, and such increased revenues may not recur in subsequent periods. Some of these key customers, as well as other customers of the Company, operate in markets that have suffered business downturns in the past few years or may so suffer in the future, particularly in light of the current global economic downturn, and any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to replace such revenue from existing or new customers, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe expect that many customers who utilize our solutions will do so as part of a large-scale deployment of these solutions across multiple or all divisions of their organizations. A customer's decision to deploy our solutions throughout its organization will involve a significant commitment of its resources. Accordingly, initial implementations may precede any decision to deploy our solutions enterprise-wide. Throughout this sales cycle, we may spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the benefits of our solutions.\nThe timing of the deployment of our solutions may vary widely and will depend on the specific deployment plan of each customer, the complexity of the customer's organization and the difficulty of such deployment. Customers with substantial or complex organizations may deploy our solutions in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis. Because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business, we cannot predict the timing or size of these sales and deployment cycles. Long sales cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to place large orders sporadically with short lead times, may cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.\nOur ability to increase our revenues and generate net income will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by our management that can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider such accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by our management in these critical accounting policies are based on historical experience and other factors that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of these judgments and assumptions, actual results could differ significantly from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\n 37 \n \nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from: (i) sales of our wireless asset management systems and spare parts; (ii) remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements; (iii) services, which includes training and technical support; and (iv) periodically, leasing arrangements.\nOur industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems consist of on-asset hardware, communication infrastructure, SaaS, and hosting infrastructure. Revenue derived from the sale of our industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems is allocated to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value or best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) of the element. VSOE of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately. BESP is determined based on the overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and entity specific factors. Revenue is recognized as each element is delivered based on the allocation of arrangement consideration to each element based upon VSOE or BESP, and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements. The Company's system is typically implemented by the customer or a third party and, as a result, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which usually is upon delivery of the system, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and contractual obligations have been satisfied. In some instances, we are also responsible for providing installation services. The installation services, which could be performed by third parties, are considered another element in a multi-element deliverable and revenue for installation services is recognized at the time the installation is provided. Training and technical support revenue are recognized at time of performance.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of transportation asset management systems and spare parts when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria include requirements that the delivery of future products or services under the arrangement is not required for the delivered items to serve their intended purpose. The Company has determined that the revenue derived from the sale of transportation asset management systems does not have stand-alone value to the customer separate from the SaaS services provided and, therefore, the arrangements constitute a single unit of accounting. Under the applicable accounting guidance, all of the Company's billings for equipment and the related cost are deferred, recorded, and classified as a current and long-term liability and a current and long-term asset, respectively. Deferred revenue and cost are recognized over the service contract life, ranging from one to five years, beginning at the time that a customer acknowledges acceptance of the equipment and service. The customer service contracts typically range from one to five years.\nThe service revenue for our transportation asset monitoring equipment relates to charges for monthly messaging usage and value-added features charges. The usage fee is a monthly fixed charge based on the expected utilization according to the rate plan chosen by the customer. Service revenue generally commences upon equipment installation and customer acceptance and is recognized over the period such services are provided.\nRevenue from remote transportation asset monitoring equipment activation fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract.\nSpare parts sales are reflected in product revenues and recognized on the date of customer receipt of the part.\nWe also enter into remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements for our wireless asset management systems. Revenue is recognized over the service periods and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred. Deferred revenue also includes prepayment of extended maintenance, hosting and support contracts.\nUnder certain customer contracts, we invoice progress billings once certain milestones are met. The milestone terms vary by customer and can include the receipt of the customer purchase order, delivery, installation and launch. As the systems are delivered, and services are performed, and all of the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied, we recognize revenue. If the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount invoiced, an unbilled receivable is recorded. If the amount invoiced is greater than the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes, deferred revenue is recorded.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFinancing Receivables\nNotes receivable relate to interest-bearing product financing arrangements that exceed one year and are recorded at face value. Interest income is recognized over the life of the note. Amounts collected on notes receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Unearned income is amortized to interest income over the life of the notes using the effective-interest method.\n 38 \n \nWe also derive revenue under leasing arrangements. The arrangements provide for monthly payments covering the system sale, maintenance, support and interest. These arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases. Accordingly, an asset is established for the sales-type lease receivable\u201d at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Revenue is deferred and recognized over the service contract, as described above. Maintenance revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term. Interest income is recognized monthly over the lease term using the effective-interest method.\nThe allowance for uncollectable minimum lease payments represents our best estimate of the amount of credit losses in the existing notes and sales-type lease receivable. The allowance is determined on an individual note and lease basis if it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due. We consider our customers' financial condition and historical payment patterns in determining the customers' probability of default. The impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's effective interest rate. There were no impairment losses recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. We do not accrue interest when a note or lease is considered impaired. When the ultimate collectability of the principal balance of the impaired note or lease is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired notes or leases are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes/leases until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income thereafter. Impairment losses are charged against the allowance and increases in the allowance are charged to bad debt expense. Notes and leases are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We resume accrual of interest when it is probable that we will collect the remaining principal and interest of an impaired note/lease. Notes and leases become past due based on how recently payments have been received.\nInventory\nInventory, which primarily consists of finished goods and components used in the Company's products, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.\nInventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value in the consolidated balance sheet. The determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories. Valuation reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory are estimated based on assumptions of future sales forecasts, product life cycle expectations, the impact of new product introductions, production requirements, and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes and by comparing the inventory levels to historical usage rates.\n 39 \n \nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation for all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, as an operating expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,609,000, $1,658,000 and $2,437,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of operations. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings.\nBusiness Combinations\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names, patents, customer relationships and other intangible assets. We test goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests, to determine if impairment exists and if the use of indefinite lives is currently applicable.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any change in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is recorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Actual results could differ from such estimates in future periods based on the re-measurement of the fair value.\nProduct Warranties\nWe provide a one-year warranty on our products. Estimated future warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data and trends of product reliability and costs of repairing and replacing defective products.\n 40 \n \nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying enacted statutory rates to net operating loss carryforwards and to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those levels:\n \u25cf Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \u25cf Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. \u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's estimates of market participant assumptions. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items related to our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our patented wireless asset management systems utilize radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, satellite or cellular communications, and sensor technology to address the needs of organizations to control, track, monitor and analyze their assets. Our solutions enable our customers to achieve tangible economic benefits by making timely, informed decisions that increase the safety, security, revenue, productivity and efficiency of their operations.\nWe have focused our business activities on three primary business solutions: (i) Industrial Truck Asset Management, (ii) Transportation Asset Management, and (iii) Connected Vehicle Solutions. Our solution for industrial truck asset management allows our customers to reduce operating risks including unsafe activity, facility equipment and goods damage, operational costs and capital expenditures and to comply with certain safety regulations by accurately and reliably measuring and controlling fleet activity. This solution also enhances security at industrial facilities and areas of critical infrastructure, such as airports, by controlling access to, and restricting the use of, vehicles and equipment. Our solution for transportation asset management allows our customers to increase revenue per asset deployed, reduce fleet size, and improve the monitoring and control of sensitive cargo. Our solutions for connected vehicles include unique Internet-of-Things ( IoT\u201d) projects similar to projects we have delivered to Avis Budget Group. These engineering programs help our customers transform their operations. For Avis Budget Group, our rental fleet management platform assists rental car companies in generating higher revenue by more accurately tracking vehicle data, such as fuel consumption and odometer readings, and improving customer service by expediting the rental and return processes. In addition, our wireless solution for car sharing\u201d enables rental car companies to establish a network of vehicles positioned strategically around cities or on corporate campuses, control vehicles remotely, manage member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and charge members for vehicle use by the hour.\nWe sell our solutions to both executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. We also utilize channel partners such as independent dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may opt for us to white label our product. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer's organization. We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments. Post-implementation, we consult with our customers to further extend and customize the benefits to the enterprise by delivering enhanced analytics capabilities.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, heavy industry, retail and wholesale distribution, transportation, aviation, aerospace and defense, homeland security and vehicle rental.\nWe have incurred net losses of approximately $10.0 million, $6.4 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively, and have incurred additional net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million, working capital of $10.1 million, and an accumulated deficit of $95.4 million. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities and the Company's holdings of cash, cash equivalents and investments from the sale of common stock. To date, the Company has not generated sufficient cash flow solely from operating activities to fund our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $41.0 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 16% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $36.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 18% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $41.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 23% of our revenues.\nOn July 17, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering consisting of 2,608,695 shares of common stock at a price per share of $5.75. In addition, the underwriters of the public offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 391,304 shares of common stock. Including this option exercise, the aggregate gross proceeds from the offering of a total of 2,999,999 shares of common stock, before deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $17.3 million. Net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $16.1 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the Keytroller Acquisition (as defined below) and intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 31, 2017, the Company, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary Keytroller, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Keytroller\u201d), acquired substantially all of the assets of Keytroller, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Keytroller FL\u201d and such acquisition, the Keytroller Acquisition\u201d). The business we acquired in the Keytroller Acquisition develops and markets electronic products for managing forklifts and construction vehicles. The Keytroller Acquisition gives us a full suite of industrial fleet management product offerings capable of covering any sized fleet and budget and provides our industrial truck business more scale, both from a product and revenue standpoint and markets its line of forklift management devices mainly through a network of lift truck dealers, offering solutions for different fleet sizes at a wide range of price points.\nIn 2017, we improved our next generation vehicle management system on-vehicle platform and improved our product line of over-the-road asset management solutions, as described below:\n \u25cf we increased the performance and reliability of our fourth-generation on-vehicle device, the VAC4, which we expect to provide benefits to both the Company (primarily through lower costs, fewer product SKU's, easier installation, integration with our hosted service offering, and expanded functional capabilities) and end users (including a simpler, universal interface with multiple vehicle types, reduced installation time, reduced upgrade time, compatibility with all known driver ID cards, newer wireless networking protocols, a larger display for vehicle operators, and enhancements to the content and style of the information displayed); we also upgraded our core processor and firmware platform to simplify ongoing development, testing and upgrade, as well as improve development quality and timeliness; \u25cf we increased the performance and reliability of three new transportation asset management products, the GSM-D400, an intermodal container tracking system, the GSM-D150, an intermodal chassis tracking device, and the GSM-D300, a dry van management system with an advanced cargo sensor, which enables customers to perform full-function asset monitoring with either satellite or cellular communications; \u25cf we initiated two new product development projects for the transportation asset management product line that will enable the use of LTE cellular communication as well as the incorporation of wireless sensors; and \u25cf we developed and delivered our next-generation motor-vehicle asset communicator, tailored to the needs of both on-lot and off-lot car rental - and for the connected car market in general, including LTE cellular communication, improved, hardened, secure firmware and a more secure, scalable software platform; and \u25cf we improved the enterprise analysis capabilities of our Analytics platform for multi-site, multi-region customers. \n 36 \n \nWe are highly dependent upon sales of our system to a few customers. The loss of any of these key customers, or any material reduction in the amount of our products they purchase during a particular period, could materially and adversely affect our revenues for such period. Conversely, a material increase in the amount of our products purchased by a key customer (or customers) during a particular period could result in a significant increase in our revenues for such period, and such increased revenues may not recur in subsequent periods. Some of these key customers, as well as other customers of the Company, operate in markets that have suffered business downturns in the past few years or may so suffer in the future, particularly in light of the current global economic downturn, and any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to replace such revenue from existing or new customers, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe expect that many customers who utilize our solutions will do so as part of a large-scale deployment of these solutions across multiple or all divisions of their organizations. A customer's decision to deploy our solutions throughout its organization will involve a significant commitment of its resources. Accordingly, initial implementations may precede any decision to deploy our solutions enterprise-wide. Throughout this sales cycle, we may spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the benefits of our solutions.\nThe timing of the deployment of our solutions may vary widely and will depend on the specific deployment plan of each customer, the complexity of the customer's organization and the difficulty of such deployment. Customers with substantial or complex organizations may deploy our solutions in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis. Because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business, we cannot predict the timing or size of these sales and deployment cycles. Long sales cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to place large orders sporadically with short lead times, may cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.\nOur ability to increase our revenues and generate net income will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>increase sales of products and services to our existing customers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>convert our initial programs into larger or enterprise-wide purchases by our customers; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>increase market acceptance and penetration of our products; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>develop and commercialize new products and technologies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by our management that can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider such accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by our management in these critical accounting policies are based on historical experience and other factors that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of these judgments and assumptions, actual results could differ significantly from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\n 37 \n \nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from: (i) sales of our wireless asset management systems and spare parts; (ii) remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements; (iii) services, which includes training and technical support; and (iv) periodically, leasing arrangements.\nOur industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems consist of on-asset hardware, communication infrastructure, SaaS, and hosting infrastructure. Revenue derived from the sale of our industrial truck and connected vehicle wireless asset management systems is allocated to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value or best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) of the element. VSOE of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately. BESP is determined based on the overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and entity specific factors. Revenue is recognized as each element is delivered based on the allocation of arrangement consideration to each element based upon VSOE or BESP, and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements. The Company's system is typically implemented by the customer or a third party and, as a result, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which usually is upon delivery of the system, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and contractual obligations have been satisfied. In some instances, we are also responsible for providing installation services. The installation services, which could be performed by third parties, are considered another element in a multi-element deliverable and revenue for installation services is recognized at the time the installation is provided. Training and technical support revenue are recognized at time of performance.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of transportation asset management systems and spare parts when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria include requirements that the delivery of future products or services under the arrangement is not required for the delivered items to serve their intended purpose. The Company has determined that the revenue derived from the sale of transportation asset management systems does not have stand-alone value to the customer separate from the SaaS services provided and, therefore, the arrangements constitute a single unit of accounting. Under the applicable accounting guidance, all of the Company's billings for equipment and the related cost are deferred, recorded, and classified as a current and long-term liability and a current and long-term asset, respectively. Deferred revenue and cost are recognized over the service contract life, ranging from one to five years, beginning at the time that a customer acknowledges acceptance of the equipment and service. The customer service contracts typically range from one to five years.\nThe service revenue for our transportation asset monitoring equipment relates to charges for monthly messaging usage and value-added features charges. The usage fee is a monthly fixed charge based on the expected utilization according to the rate plan chosen by the customer. Service revenue generally commences upon equipment installation and customer acceptance and is recognized over the period such services are provided.\nRevenue from remote transportation asset monitoring equipment activation fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract.\nSpare parts sales are reflected in product revenues and recognized on the date of customer receipt of the part.\nWe also enter into remotely hosted SaaS agreements and post-contract maintenance and support agreements for our wireless asset management systems. Revenue is recognized over the service periods and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred. Deferred revenue also includes prepayment of extended maintenance, hosting and support contracts.\nUnder certain customer contracts, we invoice progress billings once certain milestones are met. The milestone terms vary by customer and can include the receipt of the customer purchase order, delivery, installation and launch. As the systems are delivered, and services are performed, and all of the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied, we recognize revenue. If the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount invoiced, an unbilled receivable is recorded. If the amount invoiced is greater than the amount of revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes, deferred revenue is recorded.\nSales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFinancing Receivables\nNotes receivable relate to interest-bearing product financing arrangements that exceed one year and are recorded at face value. Interest income is recognized over the life of the note. Amounts collected on notes receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Unearned income is amortized to interest income over the life of the notes using the effective-interest method.\n 38 \n \nWe also derive revenue under leasing arrangements. The arrangements provide for monthly payments covering the system sale, maintenance, support and interest. These arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases. Accordingly, an asset is established for the sales-type lease receivable\u201d at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Revenue is deferred and recognized over the service contract, as described above. Maintenance revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term. Interest income is recognized monthly over the lease term using the effective-interest method.\nThe allowance for uncollectable minimum lease payments represents our best estimate of the amount of credit losses in the existing notes and sales-type lease receivable. The allowance is determined on an individual note and lease basis if it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due. We consider our customers' financial condition and historical payment patterns in determining the customers' probability of default. The impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's effective interest rate. There were no impairment losses recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. We do not accrue interest when a note or lease is considered impaired. When the ultimate collectability of the principal balance of the impaired note or lease is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired notes or leases are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes/leases until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income thereafter. Impairment losses are charged against the allowance and increases in the allowance are charged to bad debt expense. Notes and leases are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We resume accrual of interest when it is probable that we will collect the remaining principal and interest of an impaired note/lease. Notes and leases become past due based on how recently payments have been received.\nInventory\nInventory, which primarily consists of finished goods and components used in the Company's products, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.\nInventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value in the consolidated balance sheet. The determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories. Valuation reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory are estimated based on assumptions of future sales forecasts, product life cycle expectations, the impact of new product introductions, production requirements, and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering/material changes and by comparing the inventory levels to historical usage rates.\n 39 \n \nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation for all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, as an operating expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,609,000, $1,658,000 and $2,437,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of operations. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our historical rates of forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings.\nBusiness Combinations\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names, patents, customer relationships and other intangible assets. We test goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests, to determine if impairment exists and if the use of indefinite lives is currently applicable.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any change in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is recorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Actual results could differ from such estimates in future periods based on the re-measurement of the fair value.\nProduct Warranties\nWe provide a one-year warranty on our products. Estimated future warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data and trends of product reliability and costs of repairing and replacing defective products.\n 40 \n \nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying enacted statutory rates to net operating loss carryforwards and to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2017, we had a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those levels:\n \u25cf Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \u25cf Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. \u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's estimates of market participant assumptions. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain items related to our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our results reflect the operations of Keytroller from July 31, 2017, the effective date of the Keytroller Acquisition. A detailed discussion of the material changes in our operating results is set forth below.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Products </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of products </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (loss), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax benefit -
