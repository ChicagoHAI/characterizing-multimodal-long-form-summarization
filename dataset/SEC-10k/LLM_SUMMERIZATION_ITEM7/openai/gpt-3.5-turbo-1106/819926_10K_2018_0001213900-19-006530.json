    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nHistorically, our primary operations involved the design, manufacture and distribution of a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.\nWe design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. Historically, the Chinese government's mandate to phase out older machinery in China's textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards has benefitted us. However, in recent years, challenging economic conditions, increases in raw materials prices and the Chinese government's more aggressive stance toward shutting down factories, including textile manufacturers, that are not compliant with emission standards, have adversely impacted our dyeing and finishing businesses. Due to rising production costs, many other textile manufacturers are closing or relocating to other countries outside of China in Southeast Asia.\nIn an effort to improve our product offering and appeal to textile manufacturers outside of our current customer base in China, we have developed prototypes of next generation dyeing and finishing equipment utilizing a patent we purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018.\nWe are also diversifying our manufacturing operations to target other industries outside of the textile industry and are constructing a mobile phone cover production line. As of the date of this annual report, the line is nearly completed and we expect to begin production in the first half of 2019. We are actively exploring other new ventures and opportunities that could contribute to our business in the future. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible.\nOn December 26, 2016, Dyeing and Xue Miao, an unrelated individual, formed Shengxin, in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and the unrelated third party holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province. Shengxin paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will invest in new solar farm or provide the subsidies needed to fund projects.\nOur investment in Shengxin is subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot give any assurance that Shengxin will be able to obtain any permits, raise any required funding, develop and operate or sell any solar farms or operate profitably or that Dyeing will have the resources to provide any funds that may be required in order to fund any solar farm projects for which Shengxin may obtain permits. There may be a significant delay between the time funds are advanced for any project and the realization of revenue or cash flow from any project.\nIn September 2018, due to significance doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, we fully impaired the value of its investment in Shengxin in the amount of approximately $8,7 million (equivalent to RMB59.8 million). At December 31, 2018, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $15,000, $16.3 million and $14,000, respectively, and liabilities consisted of other payables of approximately $51,000. At December 31, 2017, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $17.3 million and $615,000 and $5,000, respectively, and had no liabilities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's share of Shengxin's net loss were $199,410 and $130,498, respectively.\nThrough December 30, 2016, we operated in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufactured and sold precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries, On December 30, 2016, we sold the stock in Fulland Wind, the subsidiary that operated our forged rolled rings and related components business, to a non-affiliated third party, as a result of which the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as a discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAdditionally, during 2016, we operated a petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufactured and sold petroleum and chemical equipment. Because of a significant decline in revenues from this segment, we determined that we would not continue to operate in this segment and accordingly, the petroleum and chemical equipment segment is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRecently, difficult economic conditions, limited availability of credit in China and trade tensions with the US presented numerous challenges for our business. As a result, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers already upgraded to newer models and we believe that much of our remaining potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, if we are to sell our products to the smaller textile manufacturers, it may be necessary for us to design and market a cheaper machine that meets the Chinese government requirements or reduce prices which would impact both revenues and gross margin.\nOur ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to the textile industry, environmental issues and alternative energy as well as the competitiveness of Chinese textile manufacturers at a time when consumers are looking for lower prices and manufacturers are looking to produce in a country that has lower labor costs than China, all of which affects the market for our dyeing and finishing equipment. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in the near future, if at all. For example, tariffs levied on Chinese textile manufacturers by the US have a negative impact on our customers and limit their ability to purchase equipment from us. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projections of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nGiven the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2018.\nRecent developments\nInspirit Studio\nDuring the period, BuddiGo, the sharing economy mobile platform developed by Inspirit Studio Limited ( Inspirit Studio\u201d), continuously promoted its service to the local market in Hong Kong. BuddiGo offers a wide range of errand services. Currently, about 80 percent of the orders [to be updated] received are for on-demand urgent delivery of items such as documents, flowers and cakes. Food delivery services are also available. During 2018, over 1,200 individuals have officially registered as sell-side buddies, who completed over 500 delivery orders in 2018, majority orders were happened in the third quarter. In addition, BuddiGo has signed up with a number of local business partners to provide ongoing delivery services for these clients. BuddiGo's goal is to connect with the community and deliver localized content featuring BuddiGo's core features and advantages. BuddiGo is actively seeking strategic investors or collaborative parties who are enthusiastic about its business model and can help achieve its business targets and expand into different countries.\nAnyWorkspace Limited\nAnyworkspace, our coworking business unit, is focused on enlarging its exposure to the general public. AnyWorkspace started showing positive traction in India as space providers from New Delhi and Gurgaon have signed partnership agreements with us. We are currently revamping AnyWorkspace's corporate website, www.anyworkspace.com. AnyWorkspace will also focus on digital marketing activities for its market expansion plans when there is available cash flow or funds from investors.\nGiven the existing coworking spaces providers marketing their available spaces and managing individual online business platform themselves, we expect our current global online platform will take years to materialize its worldwide customer base. Therefore, the intangible asset amounted to $0.6 million (equivalent to HK$4.97 million) representing the online platform acquired has been fully impaired in the last quarter of 2018.\n3D Discovery Co. Limited\n3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery's space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong's leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality (\"VR\") industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world's largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app, Autocap, which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.\n3D Discovery successfully completed a number of projects during the year. First, its 3D Virtual Tours in Hong Kong\u201d generated about 1,371,000 impressions in 2018. In addition, 3D Discovery partnered with Midland Realty, one of the largest real estate agencies in Hong Kong, to establish the Creation 200 3D Virtual Tours.\u201d This business unit generated HK$1.7 million in revenue in 2018.\nEC Advertising Limited\nFollowing the acquisition of BuddiGo, AnyWorkspace and 3D Discovery by the Company during the period between late 2017 and the first half year of 2018, EC Advertising Limited ( EC Advertising\u201d) has been developing opportunities for these three platforms to attract advertisers.\nDuring the period, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Xiamen, Fujian Province of Mainland China, which is intended to cover our advertising business in this region. We started meeting with a number of potential clients there and anticipate that this advertising company will confirm with them several marketing campaigns. In order to maximize our exposure to the potential clients in Mainland China, we are developing a strategic media plan which will cover major cities in Mainland China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Major banks, real estate developers and consumer products manufacturers and retailers are our target clients. More importantly, our presence in Mainland China can facilitate the rollout of franchise programs of our business units, which is one of the revenue drivers for the Company.\nECrent Platform Business\nAsia Region:\nIn 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a license agreement with ECRENT, regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Korea. According to the latest amendment, ECRENT will guarantee that the operation of its related websites, mobile applications and business services will contribute revenue of US$13,000,000 (increased from US$10,000,000 according to the previously amended agreement) and gross profit of US$2,522,000 (up from US$1,940,000 as stated on the previously amended agreement) from the closing date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2019 (extended from June 30, 2019 per the previously amended agreement).\nIn August, SEIL has entered into a License Agreement with PTI Corporation ( PTI\u201d), that sublicenses SEIL's exclusive license with ECRENT to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in South Korea. In return, PTI shall pay to SEIL $230,000 ( Consideration\u201d). The License Agreement will be effective on September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In addition, if the aggregate revenue during the period exceeds the Consideration, SEIL shall receive 30% of the difference between the aggregate revenue and the Consideration. During the third quarter of 2018, PTI commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform.\nEurope Region:\nIn August 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a License Agreement with ECRENT regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. In return, SEII shall issue to ECRENT 360,000 shares of restricted common stock. Closing of this transaction was conditioned on various conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. On October 9, 2018, the agreement was terminated by the parties, who have agreed to forego their respective rights under the agreement.\nGoing forward, we will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Four major suppliers provided 55% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2018. Four major suppliers provided 50% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2017. No supplier accounted for approximately 10% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2018. One supplier accounted for approximately 15% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, the fair value of equity method investment, the fair value of assets held for sale and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nDyeing is considered a VIE, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Dyeing pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of Dyeing's net income. In accordance with these agreements, Dyeing shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service Dyeing.\nThe accounts of the Dyeing are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As a VIE, Dyeing's sales are included in our total sales, its income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in Dyeing that require consolidation of the Dyeing's financial statements with our financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Useful Life </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Building and building improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 20 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufacturing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 10 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nPatent Use Rights\nIn August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We amortize the exclusive patent use right over the term of the patent.\nIntangible Assets\nIn January 2018, in connection the acquisition of 3D Discovery and AnyWorkspace, the Company acquired their technologies. The technology of 3D Discovery covers a 3D virtual tour solution for the property industry and the technology of AnyWorkspace covers management software for an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, FASB issued an update Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). ASU 2014-09, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. This standard, which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. We adopted this standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires applying the new standard to all existing contracts not yet completed as of the effective date and recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Based on an evaluation of the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our sources of revenue, we have concluded that ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the process for, timing of, and presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition from customers.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nWe recognized revenue from the rental of batteries when earned.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC, Inland Revenue Ordinance of Hong Kong and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We account for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is charged to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d), a tax reform bill which, among other items, reduces the current federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%. The rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, and is permanent.\nThe Act has caused the Company's deferred income taxes to be revalued. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense. Pursuant to the guidance within SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), as of December 31, 2017, the Company recognized the provisional effects of the enactment of the Act for which measurement could be reasonably estimated. Since the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the revaluation of the deferred tax assets did not have a material impact on any period presented. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from these estimates due to the Company's continued analysis or further regulatory guidance that may be issued as a result of the Act.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the vesting period or immediately if the award is non-forfeitable. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 permits the election of an accounting policy for forfeitures of share-based payment awards, either to recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate forfeitures over the vesting period of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur and the cumulative impact of this change did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThrough September 30, 2018, pursuant to ASC 505-50 - Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d, all share-based payments to non-employees, including grants of stock options, were recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense over the service period of the consulting arrangement or until performance conditions are expected to be met. The Company periodically reassessed the fair value of non-employee share based payments until service conditions are met, which generally aligns with the vesting period of the equity instrument, and the Company adjusts the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements accordingly. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of the stock-based compensation guidance in ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. ASU No. 2018-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, but entities may not adopt prior to adopting the new revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2018-07 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and there was no cumulative effect of adoption.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIEs is the RMB and Hong Kong Dollar. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiary. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders' equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nOur financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB and the Hong Kong dollar. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation of the RMB or HKD against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB or HKD against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The pronouncement requires a modified retrospective method of adoption and is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, or ASU 2017-11, which updates the guidance related to the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. Under ASU 2017-11, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. ASU 2017-11 is effective for public entities for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2017-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017 the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA is incomplete but for which they are able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional amount in the financial statements. Provisional treatment is proper in light of anticipated additional guidance from various taxing authorities, the SEC, the FASB, and even the Joint Committee on Taxation. If a company cannot determine a provisional amount to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the TCJA. We have applied this guidance to our financial statements.\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. This standard amends Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740) to provide guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which allows companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740 within a one-year measurement period from the Tax Act enactment date. This standard is effective upon issuance. As described in the footnotes to the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Reform Act is being assessed; however, in certain cases, as described below, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and valuation allowance. The Company determined that the $5.4 million recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, and corresponding valuation allowance was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2018.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment. ASU 2018-07 aligns the accounting for share based payments granted to non-employees with that of share based payments granted to employees. We adopted this ASU on its effective date of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements. The amendments in ASU 2018-09 affect a wide variety of Topics in the FASB Codification and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. The Company has evaluated ASU 2018-09 in its entirety and determined that the amendments related to Topic 718-740, Compensation-Stock Compensation-Income Taxes, are the only provisions that currently apply to the Company. The amendments in ASU 2018-09 related to Topic 718-740, Compensation-Stock Compensation-Income Taxes, clarify that an entity should recognize excess tax benefits related to stock compensation transactions in the period in which the amount of the deduction is determined. The amendments in ASU 2018-09 related to Topic 718-740 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10 Leases (Topic 842), Codification Improvements and ASU 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, to provide additional guidance for the adoption of Topic 842. ASU 2018-10 clarifies certain provisions and correct unintended applications of the guidance such as the application of implicit rate, lessee reassessment of lease classification, and certain transition adjustments that should be recognized to earnings rather than to stockholders' equity. ASU 2018-11 provides an alternative transition method and practical expedient for separating contract components for the adoption of Topic 842. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) which requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases with terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-10, and ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the new lease standards\u201d) are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new lease standards will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company anticipates recognizing assets and liabilities arising from any leases that meet the requirements under the new lease standards on the adoption date and including qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 removes or modifies certain disclosures and in certain instances requires additional disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on its effective date of January 1, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on its effective date of January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-17, Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entites, that changes the guidance for determining whether a decision-making fee paid to a decision makers and service providers are variable interests. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on its effective date of January 1, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which provides clarification on implementation issues associated with adopting ASU 2016-02. The implementation issues noted in ASU 2019-01 include determining the fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers, presentation on the statement of cash flows for sales-type and direct financing leases, and transition disclosures related to Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. We will apply the guidance, if applicable, as of January 1, 2019, the date we adopted ASU 2016-02. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 indicated as a percentage of revenues (dollars in thousands):\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross (loss) profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,416 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,798 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(344.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,232 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,304 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(188 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,102 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(442.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,420 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(408 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,102 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(442.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,828 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,086 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(442.6 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,926 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other comprehensive loss: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreign currency translation adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,266 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Comprehensive loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,352 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(466.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,879 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from the sale of dyeing and finishing equipment decreased by $4,164,000, or 30.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. We experienced an anticipated slowdown in sales of our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many customers had replaced older dyeing equipment with our low-emission airflow dyeing machine, and we believe that orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines have slowed down in 2018 and 2017 because the remaining potential customer base included many companies that did not have the ability to make the significant capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their equipment. Additionally, the textile industry in China has been facing significant headwinds recently. Difficult economic conditions, a continuing decline in oil prices and limited availability of credit in China, presented numerous challenges for our dyeing machine business. Additionally, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout the last year by China's environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China's environmental laws. Accordingly, our revenues decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017. We expect that our revenues from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its' current level in the near future, although declines are possible.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenues from our sharing economy business of $208,175 compared to $58,499 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues includes the cost of raw materials, labor, depreciation and other fixed and variable overhead costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of revenues was $13,924,000 as compared to $13,678,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $246,000, or 1.8%.\nGross profit (loss) and gross margin. Our gross loss was approximately $(4,416,000) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to gross profit of $(156,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing gross margins of (46.4)% and (1.2)%, respectively, a decrease year over year. The decrease in our gross margin for 2018 was primarily attributed to the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, and an increase in labor and raw material costs. We expect that our gross margin from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at its current levels although a decrease is possible as we try to market our equipment to the smaller textile manufactures.\nOperating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating expenses were $28,382,000 as compared to $12,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $16,306,000, or 135.0%, and consisted of the following:\nDepreciation. Depreciation was $4,046,000 and $3,951,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was included in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,951 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.

The increase in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to losses incurred in the 2018 periods related to our equity method investment of $8,771,000, including a write off of our equity method investment in September 2018.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax expense was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $408,000.\nLoss from continuing operations. As a result of the foregoing, our loss from continuing operations was $42,102,000, or $(7.15) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with loss from continuing operations of $12,828,000, or $(6.99) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $29,682,000, or 239.0%.\nGain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Our gain from discontinued operations was $16,000, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with loss from discontinued operations of $98,000, or $(0.05) per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $114,000 or 116.6%.\nThe summarized operating result of discontinued operations included our consolidated statements of operations is as follows:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross (loss) profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,872 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain from operations - bad debt recovery </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,957 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,957 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(97,957 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss.

The functional currency of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities operating in the PRC is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi ( RMB\u201d). The financial statements of our subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation loss of $2,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a foreign currency translation gain of $4,047,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing our reported comprehensive loss.\nComprehensive loss. As a result of our foreign currency translation loss, we had comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $44,352,000, compared to comprehensive loss of $8,879,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis.

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nHistorically, our primary operations involved the design, manufacture and distribution of a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.\nWe design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. Historically, the Chinese government's mandate to phase out older machinery in China's textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards has benefitted us. However, in recent years, challenging economic conditions, increases in raw materials prices and the Chinese government's more aggressive stance toward shutting down factories, including textile manufacturers, that are not compliant with emission standards, have adversely impacted our dyeing and finishing businesses. Due to rising production costs, many other textile manufacturers are closing or relocating to other countries outside of China in Southeast Asia.\nIn an effort to improve our product offering and appeal to textile manufacturers outside of our current customer base in China, we have developed prototypes of next generation dyeing and finishing equipment utilizing a patent we purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018.\nWe are also diversifying our manufacturing operations to target other industries outside of the textile industry and are constructing a mobile phone cover production line. As of the date of this annual report, the line is nearly completed and we expect to begin production in the first half of 2019. We are actively exploring other new ventures and opportunities that could contribute to our business in the future. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible.\nOn December 26, 2016, Dyeing and Xue Miao, an unrelated individual, formed Shengxin, in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and the unrelated third party holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province. Shengxin paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will invest in new solar farm or provide the subsidies needed to fund projects.\nOur investment in Shengxin is subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot give any assurance that Shengxin will be able to obtain any permits, raise any required funding, develop and operate or sell any solar farms or operate profitably or that Dyeing will have the resources to provide any funds that may be required in order to fund any solar farm projects for which Shengxin may obtain permits. There may be a significant delay between the time funds are advanced for any project and the realization of revenue or cash flow from any project.\nIn September 2018, due to significance doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, we fully impaired the value of its investment in Shengxin in the amount of approximately $8,7 million (equivalent to RMB59.8 million). At December 31, 2018, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $15,000, $16.3 million and $14,000, respectively, and liabilities consisted of other payables of approximately $51,000. At December 31, 2017, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $17.3 million and $615,000 and $5,000, respectively, and had no liabilities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's share of Shengxin's net loss were $199,410 and $130,498, respectively.\nThrough December 30, 2016, we operated in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufactured and sold precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries, On December 30, 2016, we sold the stock in Fulland Wind, the subsidiary that operated our forged rolled rings and related components business, to a non-affiliated third party, as a result of which the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as a discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAdditionally, during 2016, we operated a petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufactured and sold petroleum and chemical equipment. Because of a significant decline in revenues from this segment, we determined that we would not continue to operate in this segment and accordingly, the petroleum and chemical equipment segment is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRecently, difficult economic conditions, limited availability of credit in China and trade tensions with the US presented numerous challenges for our business. As a result, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers already upgraded to newer models and we believe that much of our remaining potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, if we are to sell our products to the smaller textile manufacturers, it may be necessary for us to design and market a cheaper machine that meets the Chinese government requirements or reduce prices which would impact both revenues and gross margin.\nOur ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to the textile industry, environmental issues and alternative energy as well as the competitiveness of Chinese textile manufacturers at a time when consumers are looking for lower prices and manufacturers are looking to produce in a country that has lower labor costs than China, all of which affects the market for our dyeing and finishing equipment. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in the near future, if at all. For example, tariffs levied on Chinese textile manufacturers by the US have a negative impact on our customers and limit their ability to purchase equipment from us. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projections of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nGiven the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2018.\nRecent developments\nInspirit Studio\nDuring the period, BuddiGo, the sharing economy mobile platform developed by Inspirit Studio Limited ( Inspirit Studio\u201d), continuously promoted its service to the local market in Hong Kong. BuddiGo offers a wide range of errand services. Currently, about 80 percent of the orders [to be updated] received are for on-demand urgent delivery of items such as documents, flowers and cakes. Food delivery services are also available. During 2018, over 1,200 individuals have officially registered as sell-side buddies, who completed over 500 delivery orders in 2018, majority orders were happened in the third quarter. In addition, BuddiGo has signed up with a number of local business partners to provide ongoing delivery services for these clients. BuddiGo's goal is to connect with the community and deliver localized content featuring BuddiGo's core features and advantages. BuddiGo is actively seeking strategic investors or collaborative parties who are enthusiastic about its business model and can help achieve its business targets and expand into different countries.\nAnyWorkspace Limited\nAnyworkspace, our coworking business unit, is focused on enlarging its exposure to the general public. AnyWorkspace started showing positive traction in India as space providers from New Delhi and Gurgaon have signed partnership agreements with us. We are currently revamping AnyWorkspace's corporate website, www.anyworkspace.com. AnyWorkspace will also focus on digital marketing activities for its market expansion plans when there is available cash flow or funds from investors.\nGiven the existing coworking spaces providers marketing their available spaces and managing individual online business platform themselves, we expect our current global online platform will take years to materialize its worldwide customer base. Therefore, the intangible asset amounted to $0.6 million (equivalent to HK$4.97 million) representing the online platform acquired has been fully impaired in the last quarter of 2018.\n3D Discovery Co. Limited\n3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery's space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong's leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality (\"VR\") industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world's largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app, Autocap, which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.\n3D Discovery successfully completed a number of projects during the year. First, its 3D Virtual Tours in Hong Kong\u201d generated about 1,371,000 impressions in 2018. In addition, 3D Discovery partnered with Midland Realty, one of the largest real estate agencies in Hong Kong, to establish the Creation 200 3D Virtual Tours.\u201d This business unit generated HK$1.7 million in revenue in 2018.\nEC Advertising Limited\nFollowing the acquisition of BuddiGo, AnyWorkspace and 3D Discovery by the Company during the period between late 2017 and the first half year of 2018, EC Advertising Limited ( EC Advertising\u201d) has been developing opportunities for these three platforms to attract advertisers.\nDuring the period, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Xiamen, Fujian Province of Mainland China, which is intended to cover our advertising business in this region. We started meeting with a number of potential clients there and anticipate that this advertising company will confirm with them several marketing campaigns. In order to maximize our exposure to the potential clients in Mainland China, we are developing a strategic media plan which will cover major cities in Mainland China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Major banks, real estate developers and consumer products manufacturers and retailers are our target clients. More importantly, our presence in Mainland China can facilitate the rollout of franchise programs of our business units, which is one of the revenue drivers for the Company.\nECrent Platform Business\nAsia Region:\nIn 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a license agreement with ECRENT, regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Korea. According to the latest amendment, ECRENT will guarantee that the operation of its related websites, mobile applications and business services will contribute revenue of US$13,000,000 (increased from US$10,000,000 according to the previously amended agreement) and gross profit of US$2,522,000 (up from US$1,940,000 as stated on the previously amended agreement) from the closing date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2019 (extended from June 30, 2019 per the previously amended agreement).\nIn August, SEIL has entered into a License Agreement with PTI Corporation ( PTI\u201d), that sublicenses SEIL's exclusive license with ECRENT to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in South Korea. In return, PTI shall pay to SEIL $230,000 ( Consideration\u201d). The License Agreement will be effective on September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In addition, if the aggregate revenue during the period exceeds the Consideration, SEIL shall receive 30% of the difference between the aggregate revenue and the Consideration. During the third quarter of 2018, PTI commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform.\nEurope Region:\nIn August 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a License Agreement with ECRENT regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. In return, SEII shall issue to ECRENT 360,000 shares of restricted common stock. Closing of this transaction was conditioned on various conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. On October 9, 2018, the agreement was terminated by the parties, who have agreed to forego their respective rights under the agreement.\nGoing forward, we will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Four major suppliers provided 55% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2018. Four major suppliers provided 50% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2017. No supplier accounted for approximately 10% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2018. One supplier accounted for approximately 15% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, the fair value of equity method investment, the fair value of assets held for sale and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nDyeing is considered a VIE, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Dyeing pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of Dyeing's net income. In accordance with these agreements, Dyeing shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service Dyeing.\nThe accounts of the Dyeing are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As a VIE, Dyeing's sales are included in our total sales, its income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in Dyeing that require consolidation of the Dyeing's financial statements with our financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\n\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nPatent Use Rights\nIn August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We amortize the exclusive patent use right over the term of the patent.\nIntangible Assets\nIn January 2018, in connection the acquisition of 3D Discovery and AnyWorkspace, the Company acquired their technologies. The technology of 3D Discovery covers a 3D virtual tour solution for the property industry and the technology of AnyWorkspace covers management software for an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, FASB issued an update Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). ASU 2014-09, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. This standard, which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. We adopted this standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires applying the new standard to all existing contracts not yet completed as of the effective date and recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Based on an evaluation of the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our sources of revenue, we have concluded that ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the process for, timing of, and presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition from customers.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nWe recognized revenue from the rental of batteries when earned.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC, Inland Revenue Ordinance of Hong Kong and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We account for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is charged to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d), a tax reform bill which, among other items, reduces the current federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%. The rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, and is permanent.\nThe Act has caused the Company's deferred income taxes to be revalued. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense. Pursuant to the guidance within SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), as of December 31, 2017, the Company recognized the provisional effects of the enactment of the Act for which measurement could be reasonably estimated. Since the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the revaluation of the deferred tax assets did not have a material impact on any period presented. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from these estimates due to the Company's continued analysis or further regulatory guidance that may be issued as a result of the Act.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the vesting period or immediately if the award is non-forfeitable. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 permits the election of an accounting policy for forfeitures of share-based payment awards, either to recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate forfeitures over the vesting period of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur and the cumulative impact of this change did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThrough September 30, 2018, pursuant to ASC 505-50 - Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d, all share-based payments to non-employees, including grants of stock options, were recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense over the service period of the consulting arrangement or until performance conditions are expected to be met. The Company periodically reassessed the fair value of non-employee share based payments until service conditions are met, which generally aligns with the vesting period of the equity instrument, and the Company adjusts the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements accordingly. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of the stock-based compensation guidance in ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nHistorically, our primary operations involved the design, manufacture and distribution of a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.\nWe design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. Historically, the Chinese government's mandate to phase out older machinery in China's textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards has benefitted us. However, in recent years, challenging economic conditions, increases in raw materials prices and the Chinese government's more aggressive stance toward shutting down factories, including textile manufacturers, that are not compliant with emission standards, have adversely impacted our dyeing and finishing businesses. Due to rising production costs, many other textile manufacturers are closing or relocating to other countries outside of China in Southeast Asia.\nIn an effort to improve our product offering and appeal to textile manufacturers outside of our current customer base in China, we have developed prototypes of next generation dyeing and finishing equipment utilizing a patent we purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing our customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, we have not recorded any revenues from this patent and believe it is unlikely to yield significant value to the Company. As a result, we recorded a $1.9 million impairment loss on this asset during the third quarter of 2018.\nWe are also diversifying our manufacturing operations to target other industries outside of the textile industry and are constructing a mobile phone cover production line. As of the date of this annual report, the line is nearly completed and we expect to begin production in the first half of 2019. We are actively exploring other new ventures and opportunities that could contribute to our business in the future. We expect our revenue from dyeing and finishing equipment segment will remain at or about its current quarterly level in the near future, although declines are possible.\nOn December 26, 2016, Dyeing and Xue Miao, an unrelated individual, formed Shengxin, in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and the unrelated third party holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province. Shengxin paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Chinese government will invest in new solar farm or provide the subsidies needed to fund projects.\nOur investment in Shengxin is subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot give any assurance that Shengxin will be able to obtain any permits, raise any required funding, develop and operate or sell any solar farms or operate profitably or that Dyeing will have the resources to provide any funds that may be required in order to fund any solar farm projects for which Shengxin may obtain permits. There may be a significant delay between the time funds are advanced for any project and the realization of revenue or cash flow from any project.\nIn September 2018, due to significance doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, we fully impaired the value of its investment in Shengxin in the amount of approximately $8,7 million (equivalent to RMB59.8 million). At December 31, 2018, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $15,000, $16.3 million and $14,000, respectively, and liabilities consisted of other payables of approximately $51,000. At December 31, 2017, Shengxin's assets consisted of cash, advances to supplier and fixed assets of approximately $17.3 million and $615,000 and $5,000, respectively, and had no liabilities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's share of Shengxin's net loss were $199,410 and $130,498, respectively.\nThrough December 30, 2016, we operated in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufactured and sold precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries, On December 30, 2016, we sold the stock in Fulland Wind, the subsidiary that operated our forged rolled rings and related components business, to a non-affiliated third party, as a result of which the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as a discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nAdditionally, during 2016, we operated a petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufactured and sold petroleum and chemical equipment. Because of a significant decline in revenues from this segment, we determined that we would not continue to operate in this segment and accordingly, the petroleum and chemical equipment segment is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRecently, difficult economic conditions, limited availability of credit in China and trade tensions with the US presented numerous challenges for our business. As a result, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers already upgraded to newer models and we believe that much of our remaining potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, if we are to sell our products to the smaller textile manufacturers, it may be necessary for us to design and market a cheaper machine that meets the Chinese government requirements or reduce prices which would impact both revenues and gross margin.\nOur ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue is largely affected by the PRC government's policy on such matters as the availability of credit, which affects all of our operations, and its policies relating to the textile industry, environmental issues and alternative energy as well as the competitiveness of Chinese textile manufacturers at a time when consumers are looking for lower prices and manufacturers are looking to produce in a country that has lower labor costs than China, all of which affects the market for our dyeing and finishing equipment. Our business is also affected by general economic conditions and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues in the near future, if at all. For example, tariffs levied on Chinese textile manufacturers by the US have a negative impact on our customers and limit their ability to purchase equipment from us. Because of the nature of our products, our customers' projections of future economic conditions are an integral part of their decisions as to whether to purchase capital equipment at this time or defer such purchases until a future date.\nGiven the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2018.\nRecent developments\nInspirit Studio\nDuring the period, BuddiGo, the sharing economy mobile platform developed by Inspirit Studio Limited ( Inspirit Studio\u201d), continuously promoted its service to the local market in Hong Kong. BuddiGo offers a wide range of errand services. Currently, about 80 percent of the orders [to be updated] received are for on-demand urgent delivery of items such as documents, flowers and cakes. Food delivery services are also available. During 2018, over 1,200 individuals have officially registered as sell-side buddies, who completed over 500 delivery orders in 2018, majority orders were happened in the third quarter. In addition, BuddiGo has signed up with a number of local business partners to provide ongoing delivery services for these clients. BuddiGo's goal is to connect with the community and deliver localized content featuring BuddiGo's core features and advantages. BuddiGo is actively seeking strategic investors or collaborative parties who are enthusiastic about its business model and can help achieve its business targets and expand into different countries.\nAnyWorkspace Limited\nAnyworkspace, our coworking business unit, is focused on enlarging its exposure to the general public. AnyWorkspace started showing positive traction in India as space providers from New Delhi and Gurgaon have signed partnership agreements with us. We are currently revamping AnyWorkspace's corporate website, www.anyworkspace.com. AnyWorkspace will also focus on digital marketing activities for its market expansion plans when there is available cash flow or funds from investors.\nGiven the existing coworking spaces providers marketing their available spaces and managing individual online business platform themselves, we expect our current global online platform will take years to materialize its worldwide customer base. Therefore, the intangible asset amounted to $0.6 million (equivalent to HK$4.97 million) representing the online platform acquired has been fully impaired in the last quarter of 2018.\n3D Discovery Co. Limited\n3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery's space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong's leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality (\"VR\") industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world's largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app, Autocap, which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.\n3D Discovery successfully completed a number of projects during the year. First, its 3D Virtual Tours in Hong Kong\u201d generated about 1,371,000 impressions in 2018. In addition, 3D Discovery partnered with Midland Realty, one of the largest real estate agencies in Hong Kong, to establish the Creation 200 3D Virtual Tours.\u201d This business unit generated HK$1.7 million in revenue in 2018.\nEC Advertising Limited\nFollowing the acquisition of BuddiGo, AnyWorkspace and 3D Discovery by the Company during the period between late 2017 and the first half year of 2018, EC Advertising Limited ( EC Advertising\u201d) has been developing opportunities for these three platforms to attract advertisers.\nDuring the period, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Xiamen, Fujian Province of Mainland China, which is intended to cover our advertising business in this region. We started meeting with a number of potential clients there and anticipate that this advertising company will confirm with them several marketing campaigns. In order to maximize our exposure to the potential clients in Mainland China, we are developing a strategic media plan which will cover major cities in Mainland China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Major banks, real estate developers and consumer products manufacturers and retailers are our target clients. More importantly, our presence in Mainland China can facilitate the rollout of franchise programs of our business units, which is one of the revenue drivers for the Company.\nECrent Platform Business\nAsia Region:\nIn 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a license agreement with ECRENT, regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Korea. According to the latest amendment, ECRENT will guarantee that the operation of its related websites, mobile applications and business services will contribute revenue of US$13,000,000 (increased from US$10,000,000 according to the previously amended agreement) and gross profit of US$2,522,000 (up from US$1,940,000 as stated on the previously amended agreement) from the closing date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2019 (extended from June 30, 2019 per the previously amended agreement).\nIn August, SEIL has entered into a License Agreement with PTI Corporation ( PTI\u201d), that sublicenses SEIL's exclusive license with ECRENT to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in South Korea. In return, PTI shall pay to SEIL $230,000 ( Consideration\u201d). The License Agreement will be effective on September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In addition, if the aggregate revenue during the period exceeds the Consideration, SEIL shall receive 30% of the difference between the aggregate revenue and the Consideration. During the third quarter of 2018, PTI commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform.\nEurope Region:\nIn August 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a License Agreement with ECRENT regarding the grant of an exclusive and sublicensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. In return, SEII shall issue to ECRENT 360,000 shares of restricted common stock. Closing of this transaction was conditioned on various conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. On October 9, 2018, the agreement was terminated by the parties, who have agreed to forego their respective rights under the agreement.\nGoing forward, we will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nA major element of our cost of revenues is raw materials, principally steel as well as other metals. These metals are subject to price fluctuations, and recently these fluctuations have been significant. In times of increasing prices, we need to try to establish the price at which we purchase raw materials in order to avoid increases in costs which we cannot recoup through increases in sales prices. Similarly, in times of decreasing prices, we may have purchased metals at prices which are high in terms of the price at which we can sell our products, which also can impair our margins. Four major suppliers provided 55% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2018. Four major suppliers provided 50% of our purchases of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2017. No supplier accounted for approximately 10% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2018. One supplier accounted for approximately 15% of the Company's total outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, the fair value of equity method investment, the fair value of assets held for sale and the valuation of equity transactions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nPursuant to ASC Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our consolidated financial statements the financial statements of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nDyeing is considered a VIE, and we are the primary beneficiary. On November 13, 2007, we entered into agreements with the Dyeing pursuant to which we shall receive 100% of Dyeing's net income. In accordance with these agreements, Dyeing shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Power, and Green Power shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service Dyeing.\nThe accounts of the Dyeing are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As a VIE, Dyeing's sales are included in our total sales, its income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of the Huayang Companies' net income, and their assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements, we have pecuniary interest in Dyeing that require consolidation of the Dyeing's financial statements with our financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAs a basis for estimating the likelihood of collection has been established, we consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value utilizing the weighted average method. An allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record additional reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, if necessary. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers represent the advance payments for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing and delivery.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Useful Life </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Building and building improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 20 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufacturing equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 10 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the year of disposition.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nLand Use Rights\nThere is no private ownership of land in the PRC. All land in the PRC is owned by the government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. The government grants a land use right that permits the holder of the land use right to use the land for a specified period. Our land use rights were granted with a term of 45 or 50 years. Any transfer of the land use right requires government approval. We have recorded as an intangible asset the costs paid to acquire a land use right. The land use rights are amortized on the straight-line method over the land use right terms.\nPatent Use Rights\nIn August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We amortize the exclusive patent use right over the term of the patent.\nIntangible Assets\nIn January 2018, in connection the acquisition of 3D Discovery and AnyWorkspace, the Company acquired their technologies. The technology of 3D Discovery covers a 3D virtual tour solution for the property industry and the technology of AnyWorkspace covers management software for an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, FASB issued an update Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). ASU 2014-09, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. This standard, which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. We adopted this standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires applying the new standard to all existing contracts not yet completed as of the effective date and recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Based on an evaluation of the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our sources of revenue, we have concluded that ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the process for, timing of, and presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition from customers.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of equipment upon shipment and transfer of title. The other elements may include installation and, generally, a one-year warranty. Equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and is recognized when the labor has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer, which is generally within a couple days of the delivery of the equipment. Warranty revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete a service and generally is recognized over the contract period.\nAll other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance and the delivery of the parts or service. Revenues related to spare part sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the trade terms.\nWe recognized revenue from the rental of batteries when earned.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC, Inland Revenue Ordinance of Hong Kong and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We account for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is charged to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d), a tax reform bill which, among other items, reduces the current federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%. The rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018, and is permanent.\nThe Act has caused the Company's deferred income taxes to be revalued. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense. Pursuant to the guidance within SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), as of December 31, 2017, the Company recognized the provisional effects of the enactment of the Act for which measurement could be reasonably estimated. Since the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the revaluation of the deferred tax assets did not have a material impact on any period presented. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from these estimates due to the Company's continued analysis or further regulatory guidance that may be issued as a result of the Act.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the vesting period or immediately if the award is non-forfeitable. The Accounting Standards Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 permits the election of an accounting policy for forfeitures of share-based payment awards, either to recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate forfeitures over the vesting period of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur and the cumulative impact of this change did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThrough September 30, 2018, pursuant to ASC 505-50 - Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d, all share-based payments to non-employees, including grants of stock options, were recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense over the service period of the consulting arrangement or until performance conditions are expected to be met. The Company periodically reassessed the fair value of non-employee share based payments until service conditions are met, which generally aligns with the vesting period of the equity instrument, and the Company adjusts the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements accordingly. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of the stock-based compensation guidance in ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions"
