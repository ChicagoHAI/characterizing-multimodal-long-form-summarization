Our money transfer services connect family and friends through an omnichannel network that delivers unparalleled choice and convenience. Whether through our mobile application, moneygram.com, integration with mobile wallets, a kiosk, or any one of the thousands of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories, we connect consumers in any way that is convenient for them. We also provide bill payment services, issue money orders and process official checks in the U.S. and in select countries and territories. We primarily offer our services and products through third-party agents and directly to consumers through our Digital solutions. Third-party agents include retail chains, independent retailers, post offices and financial institutions. Digital solutions include moneygram.com, mobile solutions, account deposit and kiosk-based services. MoneyGram also has a limited number of Company-operated retail locations.\nWe manage our revenue and related commissions expense through two reporting segments: Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products. The Global Funds Transfer segment provides global money transfer services in approximately 350,000 agent locations. Our global money transfer services are our primary revenue driver, accounting for 88% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Global Funds Transfer segment also provides bill payment services to consumers through substantially all of our money transfer agent locations, at certain agent locations in select Caribbean and European countries and through our Digital solutions. The Financial Paper Products segment provides money order services to consumers through retail locations and financial institutions located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and provides official check services to financial institutions in the U.S. Corporate expenses that are not related to our segments' performance are excluded from operating income for Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products segments.\nBusiness Environment\nIn 2018, worldwide political and economic conditions remained highly dynamic, as evidenced by both economic growth and political unrest in key markets, currency controls in certain countries and a volatile immigration environment. Given the global extent of the current political and economic conditions, money transfer volumes and the average face value of money transfers continue to be highly variable by corridor and country, but the overall remittance market continues to grow as indicated by the World Bank.\nThe competitive environment is also changing as both established players and new, digital-only entrants work to innovate and deliver a superior customer experience to win market share. As a result, in 2018, MoneyGram focused on positioning the company to better compete by building and expanding customer-centric digital capabilities, modernizing operations and expense structures, de-risking the business to better protect consumers and expanding our offerings through partnerships. As part of these initiatives, the Company was able to reduce costs and the capital expenditures associated with IT processes and its agent and consumer facing systems.\nWe generally compete on the basis of the customer experience, the ability to conduct both digital and cash transactions, price, the quantity and quality of our agent network, commission payments and marketing efforts. One way we improved our network in 2018 was by entering into new partnerships with OXXO and Visa Direct. OXXO is Mexico's largest convenience store retailer with more than 17,000 locations across the country. Visa Direct is Visa Inc.'s real-time push payments platform and our partnership will give customers the choice to receive funds either directly into their bank account or to a Visa prepaid card. Earlier in the year, the Company and Walmart, our largest agent, announced the launch of Walmart2World, Powered by MoneyGram, a new white-label money transfer service that allows customers to send money from Walmart in the U.S. to any MoneyGram location. The Company expects the Walmart2World products to continue to negatively impact our top-line growth during the first half of 2019\ndue to lower revenue per transaction, but we expect this negative impact to be partially offset by the new OXXO and Visa Direct partnerships.\nIn addition to the competitive environment, global compliance requirements are becoming increasingly more complex, which has been affecting our top line growth. In 2018, the Company launched new compliance measures including new global customer verification standards for all money transfer services, limits on transaction frequency and limits on the total amount of money an individual can send within a certain period of time. We continue to enhance our compliance tools to comply with various government and other regulatory programs around the world, as well as address corridor specific risks associated with fraud or money laundering. Due to the implementation of these compliance and fraud prevention measures, the Company has seen a negative impact on our top-line and Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2018 and we will continue to see the effects of our de-risking efforts in the first half of 2019.\nOn November 8, 2018, the Company announced that it entered into (1) the Amended DPA with the Government and (2) a Consent Order with the FTC. The motions underlying the Amended DPA and Consent Order focus primarily on the Company's anti-fraud and anti-money laundering programs, including whether the Company had adequate controls to prevent third parties from using its systems to commit fraud. Under the Agreements, the Company will, among other things, (1) pay an aggregate amount of $125.0 million to the Government, of which $70.0 million was paid in November 2018 and the remaining $55.0 million must be paid by May 8, 2020, eighteen months after the date of the Amended DPA, which is being made available to reimburse consumers who were the victims of third-party fraud conducted through the Company's money transfer services, and (2) continue to retain an independent compliance monitor until May 10, 2021 to review and assess actions taken by the Company under the Agreements to further enhance its compliance program. For more details see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are making progress toward becoming a digitally-enabled, customer-centric organization to better position the Company to compete with new entrants focused solely on digital money transfer solutions. We believe that our continued investment in innovative products and services, such as moneygram.com, mobile solutions including our new application, integration with mobile wallets, account deposit services and kiosk-based services, positions the Company to accelerate its digital transformation and diversify its product and service offerings to meet consumers' needs. Furthermore, we believe that combining our cash and digital capabilities enables us to differentiate against digital-only competitors who are not able to serve a significant portion of the remittance market that relies on cash. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring and reorganization program (the \"Digital Transformation Program\") to modernize the business, reduce operating expenses, focus on improving profitability and better align the organization to deliver new digital touch-points for customers and agents.\nDuring 2018, the Company decreased headcount, reduced costs related to outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant activities and accelerated its network optimization efforts by closing over 61,000 unproductive and/or higher risk locations globally. These efforts resulted in the elimination of overhead costs and a reduction in potential risks while improving productivity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company expanded its moneygram.com product platform to be available in 24 countries and will continue to improve and increase its presence during 2019. Digital solutions revenue for 2018 was $204.1 million, or 16% of money transfer revenue. Digital solutions revenue for 2017 was $211.6 million, or 14% of money transfer revenue. Moneygram.com revenue for 2018 grew by $7.0 million or 8% over 2017.\nIn connection with the Digital Transformation Program, which is expected to be substantially completed in 2019, the Company expects over 400 employees to be affected, possibly through transfers or terminations, representing over 14% of the Company's global workforce as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects to incur restructuring and reorganization charges between $24.5 million and $26.5 million, consisting primarily of severance and outplacement benefits (between $19.0 million and $19.5 million), real estate lease termination and other associated costs (between $3.0 million and $3.5 million), legal and other costs (between $2.0 million and $3.0 million), and reorganization costs (approximately $0.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $20.4 million of restructuring and reorganization charges. Additionally, the Company anticipates between $21.5 million and $23.5 million of the restructuring and reorganization charges to be paid in cash, $11.1 million of which were payments made in 2018, with the remaining expected to be made during 2019. We realized efficiencies that resulted in $30.5 million of expense reductions in 2018 and, upon completion, expect $55.0 million on an annualized basis. The actual timing and costs of the plan may differ from the Company's current expectations and estimates.\nAnticipated Trends\nThis discussion of trends expected to impact our business in 2019 is based on information presently available and reflects certain assumptions, including assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results. See Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward-looking statements.\nIn 2019, the industry will see a number of trends continue: the growth of digital transactions, the importance of customer experience and geopolitical volatility. To position the company to respond to these trends, we are focused on our strategy to deliver a\ndifferentiated customer experience, capitalize on the strength of our leading digital and physical footprint, accelerate growth in key regions and identify new areas of growth.\nWe continue to see increased opportunities to capitalize on growth and expansion through product and service offerings. The Company is growing its digital footprint through the introduction of new countries for the moneygram.com platform, new partnerships and the introduction of new ways to send and receive money. Furthermore, the Company is expanding its online presence through the continued growth of its new native application. MoneyGram is also enhancing its customer interface to provide a more personalized consumer experience. The personalized experience includes notifications through email and SMS text, profile services, as well as a new loyalty program. However, compliance measures and pricing pressure continue to negatively impact our growth specifically in the U.S. and West Africa, where we decided to be more selective and de-risk the business by placing larger restrictions on transactions. Furthermore, economic issues in Africa have restricted our ability to transact in certain markets. Currency volatility, liquidity pressure on central banks and pressure on labor markets in specific countries may continue to impact our business in 2019.\nThe June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (referred to as Brexit), which was followed by Britain providing official notice to leave the European Union in March of 2017, introduced additional uncertainty in global markets and currency exchange rates. We are currently unable to determine the long-term impact that Brexit will have on us, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. As the UK is expected to leave the European Union in the first quarter of 2019, the Company anticipates making a number of operational changes to accommodate any potential business impact.\nFor our Financial Paper Products segment, we expect the decline in overall paper-based transactions to continue primarily due to continued migration by customers to other payment methods. Our investment revenue, which consists primarily of interest income generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of our Financial Paper Products, is dependent on the interest rate environment. The Company would see a positive impact on its investment revenue if interest rates continue to rise. As interest rates also affect the payments we make for interest on our credit facility, our liquidity would be negatively impacted by the continued rise in interest rates. Furthermore, we have begun the process of refinancing our long-term debt, which could also impact our interest expense in 2019.\nFinancial Measures and Key Metrics\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use to assess our overall performance.\nGAAP Measures - We utilize certain financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to assess the Company's overall performance. These measures include fee and other revenue, fee and other commissions expense, fee and other revenue less commissions, operating income and operating margin.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. While we believe that these metrics enhance investors' understanding of our business, these metrics are not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies. The following are non-GAAP financial measures we use to assess our overall performance:\nEBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization)\nAdjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items) - Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness or tax payments that may result in a reduction in cash available.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes, cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses) - Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect cash payments related to the adjustment of certain significant items in Adjusted EBITDA.\nConstant Currency - Constant currency metrics assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year.\nThe Company utilizes specific terms related to our business throughout this document, including the following:\nCorridor - With regard to a money transfer transaction, the originating \"send\" location and the designated \"receive\" location are referred to as a corridor.\nCorridor mix - The relative impact of increases or decreases in money transfer transaction volume in each corridor versus the comparative prior period.\nFace value - The principal amount of each completed transaction, excluding any fees related to the transaction.\nForeign currency - The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues, commissions and other operating expenses for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table is a summary of the results of operations for the years ended December 31:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

revenue declined due to the decline in the Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which included the impact of de-risking the business through transaction and corridor specific compliance controls implemented during the year, Walmart2World service and increased competition. See the \"Segments Results\" section below for a detailed discussion of revenues by segment. In 2018, investment revenue increased primarily from higher yields, partially offset by the reduction in revenue related to the $12.2 million gain on a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security in 2017.\nIn 2017, total revenue declined primarily due to the decline in Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which was primarily driven by a negative change in corridor mix and a decrease in the average face value per transaction and pricing, partially offset by increased Non-U.S. and U.S. Outbound money transfer volume. Investment revenue in 2017 increased $23.2 million when compared to 2016 due to a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security as well as higher yields earned on investment balances.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table is a summary of the operating expenses for the years ended December 31:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commissions and direct transaction expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>732.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>814.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>259.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and operations support\n</td> <td>298.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy, equipment and supplies\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,535.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained flat when compared to 2017 as declines in revenue were offset by declines in operating expenses.\nIn 2017, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased when compared to 2016 due to an $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA matter.\nTotal Commissions and Direct Transaction Expenses\nIn 2018, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues slightly increased primarily from increases in investment commissions expense and signing bonus amortization, both of which are discussed in more detail below in the \"Segments Results\" section.\nIn 2017, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues remained flat when compared to 2016.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits include salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll taxes and other employee related costs.

These decreases were partially offset by the changes in exchange rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar.\nTransaction and Operations Support\nTransaction and operations support primarily includes marketing, professional fees and other outside services, telecommunications, agent support costs, including forms related to our products, non-compensation employee costs, including training, travel and relocation costs, director stock-based compensation expense, bank charges and the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table is a summary of the change in transaction and operations support from the respective prior year for the years ended December 31:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year ended\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change resulting from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal expenses\n</td> <td>(50.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing costs\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank charges\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct monitor costs\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loss\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel and entertainment expenses\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and reorganization costs\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year ended\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, transaction and operations support decreased primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses driven by the lower accrual recorded in 2018 for the DPA matter and decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant and other costs due to ongoing cost-savings initiatives related to the Digital Transformation Program. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the provision for loss primarily driven by an increase in moneygram.com revenues, the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts and restructuring and reorganization costs.\nIn 2017, transaction and operations support increased primarily due to an increase in legal expenses driven by the $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA and costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial. Additional factors contributing to the increase include the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts, direct monitor costs and bank charges from fees on foreign exchange trades. The increase was partially offset by decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs, marketing costs and a reduction in our provision for loss.\nOccupancy, Equipment and Supplies\nOccupancy, equipment and supplies expense include facilities rent and maintenance costs, software and equipment maintenance costs, freight and delivery costs and supplies.\nIn 2018, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense decreased by $4.1 million due to cost-savings from the Digital Transformation Program, reduced freight and delivery costs and a decrease in software maintenance costs.\nIn 2017, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense increased by $4.2 million as a result of an increase in equipment maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation on computer hardware and software, agent signage, point of sale equipment, capitalized software development costs, office furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.\nIn 2018, depreciation and amortization increased by $1.2 million because of accelerated depreciation from certain restructuring and other activities.\nIn 2017, depreciation and amortization decreased by $4.8 million as a result of higher costs during the first half of 2016 from the accelerated depreciation expense on our non-core point of sale equipment that was retired early.\nSegments Results\nGlobal Funds Transfer\nThe following table sets forth our Global Funds Transfer segment results of operations for the years ended December

The Company's Global Funds Transfer segment operating margin in 2018 also decreased by 0.7% when compared to 2017. The decline in operating income and margin during 2018 was due to the decline in money transfer fee and other revenue, as well as restructuring and reorganization costs, primarily driven by severance, which are discussed in Note 3 - Restructuring and Reorganization Costs of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decreases were partially offset by declines in fee and other commissions expense and other operating expenses as a result of cost-savings initiatives and the lower additional accrual recorded in 2018 for the DPA matter.\nFinancial Paper Products segment operating income and margin decreased in 2018 primarily due to the gain recognized on a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security in 2017, partially offset by investment income in 2018.\nOther operating loss decreased because 2017 included costs related to the proposed merger with Ant Financial that was terminated in January 2018. See Note 1 - Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the terminated merger.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn 2017, the Global Funds Transfer segment operating income and operating margin decreased due to a decline in money transfer fee and other revenue and an $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA discussed in more detail in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses as a result of various cost-saving initiatives throughout the year.\nThe Financial Paper Products segment operating income and operating margin increased when compared to 2016 due to higher segment revenues from the one-time redemption of an asset-backed security.\nThe increase in Other operating losses was primarily driven by costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial in 2017, partially offset by lower severance and related costs.\nOther Expenses\nTotal other expenses in 2018 were $29.4 million compared to $51.2 million in 2017. The decrease in other expenses of $21.8 million was due to the $30.0 million payment related to the terminated merger with Ant Financial, partially offset by the increase in interest expense.\nOther expenses in 2017 remained relatively flat when compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table represents our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the years ended December 31:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $13.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $10.9 million. The recorded income tax expense differs from taxes calculated at the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of the nondeductibility of the accrual related to the DPA as further discussed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the adverse tax consequences related to the new provisions enacted under the TCJA, partially offset by the one-time $3.6 million deferred tax benefit from a reorganization of our corporate structure.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $6.8 million on a pre-tax loss of $36.6 million. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate were the tax impacts of the TCJA, discussed below, and the tax impact of an accrual related to the DPA as further discussed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the TCJA, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $19.8 million tax benefit in the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the Company recognized a provisional net $3.0 million tax benefit for the remeasurement of previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with historical earnings in its foreign subsidiaries.\nOur provision for income taxes is volatile and could be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, ultimate settlements of the IRS matter further discussed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and examinations by tax authorities. We will continue to perform additional analysis on the application of the TCJA, taking into account any additional regulatory guidance that is issued by the applicable taxing authorities.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Constant Currency\nWe believe that EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items), Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes, cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses) and constant currency measures (which assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year) provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of the strength and performance of our ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry. In addition, our debt agreements require compliance with covenants that incorporate a financial measure similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and constant currency are financial and performance measures used by management in reviewing results of operations, forecasting, allocating resources and establishing employee incentive programs. We also present Adjusted EBITDA growth, constant currency adjusted, which provides information to investors regarding MoneyGram's performance without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations year-over-year.\nAlthough we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and constant currency measures enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the accompanying GAAP financial measures. These metrics are not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>53.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Signing bonus amortization\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant items impacting EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and contingent matters (1)\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Income) costs related to the terminated merger with Ant Financial (2)\n</td> <td>(29.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and reorganization costs\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compliance enhancement program\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based, contingent and incentive compensation\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct monitor costs\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and related costs\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA change, as reported\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA change, constant currency adjusted\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payments for interest\n</td> <td>(50.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payments for taxes, net of refunds\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payments for capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(57.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payments for agent signing bonuses\n</td> <td>(31.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) 2018 and 2017 include accruals of $40.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, related to the DPA matter.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Income includes the $30.0 million merger termination fee and costs include, but are not limited to, legal, bank and consultant fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nThe Company generated EBITDA of $172.9 million and $135.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $245.9 million and $275.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA declined when compared to the same period in 2017 because of a decrease in fee and other revenue, partially offset by decreases in fee and other commissions expense, net salaries, related payroll taxes and cash incentive compensation and outsourcing, and independent contractor and consultant costs as a result of ongoing cost-savings initiatives. The year-over-year change in Adjusted EBITDA was also negatively impacted due to a realized gain on a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, EBITDA increased due to the other non-operating income of $30.0 million related to the terminated merger with Ant Financial and the lower additional accrual recorded in 2018 for the DPA matter. The increase was partially offset by restructuring and reorganization costs primarily driven by severance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted Free Cash Flow decreased by $4.1 million. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and the increase in cash payments for interest, partially offset by decreases in cash payments for capital expenditures and agent signing bonuses.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nThe Company generated EBITDA of $135.7 million and $221.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $275.9 million and $264.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA increased when compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in total operating expenses driven by a decrease in net salaries, related payroll taxes and cash incentive compensation, outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs and marketing costs. EBITDA decreased primarily due to an $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA discussed in more detail in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements when compared to 2016.\nFor 2017, Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased by $9.0 million. The increase was a result of an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, decreases in payments for net cash taxes, partially offset by increases in agent signing bonuses.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" and \"Analysis of Cash Flows\" sections for additional information regarding these changes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have various resources available for purposes of managing liquidity and capital needs, including our investment portfolio, credit facilities and letters of credit. We refer to our cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing investments and available-for-sale investments collectively as our investment portfolio.\u201d The Company utilizes cash and cash equivalents in various liquidity and capital assessments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Settlement Assets and Payment Service Obligations\nThe following table shows the components of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets as of December 31:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlement assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlement cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>1,435.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,469.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables, net\n</td> <td>777.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing investments\n</td> <td>1,154.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale investments\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,373.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,756.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment service obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,373.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,756.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash flows generated by the sale of our payment instruments, our cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing investment balances, and proceeds from our investment portfolio. Our primary operating liquidity needs are related to the settlement of payment service obligations to our agents and financial institution customers, general operating expenses and debt service.\nTo meet our payment service obligations at all times, we must have sufficient highly liquid assets and be able to move funds globally on a timely basis. On average, we receive in and pay out a similar amount of funds on a daily basis to collect and settle the principal amount of our payment instruments sold and related fees and commissions with our end consumers and agents. This pattern of cash flows allows us to settle our payment service obligations through existing cash balances and ongoing cash generation rather than liquidating investments or utilizing our Revolving Credit Facility. We have historically generated, and expect to continue generating, sufficient cash flows from daily operations to fund ongoing operational needs.\nWe preposition cash in various countries and currencies to facilitate settlement of transactions. We also maintain funding capacity beyond our daily operating needs to provide a cushion through the normal fluctuations in our payment service obligations, as well as to provide working capital for the operational and growth requirements of our business. We believe we have sufficient liquid assets and funding capacity to operate and grow our business for the next 12 months. Should our liquidity needs exceed our operating cash flows, we believe that external financing sources, including availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated funding requirements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Interest-bearing Investments\nTo ensure we maintain adequate liquidity to meet our payment service obligations at all times, we keep a significant portion of our investment portfolio in cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing investments at financial institutions rated A- or better by two of the following three rating agencies: Moody's Investor Service (\"Moody's\"), Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\") and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\"Fitch\"); and in AAA rated U.S. government money market funds. If the rating agencies have split ratings, the Company uses the lower of the highest two out of three ratings across the agencies for disclosure purposes. If the institution has only two ratings, the Company uses the lower of the two ratings for disclosure purposes. As of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents (including unrestricted and settlement cash and cash equivalents) and interest-bearing investments totaled $2.7 billion. Cash and cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing deposit accounts, non-interest-bearing transaction accounts and money market securities; interest-bearing investments consist of time deposits and certificates of deposit with maturities of up to 24 months.\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nOur investment portfolio includes $5.7 million of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2018. U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities comprise $4.5 million of our available-for-sale investments, while asset-backed and other securities compose the remaining $1.2 million.\nClearing and Cash Management Banks\nWe collect and disburse money through a network of clearing and cash management banks. The relationships with these banks are a critical component of our ability to maintain our global active funding requirements on a timely basis. We have agreements with six active clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks, money orders and other draft instruments. We have four active official check clearing banks, which provide sufficient capacity for our official check business. We rely on three active banks to clear our retail money orders and believe that these banks provide sufficient capacity for that business. We also maintain relationships with a variety of domestic and international cash management banks for electronic funds transfer and wire transfer services used in the movement of consumer funds and agent settlements.\nCredit Facilities\nOn March 28, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"the 2013 Credit Agreement\") with Bank of America, N.A. (\"BOA\"), as administrative agent, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and the other agents party thereto. The 2013 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a senior secured five-year Revolving Credit Facility up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million and (ii) a senior secured seven-year term loan facility of $850.0 million ( Term Facility\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-facility that permits the Company to request the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million, with borrowings available for general corporate purposes and which would reduce the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn April 2, 2014, we entered into a First Incremental Amendment and Joinder Agreement (\"the Incremental Agreement\") with BOA, as administrative agent, and various lenders, which provided for (i) a tranche under the Term Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $130.0 million, (ii) an increase in the aggregate revolving loan commitments under the 2013 Credit Agreement from $125.0 million to $150.0 million, and (iii) certain other amendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement.\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2013 Credit Agreement (the \"2016 Amendment\") with BOA and various lenders. The 2016 Amendment includes, but is not limited to, decreasing the aggregate revolving credit commitments from $150.0 million to $125.0 million from December 12, 2016 to March 27, 2018 (the remainder of the original Revolving Credit Facility term), and increasing the maximum secured leverage ratio, effective the first quarter of 2017. The 2016 Amendment also extends the maturity date of the revolving credit commitments of the extending lenders, which represent commitments of $85.8 million in the aggregate, from March 28, 2018 to September 28, 2019.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, effective January 31, 2019 (the Amendment\u201d) to the 2013 Credit Agreement. The Amendment increased the maximum secured leverage ratio for the fourth quarter of 2018 from 3.75:1 to 4.00:1, for the first quarter of 2019 from 3.50:1 to 4.25:1 and for the second quarter of 2019 from 3.50:1 to 4.50:1. In addition, the Amendment decreased the aggregate revolving credit commitments from $85.8 million to $45.0 million and tightened certain negative covenant baskets for the benefit of the revolving lenders only when the pro forma secured leverage ratio of the Company is greater than 3.75:1. The Amendment also provides that in the event the Company's cash balance exceeds $140.0 million at the end of any month, the Company would be required to use such excess cash to pay any outstanding obligations to the revolving lenders under the 2013 Credit Agreement, and that the Company may not draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that the Company would have a cash balance in excess of $140.0 million after giving effect to such borrowing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had an outstanding balance of $904.4 million on its senior secured borrowings. The Company's effective interest rate on senior secured borrowings increased from 4.94% as of December 31, 2017 to 5.59% as of December 31, 2018, due to increases in the Eurodollar rate. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility, and subsequent to the January 31, 2019 amendment, the Company has $45.0 million of availability. See Note 9 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure related to the Company's credit facilities and financial covenants.\nCredit Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2018, our credit ratings from Moody's and S&P were B2 with a negative outlook and B with a stable outlook, respectively. Our credit facilities, regulatory capital requirements and other obligations will not be impacted by a future change in our credit ratings.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nWe have capital requirements relating to government regulations in the U.S. and other countries where we operate. Such regulations typically require us to maintain certain assets in a defined ratio to our payment service obligations. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary and licensed entity, MPSI, we are regulated in the U.S. by various state agencies that generally require us to maintain a pool of liquid assets and investments in an amount generally equal to the regulatory payment service obligation measure, as defined by each state, for our regulated payment instruments, namely teller checks, agent checks, money orders and money transfers.\nThe regulatory requirements do not require us to specify individual assets held to meet our payment service obligations, nor are we required to deposit specific assets into a trust, escrow or other special account. Rather, we must maintain a pool of liquid assets. Provided we maintain a total pool of liquid assets sufficient to meet the regulatory and contractual requirements, we are able to withdraw, deposit or sell our individual liquid assets at will, without prior notice, penalty or limitations. We were in compliance with all state and regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2018. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources will remain sufficient to ensure ongoing compliance with all regulatory capital requirements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table includes aggregated information about the Company's contractual obligations that impact our liquidity and capital needs. The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>967.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancellable leases (2)\n</td> <td>64.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPA settlement (3)\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Signing bonuses (4)\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing (5)\n</td> <td>48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,173.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,011.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 includes $904.4 million of debt, netted with unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount of $3.4 million.

It is our policy to fund at least the minimum required contribution each year plus additional discretionary amounts as available and necessary to minimize expenses of the plan. We made contributions of $8.0 million to the Pension Plan during 2018. Although the Company has no minimum contribution requirement for the Pension Plan in 2019, we expect to contribute $8.0 million to the Pension Plan in 2019.\nThe Company has certain unfunded defined benefit plans: supplemental executive retirement plans ( SERPs\u201d), which are unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plans providing postretirement income to their participants, and a postretirement plan (\"Postretirement Benefits\") that provides medical and life insurance for its participants. These plans require payments over extended periods of time. The Company will continue to make contributions to the SERPs and the Postretirement Benefits to the extent benefits are paid. Aggregate benefits paid for the unfunded plans are expected to be $5.7 million in 2019.\nAs discussed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's consolidated income tax returns through 2013 and issued Notices of Deficiency for 2005-2007 and 2009 and an Examination Report for 2008. The Notices of Deficiency and Examination Report disallow, among other items, approximately $900.0 million of ordinary deductions on securities losses in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax returns. In May 2012 and December 2012, the Company filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2005-2007 and 2009 Notices of Deficiency, respectively. In 2013, the Company reached a partial settlement with the IRS allowing ordinary loss treatment on $186.9 million of deductions in dispute. In January 2015, the U.S. Tax Court granted the IRS's motion for summary judgment upholding the remaining adjustments in the Notices of Deficiency. During 2015, the Company made payments to the IRS of $61.0 million for federal tax payments and associated interest related to the matter. The Company believes that it has substantive tax\nlaw arguments in favor of its position. The Company filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Tax Court on July 27, 2015 for an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Oral arguments were held before the Fifth Circuit on June 7, 2016, and on November 15, 2016, the Fifth Circuit vacated the Tax Court's decision and remanded the case to the Tax Court for further proceedings. The Company filed a motion for summary judgment in the Tax Court on May 31, 2017. On August 23, 2017, the IRS filed a motion for summary judgment and its response to the Company's motion for summary judgment. The Tax Court directed the parties to agree to a joint stipulation of facts, which the parties have filed with the court. Each party has filed a revised memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment in the Tax Court. The Tax Court is expected to schedule oral argument on this matter in early 2019. Pending the outcome of the appeal, the Company may be required to file amended state returns and make additional cash payments of up to $19.5 million on amounts that have previously been accrued.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(57.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(77.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2018, cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily from the $70.0 million payment related to the DPA matter made in November 2018, severance payments made in connection with the Digital Transformation Program and an increase in payments for interest of $8.8 million due to higher interest rates. The decrease was partially offset by the $30.0 million payment related to the terminated merger with Ant Financial, a decrease in cash spent on outsourcing and independent contractor and consultant costs, marketing and other costs as part of ongoing cost-savings initiatives and a decrease in signing bonus payments of $8.7 million, which included signing bonus recoveries of $1.7 million.\nDuring 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased due to a decrease in cash taxes, net and reduction in expenditures for working capital items. The increase was partially offset by an increase in signing bonus payments of $6.3 million driven by the timing of agent expansion and retention efforts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nItems impacting net cash used in investing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were from capital expenditures of $57.8 million, $83.6 million and $82.8 million, respectively. During 2018, as the Company modernized its infrastructure and employed more advanced computer programming techniques, it reduced costs and the capital expenditures associated with IT processes and its agent and consumer facing systems.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2018, items impacting net cash used in financing activities were $9.8 million of principal payments on debt and payments to tax authorities for stock-based compensation of $6.2 million. In 2017, items impacting net cash used in financing activities were $9.8 million of principal payments on debt and payments to tax authorities for stock-based compensation of $8.0 million.\nStockholders' Deficit\nStockholders' Deficit - The Company is authorized to repurchase up to 12,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased a total of 9,842,509 shares of our common stock under this authorization and have remaining authorization to purchase up to 2,157,491 shares.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding credit facilities, we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. No dividends were paid on our common stock in 2018, and we do not anticipate declaring any dividends on our common stock during 2019.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On a regular basis, management reviews its accounting policies, assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Based on these criteria, management has identified and discussed with the Audit Committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates, including the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates.\nGoodwill - We have two reporting units: Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products. Our Global Funds Transfer reporting unit is the only reporting unit that carries goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently upon occurrence of certain events. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to perform either a qualitative test or a quantitative test to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of any changes to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, and changes in overall financial performance, as well as any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment does not conclude that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. In a quantitative test, the fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis and further analyzed using other methods of valuation. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our long-term projections by reporting unit. In addition, an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years. Assumptions used in our impairment testing are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. Our discount rate is based on our debt and equity balances, adjusted for current market conditions and investor expectations of return on our equity. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If not, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a write-down of the reporting unit's goodwill would be necessary.\nWe did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss for 2018, 2017 or 2016. The carrying value of goodwill assigned to the Global Funds Transfer reporting unit at December 31, 2018 was $442.2 million. The annual impairment test indicated a fair value for the Global Funds Transfer reporting unit that was substantially in excess of the reporting unit's carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of the Global Funds Transfer reporting unit. Had the estimated fair value been hypothetically lower by 10% as of December 31, 2018, the fair value of goodwill would still be substantially in excess of the reporting unit's carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, after the October 1 test date, the Company's stock price changed from $5.35 per share on October 1, 2018, to a low point of $1.59 per share and closed on December 31, 2018 at $2.00 per share. The Company evaluated the impact of the decline in the stock price, which did not fall below our Global Funds Transfer reporting unit book value. As of December 31, 2018, the Global Funds Transfer reporting unit fair value is still substantially in excess of the reporting unit's carrying value and there were no qualitative factors that indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value.\nPension - Through the Company's Pension Plan and SERPs, collectively referred to as our \"Pension,\" we provide defined benefit pension plan coverage to certain of our employees and certain employees of Viad Corporation, our former parent. Our pension obligations under these plans are measured as of December 31, the measurement date. Pension benefit obligations and the related expense are based upon actuarial projections using assumptions regarding mortality, discount rates, long-term return on assets and other factors.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Certain of the assumptions, particularly the discount rate and expected return on plan assets, require significant judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation.\nIn order to estimate the interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense for its Pension and Postretirement Benefits, the Company utilizes a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rate used to measure total benefit obligation for the Pension and Postretirement Benefits is based on the then current interest rate yield curves for long-term corporate debt securities with maturities rated AA comparable to our obligations.\nOur Pension Plan assets are primarily invested in commingled trust funds. Our investments are periodically realigned in accordance with the investment guidelines. The expected return on Pension Plan assets is based on our historical market experience, our asset allocations and our expectations for long-term rates of return. We also consider peer data and historical returns to assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of our assumption. Our Pension Plan asset allocations are reviewed periodically and are based upon plan funded ratio, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.\nLower discount rates increase the Pension and Postretirement Benefits obligation and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease the Pension and Postretirement Benefits obligation and subsequent year pension expense. Decreasing the discount rate by 50 basis points would have increased the 2018 Pension and Postretirement Benefits net periodic benefit expense by $0.5 million. If the discount rate increased by 50 basis points, the Pension and Postretirement Benefits net periodic benefit\nexpense would have decreased by $0.5 million. Decreasing the expected rate of return by 50 basis points would have increased the 2018 Pension Plan net periodic benefit expense by $0.5 million and increasing the expected rate of return by 50 basis points would have decreased the 2018 Pension Plan net periodic benefit expense by $0.5 million.\nIncome Taxes, Tax Contingencies - We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. In determining taxable income, income or loss before taxes is adjusted for differences between local tax laws and GAAP.\nWe file tax returns in multiple states within the U.S. and various countries. Generally, our tax filings are subject to audit by tax authorities for three to five years following submission of a return. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to foreign or U.S., state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2013. The U.S. federal income tax filings are subject to audit for fiscal years 2015 through 2018.\nThe benefits of tax positions are recorded in the income statement if we determine it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including any related appeals or litigation. The one exception to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is the reliance on past administrative practices and precedents, where a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant facts will accept a position as filed. In these limited situations, the Company will recognize the associated tax benefit.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year. The determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions and the sources and character of income and tax credits.\nThese assumptions and probabilities are periodically reviewed and revised based upon new information.\nChanges in our current estimates due to unanticipated events, or other factors, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actual tax amounts may be materially different from amounts accrued based upon the results of audits due to different interpretations by the tax authorities than those of the Company. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, an unfavorable tax settlement generally requires the use of cash and an increase in the amount of income tax expense that we recognize. A favorable tax settlement generally requires a decrease in the amount of income taxes that we recognize.\nIncome Taxes, Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets must be reduced through valuation allowances if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In the period in which a valuation allowance is recorded, we would record tax expense, whereas a tax benefit would be recorded in the period a valuation allowance is released.\nIn assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted requires judgment and is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We consider, among other matters: the nature, frequency and severity of any cumulative financial reporting losses; the ability to carry back losses to prior years; future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; tax planning strategies and projections of future taxable income. We also consider our best estimate of the outcome of any on-going examinations based on the technical merits of the position, historical procedures and case law, among other items.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have recorded valuation allowances of $68.9 million against deferred tax assets of $104.7 million. The valuation allowances primarily relate to basis differences in revalued investments, capital losses and certain foreign tax loss carryovers. While we believe that the basis for estimating our valuation allowances is appropriate, changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events, or other factors, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the Company recorded, in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $19.8 million provisional tax benefit related to the remeasurement of its net U.S. deferred tax liabilities from 35% to 21%, along with a $3.0 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with historical earnings on its foreign subsidiaries.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA giving consideration to additional notices and proposed regulations made available as of December 31, 2018. As a result of the additional information obtained and analyzed during the measurement period, the Company recognized an additional net tax benefit of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax benefit recognized as a result of the enactment was $20.1 million\ntax benefit related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and $4.0 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with historical earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. In light of the pending regulations surrounding the TCJA, we will continue to examine the impact the new tax law has on the Company, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe TCJA includes global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") provisions, which impose a U.S. income inclusion on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 235-10-50, the Company elected in the fourth quarter of 2018 to treat GILTI inclusions as a current period expense when incurred under ASC Topic 740, \"Income Taxes.\"\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRecent accounting developments are set forth in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to, among other things, the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of MoneyGram and its subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed below under the caption Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe comparisons presented in this discussion refer to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted. This discussion is organized in the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \nOverview\nMoneyGram is a leading global financial technology company that provides innovative services around the world. Our money transfer services connect family and friends through an omnichannel network that delivers unparalleled choice and convenience. Whether through our mobile application, moneygram.com, integration with mobile wallets, a kiosk, or any one of the thousands of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories, we connect consumers in any way that is convenient for them. We also provide bill payment services, issue money orders and process official checks in the U.S. and in select countries and territories. We primarily offer our services and products through third-party agents and directly to consumers through our Digital solutions. Third-party agents include retail chains, independent retailers, post offices and financial institutions. Digital solutions include moneygram.com, mobile solutions, account deposit and kiosk-based services. MoneyGram also has a limited number of Company-operated retail locations.\nWe manage our revenue and related commissions expense through two reporting segments: Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products. The Global Funds Transfer segment provides global money transfer services in approximately 350,000 agent locations. Our global money transfer services are our primary revenue driver, accounting for 88% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Global Funds Transfer segment also provides bill payment services to consumers through substantially all of our money transfer agent locations, at certain agent locations in select Caribbean and European countries and through our Digital solutions. The Financial Paper Products segment provides money order services to consumers through retail locations and financial institutions located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and provides official check services to financial institutions in the U.S. Corporate expenses that are not related to our segments' performance are excluded from operating income for Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products segments.\nBusiness Environment\nIn 2018, worldwide political and economic conditions remained highly dynamic, as evidenced by both economic growth and political unrest in key markets, currency controls in certain countries and a volatile immigration environment. Given the global extent of the current political and economic conditions, money transfer volumes and the average face value of money transfers continue to be highly variable by corridor and country, but the overall remittance market continues to grow as indicated by the World Bank.\nThe competitive environment is also changing as both established players and new, digital-only entrants work to innovate and deliver a superior customer experience to win market share. As a result, in 2018, MoneyGram focused on positioning the company to better compete by building and expanding customer-centric digital capabilities, modernizing operations and expense structures, de-risking the business to better protect consumers and expanding our offerings through partnerships. As part of these initiatives, the Company was able to reduce costs and the capital expenditures associated with IT processes and its agent and consumer facing systems.\nWe generally compete on the basis of the customer experience, the ability to conduct both digital and cash transactions, price, the quantity and quality of our agent network, commission payments and marketing efforts. One way we improved our network in 2018 was by entering into new partnerships with OXXO and Visa Direct. OXXO is Mexico's largest convenience store retailer with more than 17,000 locations across the country. Visa Direct is Visa Inc.'s real-time push payments platform and our partnership will give customers the choice to receive funds either directly into their bank account or to a Visa prepaid card. Earlier in the year, the Company and Walmart, our largest agent, announced the launch of Walmart2World, Powered by MoneyGram, a new white-label money transfer service that allows customers to send money from Walmart in the U.S. to any MoneyGram location. The Company expects the Walmart2World products to continue to negatively impact our top-line growth during the first half of 2019\ndue to lower revenue per transaction, but we expect this negative impact to be partially offset by the new OXXO and Visa Direct partnerships.\nIn addition to the competitive environment, global compliance requirements are becoming increasingly more complex, which has been affecting our top line growth. In 2018, the Company launched new compliance measures including new global customer verification standards for all money transfer services, limits on transaction frequency and limits on the total amount of money an individual can send within a certain period of time. We continue to enhance our compliance tools to comply with various government and other regulatory programs around the world, as well as address corridor specific risks associated with fraud or money laundering. Due to the implementation of these compliance and fraud prevention measures, the Company has seen a negative impact on our top-line and Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2018 and we will continue to see the effects of our de-risking efforts in the first half of 2019.\nOn November 8, 2018, the Company announced that it entered into (1) the Amended DPA with the Government and (2) a Consent Order with the FTC. The motions underlying the Amended DPA and Consent Order focus primarily on the Company's anti-fraud and anti-money laundering programs, including whether the Company had adequate controls to prevent third parties from using its systems to commit fraud. Under the Agreements, the Company will, among other things, (1) pay an aggregate amount of $125.0 million to the Government, of which $70.0 million was paid in November 2018 and the remaining $55.0 million must be paid by May 8, 2020, eighteen months after the date of the Amended DPA, which is being made available to reimburse consumers who were the victims of third-party fraud conducted through the Company's money transfer services, and (2) continue to retain an independent compliance monitor until May 10, 2021 to review and assess actions taken by the Company under the Agreements to further enhance its compliance program. For more details see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are making progress toward becoming a digitally-enabled, customer-centric organization to better position the Company to compete with new entrants focused solely on digital money transfer solutions. We believe that our continued investment in innovative products and services, such as moneygram.com, mobile solutions including our new application, integration with mobile wallets, account deposit services and kiosk-based services, positions the Company to accelerate its digital transformation and diversify its product and service offerings to meet consumers' needs. Furthermore, we believe that combining our cash and digital capabilities enables us to differentiate against digital-only competitors who are not able to serve a significant portion of the remittance market that relies on cash. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring and reorganization program (the \"Digital Transformation Program\") to modernize the business, reduce operating expenses, focus on improving profitability and better align the organization to deliver new digital touch-points for customers and agents.\nDuring 2018, the Company decreased headcount, reduced costs related to outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant activities and accelerated its network optimization efforts by closing over 61,000 unproductive and/or higher risk locations globally. These efforts resulted in the elimination of overhead costs and a reduction in potential risks while improving productivity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company expanded its moneygram.com product platform to be available in 24 countries and will continue to improve and increase its presence during 2019. Digital solutions revenue for 2018 was $204.1 million, or 16% of money transfer revenue. Digital solutions revenue for 2017 was $211.6 million, or 14% of money transfer revenue. Moneygram.com revenue for 2018 grew by $7.0 million or 8% over 2017.\nIn connection with the Digital Transformation Program, which is expected to be substantially completed in 2019, the Company expects over 400 employees to be affected, possibly through transfers or terminations, representing over 14% of the Company's global workforce as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects to incur restructuring and reorganization charges between $24.5 million and $26.5 million, consisting primarily of severance and outplacement benefits (between $19.0 million and $19.5 million), real estate lease termination and other associated costs (between $3.0 million and $3.5 million), legal and other costs (between $2.0 million and $3.0 million), and reorganization costs (approximately $0.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $20.4 million of restructuring and reorganization charges. Additionally, the Company anticipates between $21.5 million and $23.5 million of the restructuring and reorganization charges to be paid in cash, $11.1 million of which were payments made in 2018, with the remaining expected to be made during 2019. We realized efficiencies that resulted in $30.5 million of expense reductions in 2018 and, upon completion, expect $55.0 million on an annualized basis. The actual timing and costs of the plan may differ from the Company's current expectations and estimates.\nAnticipated Trends\nThis discussion of trends expected to impact our business in 2019 is based on information presently available and reflects certain assumptions, including assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results. See Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward-looking statements.\nIn 2019, the industry will see a number of trends continue: the growth of digital transactions, the importance of customer experience and geopolitical volatility. To position the company to respond to these trends, we are focused on our strategy to deliver a\ndifferentiated customer experience, capitalize on the strength of our leading digital and physical footprint, accelerate growth in key regions and identify new areas of growth.\nWe continue to see increased opportunities to capitalize on growth and expansion through product and service offerings. The Company is growing its digital footprint through the introduction of new countries for the moneygram.com platform, new partnerships and the introduction of new ways to send and receive money. Furthermore, the Company is expanding its online presence through the continued growth of its new native application. MoneyGram is also enhancing its customer interface to provide a more personalized consumer experience. The personalized experience includes notifications through email and SMS text, profile services, as well as a new loyalty program. However, compliance measures and pricing pressure continue to negatively impact our growth specifically in the U.S. and West Africa, where we decided to be more selective and de-risk the business by placing larger restrictions on transactions. Furthermore, economic issues in Africa have restricted our ability to transact in certain markets. Currency volatility, liquidity pressure on central banks and pressure on labor markets in specific countries may continue to impact our business in 2019.\nThe June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (referred to as Brexit), which was followed by Britain providing official notice to leave the European Union in March of 2017, introduced additional uncertainty in global markets and currency exchange rates. We are currently unable to determine the long-term impact that Brexit will have on us, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. As the UK is expected to leave the European Union in the first quarter of 2019, the Company anticipates making a number of operational changes to accommodate any potential business impact.\nFor our Financial Paper Products segment, we expect the decline in overall paper-based transactions to continue primarily due to continued migration by customers to other payment methods. Our investment revenue, which consists primarily of interest income generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of our Financial Paper Products, is dependent on the interest rate environment. The Company would see a positive impact on its investment revenue if interest rates continue to rise. As interest rates also affect the payments we make for interest on our credit facility, our liquidity would be negatively impacted by the continued rise in interest rates. Furthermore, we have begun the process of refinancing our long-term debt, which could also impact our interest expense in 2019.\nFinancial Measures and Key Metrics\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use to assess our overall performance.\nGAAP Measures - We utilize certain financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to assess the Company's overall performance. These measures include fee and other revenue, fee and other commissions expense, fee and other revenue less commissions, operating income and operating margin.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. While we believe that these metrics enhance investors' understanding of our business, these metrics are not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies. The following are non-GAAP financial measures we use to assess our overall performance:\nEBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization)\nAdjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items) - Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness or tax payments that may result in a reduction in cash available.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes, cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses) - Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect cash payments related to the adjustment of certain significant items in Adjusted EBITDA.\nConstant Currency - Constant currency metrics assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year.\nThe Company utilizes specific terms related to our business throughout this document, including the following:\nCorridor - With regard to a money transfer transaction, the originating \"send\" location and the designated \"receive\" location are referred to as a corridor.\nCorridor mix - The relative impact of increases or decreases in money transfer transaction volume in each corridor versus the comparative prior period.\nFace value - The principal amount of each completed transaction, excluding any fees related to the transaction.\nForeign currency - The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues, commissions and other operating expenses for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table is a summary of the results of operations for the years ended December 31:\n\nNM = Not meaningful\nRevenues\nThe following table is a summary of the revenues for the years ended December 31:\n\nIn 2018, total revenue declined due to the decline in the Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which included the impact of de-risking the business through transaction and corridor specific compliance controls implemented during the year, Walmart2World service and increased competition. See the \"Segments Results\" section below for a detailed discussion of revenues by segment. In 2018, investment revenue increased primarily from higher yields, partially offset by the reduction in revenue related to the $12.2 million gain on a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security in 2017.\nIn 2017, total revenue declined primarily due to the decline in Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which was primarily driven by a negative change in corridor mix and a decrease in the average face value per transaction and pricing, partially offset by increased Non-U.S. and U.S. Outbound money transfer volume. Investment revenue in 2017 increased $23.2 million when compared to 2016 due to a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security as well as higher yields earned on investment balances.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table is a summary of the operating expenses for the years ended December 31:\n\nIn 2018, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained flat when compared to 2017 as declines in revenue were offset by declines in operating expenses.\nIn 2017, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased when compared to 2016 due to an $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA matter.\nTotal Commissions and Direct Transaction Expenses\nIn 2018, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues slightly increased primarily from increases in investment commissions expense and signing bonus amortization, both of which are discussed in more detail below in the \"Segments Results\" section.\nIn 2017, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues remained flat when compared to 2016.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits include salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll taxes and other employee related costs. The following table is a summary of the change in compensation and benefits from the respective prior year for the years ended December 31:\n\nIn 2018, compensation and benefits decreased primarily due to a decrease in net salaries, related payroll taxes and cash incentive compensation due to the reduction in headcount, partially offset by the restructuring and reorganization costs discussed in Note 3 - Restructuring and Reorganization Costs of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2017, compensation and benefits decreased due to the decrease in net salaries, related payroll taxes and cash incentive compensation primarily driven by lower headcount, a decrease in severance and related costs and lower employee stock-based compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by the changes in exchange rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar.\nTransaction and Operations Support\nTransaction and operations support primarily includes marketing, professional fees and other outside services, telecommunications, agent support costs, including forms related to our products, non-compensation employee costs, including training, travel and relocation costs, director stock-based compensation expense, bank charges and the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table is a summary of the change in transaction and operations support from the respective prior year for the years ended December 31:\n\nIn 2018, transaction and operations support decreased primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses driven by the lower accrual recorded in 2018 for the DPA matter and decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant and other costs due to ongoing cost-savings initiatives related to the Digital Transformation Program. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the provision for loss primarily driven by an increase in moneygram.com revenues, the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts and restructuring and reorganization costs.\nIn 2017, transaction and operations support increased primarily due to an increase in legal expenses driven by the $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA and costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial. Additional factors contributing to the increase include the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts, direct monitor costs and bank charges from fees on foreign exchange trades. The increase was partially offset by decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs, marketing costs and a reduction in our provision for loss.\nOccupancy, Equipment and Supplies\nOccupancy, equipment and supplies expense include facilities rent and maintenance costs, software and equipment maintenance costs, freight and delivery costs and supplies.\nIn 2018, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense decreased by $4.1 million due to cost-savings from the Digital Transformation Program, reduced freight and delivery costs and a decrease in software maintenance costs.\nIn 2017, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense increased by $4.2 million as a result of an increase in equipment maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation on computer hardware and software, agent signage, point of sale equipment, capitalized software development costs, office furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.\nIn 2018, depreciation and amortization increased by $1.2 million because of accelerated depreciation from certain restructuring and other activities.\nIn 2017, depreciation and amortization decreased by $4.8 million as a result of higher costs during the first half of 2016 from the accelerated depreciation expense on our non-core point of sale equipment that was retired early.\nSegments Results\nGlobal Funds Transfer\nThe following table sets forth our Global Funds Transfer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31:\n\nMoney Transfer Fee and Other Revenue\nThe following table details the changes in money transfer fee and other revenue from the respective prior year for", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed below under the caption Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe comparisons presented in this discussion refer to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted. This discussion is organized in the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \nOverview\nMoneyGram is a leading global financial technology company that provides innovative services around the world. Our money transfer services connect family and friends through an omnichannel network that delivers unparalleled choice and convenience. Whether through our mobile application, moneygram.com, integration with mobile wallets, a kiosk, or any one of the thousands of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories, we connect consumers in any way that is convenient for them. We also provide bill payment services, issue money orders and process official checks in the U.S. and in select countries and territories. We primarily offer our services and products through third-party agents and directly to consumers through our Digital solutions. Third-party agents include retail chains, independent retailers, post offices and financial institutions. Digital solutions include moneygram.com, mobile solutions, account deposit and kiosk-based services. MoneyGram also has a limited number of Company-operated retail locations.\nWe manage our revenue and related commissions expense through two reporting segments: Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products. The Global Funds Transfer segment provides global money transfer services in approximately 350,000 agent locations. Our global money transfer services are our primary revenue driver, accounting for 88% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Global Funds Transfer segment also provides bill payment services to consumers through substantially all of our money transfer agent locations, at certain agent locations in select Caribbean and European countries and through our Digital solutions. The Financial Paper Products segment provides money order services to consumers through retail locations and financial institutions located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and provides official check services to financial institutions in the U.S. Corporate expenses that are not related to our segments' performance are excluded from operating income for Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products segments.\nBusiness Environment\nIn 2018, worldwide political and economic conditions remained highly dynamic, as evidenced by both economic growth and political unrest in key markets, currency controls in certain countries and a volatile immigration environment. Given the global extent of the current political and economic conditions, money transfer volumes and the average face value of money transfers continue to be highly variable by corridor and country, but the overall remittance market continues to grow as indicated by the World Bank.\nThe competitive environment is also changing as both established players and new, digital-only entrants work to innovate and deliver a superior customer experience to win market share. As a result, in 2018, MoneyGram focused on positioning the company to better compete by building and expanding customer-centric digital capabilities, modernizing operations and expense structures, de-risking the business to better protect consumers and expanding our offerings through partnerships. As part of these initiatives, the Company was able to reduce costs and the capital expenditures associated with IT processes and its agent and consumer facing systems.\nWe generally compete on the basis of the customer experience, the ability to conduct both digital and cash transactions, price, the quantity and quality of our agent network, commission payments and marketing efforts. One way we improved our network in 2018 was by entering into new partnerships with OXXO and Visa Direct. OXXO is Mexico's largest convenience store retailer with more than 17,000 locations across the country. Visa Direct is Visa Inc.'s real-time push payments platform and our partnership will give customers the choice to receive funds either directly into their bank account or to a Visa prepaid card. Earlier in the year, the Company and Walmart, our largest agent, announced the launch of Walmart2World, Powered by MoneyGram, a new white-label money transfer service that allows customers to send money from Walmart in the U.S. to any MoneyGram location. The Company expects the Walmart2World products to continue to negatively impact our top-line growth during the first half of 2019\ndue to lower revenue per transaction, but we expect this negative impact to be partially offset by the new OXXO and Visa Direct partnerships.\nIn addition to the competitive environment, global compliance requirements are becoming increasingly more complex, which has been affecting our top line growth. In 2018, the Company launched new compliance measures including new global customer verification standards for all money transfer services, limits on transaction frequency and limits on the total amount of money an individual can send within a certain period of time. We continue to enhance our compliance tools to comply with various government and other regulatory programs around the world, as well as address corridor specific risks associated with fraud or money laundering. Due to the implementation of these compliance and fraud prevention measures, the Company has seen a negative impact on our top-line and Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2018 and we will continue to see the effects of our de-risking efforts in the first half of 2019.\nOn November 8, 2018, the Company announced that it entered into (1) the Amended DPA with the Government and (2) a Consent Order with the FTC. The motions underlying the Amended DPA and Consent Order focus primarily on the Company's anti-fraud and anti-money laundering programs, including whether the Company had adequate controls to prevent third parties from using its systems to commit fraud. Under the Agreements, the Company will, among other things, (1) pay an aggregate amount of $125.0 million to the Government, of which $70.0 million was paid in November 2018 and the remaining $55.0 million must be paid by May 8, 2020, eighteen months after the date of the Amended DPA, which is being made available to reimburse consumers who were the victims of third-party fraud conducted through the Company's money transfer services, and (2) continue to retain an independent compliance monitor until May 10, 2021 to review and assess actions taken by the Company under the Agreements to further enhance its compliance program. For more details see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are making progress toward becoming a digitally-enabled, customer-centric organization to better position the Company to compete with new entrants focused solely on digital money transfer solutions. We believe that our continued investment in innovative products and services, such as moneygram.com, mobile solutions including our new application, integration with mobile wallets, account deposit services and kiosk-based services, positions the Company to accelerate its digital transformation and diversify its product and service offerings to meet consumers' needs. Furthermore, we believe that combining our cash and digital capabilities enables us to differentiate against digital-only competitors who are not able to serve a significant portion of the remittance market that relies on cash. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring and reorganization program (the \"Digital Transformation Program\") to modernize the business, reduce operating expenses, focus on improving profitability and better align the organization to deliver new digital touch-points for customers and agents.\nDuring 2018, the Company decreased headcount, reduced costs related to outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant activities and accelerated its network optimization efforts by closing over 61,000 unproductive and/or higher risk locations globally. These efforts resulted in the elimination of overhead costs and a reduction in potential risks while improving productivity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company expanded its moneygram.com product platform to be available in 24 countries and will continue to improve and increase its presence during 2019. Digital solutions revenue for 2018 was $204.1 million, or 16% of money transfer revenue. Digital solutions revenue for 2017 was $211.6 million, or 14% of money transfer revenue. Moneygram.com revenue for 2018 grew by $7.0 million or 8% over 2017.\nIn connection with the Digital Transformation Program, which is expected to be substantially completed in 2019, the Company expects over 400 employees to be affected, possibly through transfers or terminations, representing over 14% of the Company's global workforce as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects to incur restructuring and reorganization charges between $24.5 million and $26.5 million, consisting primarily of severance and outplacement benefits (between $19.0 million and $19.5 million), real estate lease termination and other associated costs (between $3.0 million and $3.5 million), legal and other costs (between $2.0 million and $3.0 million), and reorganization costs (approximately $0.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $20.4 million of restructuring and reorganization charges. Additionally, the Company anticipates between $21.5 million and $23.5 million of the restructuring and reorganization charges to be paid in cash, $11.1 million of which were payments made in 2018, with the remaining expected to be made during 2019. We realized efficiencies that resulted in $30.5 million of expense reductions in 2018 and, upon completion, expect $55.0 million on an annualized basis. The actual timing and costs of the plan may differ from the Company's current expectations and estimates.\nAnticipated Trends\nThis discussion of trends expected to impact our business in 2019 is based on information presently available and reflects certain assumptions, including assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results. See Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward-looking statements.\nIn 2019, the industry will see a number of trends continue: the growth of digital transactions, the importance of customer experience and geopolitical volatility. To position the company to respond to these trends, we are focused on our strategy to deliver a\ndifferentiated customer experience, capitalize on the strength of our leading digital and physical footprint, accelerate growth in key regions and identify new areas of growth.\nWe continue to see increased opportunities to capitalize on growth and expansion through product and service offerings. The Company is growing its digital footprint through the introduction of new countries for the moneygram.com platform, new partnerships and the introduction of new ways to send and receive money. Furthermore, the Company is expanding its online presence through the continued growth of its new native application. MoneyGram is also enhancing its customer interface to provide a more personalized consumer experience. The personalized experience includes notifications through email and SMS text, profile services, as well as a new loyalty program. However, compliance measures and pricing pressure continue to negatively impact our growth specifically in the U.S. and West Africa, where we decided to be more selective and de-risk the business by placing larger restrictions on transactions. Furthermore, economic issues in Africa have restricted our ability to transact in certain markets. Currency volatility, liquidity pressure on central banks and pressure on labor markets in specific countries may continue to impact our business in 2019.\nThe June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (referred to as Brexit), which was followed by Britain providing official notice to leave the European Union in March of 2017, introduced additional uncertainty in global markets and currency exchange rates. We are currently unable to determine the long-term impact that Brexit will have on us, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. As the UK is expected to leave the European Union in the first quarter of 2019, the Company anticipates making a number of operational changes to accommodate any potential business impact.\nFor our Financial Paper Products segment, we expect the decline in overall paper-based transactions to continue primarily due to continued migration by customers to other payment methods. Our investment revenue, which consists primarily of interest income generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of our Financial Paper Products, is dependent on the interest rate environment. The Company would see a positive impact on its investment revenue if interest rates continue to rise. As interest rates also affect the payments we make for interest on our credit facility, our liquidity would be negatively impacted by the continued rise in interest rates. Furthermore, we have begun the process of refinancing our long-term debt, which could also impact our interest expense in 2019.\nFinancial Measures and Key Metrics\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use to assess our overall performance.\nGAAP Measures - We utilize certain financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to assess the Company's overall performance. These measures include fee and other revenue, fee and other commissions expense, fee and other revenue less commissions, operating income and operating margin.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. While we believe that these metrics enhance investors' understanding of our business, these metrics are not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies. The following are non-GAAP financial measures we use to assess our overall performance:\nEBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization)\nAdjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items) - Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness or tax payments that may result in a reduction in cash available.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes, cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses) - Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect cash payments related to the adjustment of certain significant items in Adjusted EBITDA.\nConstant Currency - Constant currency metrics assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year.\nThe Company utilizes specific terms related to our business throughout this document, including the following:\nCorridor - With regard to a money transfer transaction, the originating \"send\" location and the designated \"receive\" location are referred to as a corridor.\nCorridor mix - The relative impact of increases or decreases in money transfer transaction volume in each corridor versus the comparative prior period.\nFace value - The principal amount of each completed transaction, excluding any fees related to the transaction.\nForeign currency - The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues, commissions and other operating expenses for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table is a summary of the results of operations for the years ended December 31:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

revenue declined due to the decline in the Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which included the impact of de-risking the business through transaction and corridor specific compliance controls implemented during the year, Walmart2World service and increased competition. See the \"Segments Results\" section below for a detailed discussion of revenues by segment. In 2018, investment revenue increased primarily from higher yields, partially offset by the reduction in revenue related to the $12.2 million gain on a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security in 2017.\nIn 2017, total revenue declined primarily due to the decline in Global Funds Transfer fee and other revenue, which was primarily driven by a negative change in corridor mix and a decrease in the average face value per transaction and pricing, partially offset by increased Non-U.S. and U.S. Outbound money transfer volume. Investment revenue in 2017 increased $23.2 million when compared to 2016 due to a one-time redemption of an asset-backed security as well as higher yields earned on investment balances.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table is a summary of the operating expenses for the years ended December 31:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commissions and direct transaction expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>732.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>814.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>259.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and operations support\n</td> <td>298.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy, equipment and supplies\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,535.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained flat when compared to 2017 as declines in revenue were offset by declines in operating expenses.\nIn 2017, total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased when compared to 2016 due to an $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA matter.\nTotal Commissions and Direct Transaction Expenses\nIn 2018, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues slightly increased primarily from increases in investment commissions expense and signing bonus amortization, both of which are discussed in more detail below in the \"Segments Results\" section.\nIn 2017, total commissions and direct transaction expenses as a percent of revenues remained flat when compared to 2016.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits include salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll taxes and other employee related costs.

These decreases were partially offset by the changes in exchange rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar.\nTransaction and Operations Support\nTransaction and operations support primarily includes marketing, professional fees and other outside services, telecommunications, agent support costs, including forms related to our products, non-compensation employee costs, including training, travel and relocation costs, director stock-based compensation expense, bank charges and the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table is a summary of the change in transaction and operations support from the respective prior year for the years ended December 31:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year ended\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change resulting from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal expenses\n</td> <td>(50.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing costs\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank charges\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct monitor costs\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loss\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel and entertainment expenses\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and reorganization costs\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year ended\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, transaction and operations support decreased primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses driven by the lower accrual recorded in 2018 for the DPA matter and decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant and other costs due to ongoing cost-savings initiatives related to the Digital Transformation Program. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the provision for loss primarily driven by an increase in moneygram.com revenues, the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts and restructuring and reorganization costs.\nIn 2017, transaction and operations support increased primarily due to an increase in legal expenses driven by the $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA and costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial. Additional factors contributing to the increase include the change in net gains from foreign currency transactions and related forward contracts, direct monitor costs and bank charges from fees on foreign exchange trades. The increase was partially offset by decreases in outsourcing, independent contractor and consultant costs, marketing costs and a reduction in our provision for loss.\nOccupancy, Equipment and Supplies\nOccupancy, equipment and supplies expense include facilities rent and maintenance costs, software and equipment maintenance costs, freight and delivery costs and supplies.\nIn 2018, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense decreased by $4.1 million due to cost-savings from the Digital Transformation Program, reduced freight and delivery costs and a decrease in software maintenance costs.\nIn 2017, occupancy, equipment and supplies expense increased by $4.2 million as a result of an increase in equipment maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation on computer hardware and software, agent signage, point of sale equipment, capitalized software development costs, office furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.\nIn 2018, depreciation and amortization increased by $1.2 million because of accelerated depreciation from certain restructuring and other activities.\nIn 2017, depreciation and amortization decreased by $4.8 million as a result of higher costs during the first half of 2016 from the accelerated depreciation expense on our non-core point of sale equipment that was retired early.\nSegments Results\nGlobal Funds Transfer\nThe following table sets forth our Global Funds Transfer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money transfer revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,273.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,421.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,456.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(148.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bill payment revenue\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Global Funds Transfer revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,347.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,508.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,553.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(160.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee and other commissions and direct transaction expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMoney Transfer Fee and Other Revenue\nThe following table details the changes in money transfer fee and other revenue from the respective prior year for"}
