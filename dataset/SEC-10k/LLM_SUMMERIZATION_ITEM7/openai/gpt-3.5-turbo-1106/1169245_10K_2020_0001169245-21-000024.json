Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases. Our lead product candidate, bentracimab (also known as PB2452), is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, which we are developing for the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. Based on feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to seek approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. In our completed Phase 2a clinical trial of bentracimab, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor's antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours. Our second product candidate, pemziviptadil (also known as PB1046), is a once-weekly fusion protein currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Pemziviptadil utilizes our proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide, or ELP, technology, which also serves as an engine for our preclinical pipeline. We are also developing our preclinical product candidate, PB6440, for treatment-resistant hypertension. We retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates.\nAs we advance our clinical programs for bentracimab and pemziviptadil with site activations and patient enrollment, we remain in close contact with our clinical research organizations, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and current timelines and to consider whether we can implement appropriate mitigating measures to help lessen such impacts. At this time, however, we cannot fully forecast the scope of\nimpacts that COVID-19 may have on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results.\nWe are developing bentracimab pursuant to a co-development agreement, or the SFJ Agreement, with SFJ Pharmaceuticals X, Ltd., an SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company, or SFJ. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operations support in the European Union.\nIn March 2020, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial, a global, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in which we plan to enroll a total of 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. The primary endpoints for this trial are the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with intravenous infusion of bentracimab as measured by the VerifyNow\u00ae PRUTest\u00ae biomarker and achievement of clinical hemostasis in enrolled patients. We are currently enrolling patients in the United States, the European Union and Canada in this trial.\nThe FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab in April 2019. The European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, granted bentracimab Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation in February 2020. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for potential accelerated approval based on an interim analysis of the first approximately 100 patients treated in our REVERSE-IT trial, targeting that approximately one half of patients enrolled have uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and approximately one half require urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. After we submit our BLA with data from the first 100 patients, we intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA requirements. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA has also generally agreed with our proposed clinical development plan for bentracimab.\nWe have enrolled more than half of the first approximately 100 patients needed to support our BLA submission, nearly all of whom to date have required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. We are attempting to accelerate enrollment of patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, including by working to increase the number of enrolling clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, and the European Union as we believe that a broader site footprint will increase the probability of enrolling these patients. All of the first approximately 100 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial will be measured against the same VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker described above.\nWe expect to complete enrollment of the first 100 patients in the REVERSE-IT trial in mid-2021, and are targeting to submit our BLA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although those timelines could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2002, our operations have focused on developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary ELP technology, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities and our term loans with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and WestRiver Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P., or WestRiver.\nIn April 2019, we received $46.3 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock. In May 2019, we received an additional $2.5 million under our term loan with SVB and WestRiver, or our 2019 Loan, and in October 2019, we received an additional $5.0 million under our 2019 Loan. In January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement pursuant to which SFJ has agreed to provide us up to $120.0 million of funding to support the clinical development of bentracimab. As of December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million under the SFJ Agreement. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified clinical development milestones with respect to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022continue our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed;\n\u2022seek to expand our geographical reach through the SFJ Agreement and the corresponding clinical development support fees that we will incur;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH;\n\u2022develop PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension;\n\u2022seek to discover and develop additional clinical and preclinical product candidates;\n\u2022scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including bentracimab and pemziviptadil;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;\n\u2022add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and possible future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nRecent Development\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with BioVectra Inc. for the manufacture and supply of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval. Under the terms of the supply agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product per year, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab. Refer to \"Item 1. Business\" under the subheading Business - License, Co-Development and Other Agreements - BioVectra Supply Agreement in this annual report.\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nGrant Revenue\nGrant revenue is derived from government grants that support our efforts on specific research projects. We recognize grant revenue when there is reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and reasonable assurance that the grant revenue will be received.\nRevenue Under Collaborative Agreement\nRevenue under collaborative agreement is derived from an agreement with our collaboration partner, ImmunoForge Co., Ltd., or ImmunoForge. We have granted ImmunoForge a license to develop certain compound indications in exchange for an upfront license payment and event-based payments subject to ImmunoForge's achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are entitled to royalties if products under the collaboration are commercialized. We recognize revenue for upfront amounts when the license is transferred to ImmunoForge. Development milestones and other fees are recognized as revenue when it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. Sales-based milestones and royalties cannot be recognized until the underlying sales occur.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022manufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and potential commercial supply, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022clinical development support fees that we incur related to the SFJ Agreement;\n\u2022outsourced professional scientific development services;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;\n\u2022expenses relating to regulatory activities; and\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expense to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct our later-stage clinical trials for bentracimab and pemziviptadil, develop PB6440, conduct other preclinical studies and clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings and, if we receive regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, prepare for commercialization efforts.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from those candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022delays in regulators or institutional review boards authorizing us or our investigators to commence our clinical trials or in our ability to negotiate agreements with clinical trial sites or contract research organizations;\n\u2022our ability to secure adequate supply of product candidates for our trials;\n\u2022the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\u2022the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses patients receive;\n\u2022any side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results;\n\u2022the duration of patient follow-up; and\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expense includes professional fees for legal, accounting and tax-related services and insurance costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expense will increase as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and our future product candidates. We believe that these increases likely will include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nLoss From Remeasurement of Development Derivative Liability\nLoss from remeasurement of development derivative liability reflects the revaluation at each reporting date of our development derivative liability based on the present value of the estimated consideration to be received and the estimated consideration to be paid pursuant to the contractual terms under the SFJ Agreement, which is determined to be fair value. The liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter as a Level 3 derivative, with the change in fair value recorded in the condensed statements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense on our term loan with SVB and WestRiver.\nLicense, Co-Development and Other Agreements\nMedImmune Limited License Agreement\nIn November 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the MedImmune License, with MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc. Pursuant to the MedImmune License, MedImmune granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by MedImmune to develop and commercialize any products covered by the MedImmune License, or the MedImmune Licensed Products, for the treatment, palliation, diagnosis or prevention of any human disorder or condition. Under the MedImmune License, we paid MedImmune an upfront fee of $0.1 million. We are also required to pay MedImmune: quarterly fees relating to technical services provided by MedImmune; up to $18.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestone fees, $3.0 million of which had been incurred as of December 31, 2020; up to $50.0 million in commercial milestone fees; and mid-single digit to low-teen royalty percentages on net sales of MedImmune Licensed Products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. In addition, the MedImmune License offers an option for third-party product storage costs. From the inception of the MedImmune License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred costs of $3.6 million under the MedImmune License.\nCo-Development Agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals\nIn January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ provides us funding to support the global development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. In March 2020, we obtained the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, to grant SFJ a security interest in all of the assets owned or controlled by us that are necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of bentracimab. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. From the inception of the SFJ Agreement through December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified milestones with respect to our clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operational support in the European Union.\nUnder the terms of the SFJ Agreement, following the FDA approval of a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $325.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If the EMA or the national regulatory authority in certain European countries approve a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $205.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If either the PMDA of Japan or the NMPA of China approves a marketing application for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $1.0 million and then an additional $59.0 million in the aggregate in eight additional annual payments.\nWithin 120 days following approval of a BLA for bentracimab in one of the jurisdictions described above, we have the right, at our option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments for such jurisdiction (i.e., the U.S. Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments or Japan/China Approval Payments,\nas applicable) for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate. Within 120 days following a change of control of our company, we or our successor have the right, at its option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments in any of the jurisdictions in which a BLA for bentracimab was approved prior to the change of control for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate, provided that SFJ has not previously assigned the right to receive such payments to a third party (in which event we or our successor shall not have such right).\nIf following termination of the SFJ Agreement we continue to develop bentracimab and obtain BLA approval in the United States, the European Union, Japan or China, we will make the applicable approval payments for such jurisdiction to SFJ as if the SFJ Agreement had not been terminated, less any payments made upon termination, except that if we terminate the SFJ Agreement for SFJ's failure to make any payment to us when due, or SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement due to a material adverse event, as defined in the SFJ Agreement, then our obligation to make such approval payments would be reduced by 50%.\nDuke License Agreement\nIn October 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, which was most recently amended in April 2019, or the Duke License. Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Duke, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain know-how of Duke, to develop and commercialize any products covered by the Duke License, or Duke licensed products, relating to ELPs. Under the Duke License, we paid Duke an upfront fee of $37,000, additional fees in connection with amendments to the Duke License of $0.2 million and other additional licensing fees of $0.2 million. In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued Duke 24,493 shares of our common stock. Until we reached a certain stipulated equity milestone, which we reached in October 2007, we were obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to Duke from time to time so that its aggregate ownership represented 7.5% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We are also required to pay Duke: up to $2.2 million in regulatory and clinical milestone fees; up to $0.4 million in commercial milestone fees; low single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of Duke licensed products, with minimum aggregate royalty payments of $0.2 million payable following our achievement of certain commercial milestones; and up to the greater of $0.3 million or a low double-digit percentage of the fees we receive from a third party in consideration of forming a strategic alliance with respect to certain patent rights covered under the Duke License. We also must pay Duke the first $1.0 million of non-royalty payments we receive from a sublicensee, and thereafter a low double-digit percentage of any additional nonroyalty payments we receive, subject to certain conditions. From the inception of the Duke License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred royalty costs of $0.3 million under the Duke License. We are also required to apply for, prosecute and maintain all U.S. and foreign patent rights under the Duke License.\nWacker License Agreement\nIn April 2019, we entered into a license agreement, or the Wacker License Agreement, with Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, pursuant to which Wacker granted us an exclusive license under certain of Wacker's intellectual property rights to use Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain for the manufacture of bentracimab worldwide outside of specified Asian countries and to commercialize bentracimab, if approved, manufactured by us or on our behalf using Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain throughout the world. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license, subject to certain conditions as specified in the Wacker License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay a fixed, nominal per-unit royalty, which is subject to adjustment, and an annual license fee in a fixed Euro amount in the low to mid six digits. The agreement will be in force for an indefinite period of time, and upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, the license will be considered fully paid and will convert to a non-exclusive license. Either party may terminate the Wacker License Agreement for breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. From the inception of the Wacker License Agreement through December 31, 2020, we have incurred $0.5 million in costs.\nViamet Asset Purchase Agreement\nIn January 2020, we entered into the PB6440 Agreement with Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Selenity Therapeutics (Bermuda), Ltd., or the Sellers, pursuant to which we acquired all of the assets and intellectual property rights related to the Sellers' proprietary CYP11B2 inhibitor compound, formerly known as SE-6440 or VT-6440, and certain other CYP11B2 inhibitor compounds that are covered by the patent rights acquired by us under the PB6440 Agreement, or together, Compounds. Under the terms of the PB6440 Agreement, we paid the Sellers an upfront fee of $0.1 million upon the closing of the transaction, and we are required to pay the Sellers up to $5.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and intellectual property milestones with respect to certain product candidates that contain a Compound, up to $142.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to any approved product that contains a Compound and low- to mid-single digit royalty percentages on the net sales of approved products that contain a Compound,\nsubject to customary reductions and offsets in specified circumstances. We incurred $0.1 million in costs under the PB6440 Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBioVectra Supply Agreement\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement, or the BioVectra Agreement, with BioVectra Inc., or BioVectra, for the manufacture and supply by BioVectra of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval, if obtained. Under the terms of the BioVectra Agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product each year, and we have committed to purchase a specified minimum number of batches of product per year, or the Minimum Annual Commitment, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab.\nWe will pay a supply price per batch of product to be determined after the manufacturing process for the product is validated in accordance with the BioVectra Agreement, or Validation, plus the cost of certain consumables, raw materials, and third-party testing. Pursuant to the Minimum Annual Commitments, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of (i) approximately $14.0 million of batches of product in years 2022 through 2023, (ii) approximately $37.0 million of batches of product in 2024, and (iii) approximately $48.0 million of batches of product in each of years 2025 through 2031. In the event we do not purchase the applicable Minimum Annual Commitment in a given year, we will be obligated to make a payment to BioVectra in an amount equal to the then-applicable supply price per batch multiplied by the difference between the Minimum Annual Commitment for such year and the number of batches of product we actually purchased in such year, or the Minimum Shortfall Payment, except in the event that BioVectra was unable to deliver the number of batches ordered by us in such year. In the event of certain serious or extended failures by BioVectra to supply product in the quantities ordered by us in a given year, our Minimum Annual Commitment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be subject to reduction, and our obligation to make a Minimum Shortfall Payment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be waived. We will have the right to reduce the Minimum Annual Commitments for the year 2026 and subsequent years by up to a specified maximum percentage per year. Further, if we are only able to obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating bentracimab in only one of the U.S. or Europe, BioVectra and we have agreed to discuss in good faith an amendment to the BioVectra Agreement to reflect decreased requirements for product and impacts to the supply price to reflect lower volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,466) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue under collaborative agreement\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(575) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,041) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>72,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>13,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>85,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,079 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(84,856) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,736) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,120) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from remeasurement of development derivative liability </td> <td>(12,507) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,507) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,345) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1,445) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,076) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(369) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange gain (loss) </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (expense) income </td> <td>(13,709) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,198) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,565) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,247) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,318) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nGrant revenue was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower amounts available for grant reimbursement under our government grants during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have received all $2.8 million in funding available under the Small Business Innovation Research grants received from the National Institutes of Health to support the clinical development of pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH. Revenue under collaborative agreement was zero for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.6 million was related to revenue we received from our agreement with ImmunoForge, which was entered into in 2019.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $41.2 million was primarily attributable to increases in clinical and drug production activities related to bentracimab and pemziviptadil, personnel costs due to additional headcount and costs associated with our general research efforts.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expense by functional area for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical and clinical development\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and related benefits\n</td> <td>7,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facilities expense\n</td> <td>1,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expense by product candidate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External research and development expense by program </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bentracimab </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pemziviptadil </td> <td> </td> <td>12,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated research and development expense:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.9 million was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expense due to additional headcount, directors and officers liability insurance and professional services related to consulting and legal services.\nLoss From Remeasurement of Derivative Liability\nLoss from remeasurement of derivative liability was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The liability was initially recorded at the present value of the estimated consideration to be received and the estimated consideration to be paid pursuant to the contractual terms of the SFJ Agreement, which was determined to have been fair value. The derivative liability was subsequently remeasured at year end as a Level 3 derivative.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $1.3 million was attributable to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates during 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.4 million was attributable to increased borrowings in 2020 under the 2019 Loan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock and borrowings under our term loans. In future periods we expect SFJ to provide up to an additional $72.9 million of funding pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, $30.0 million of which we are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones with respect to our clinical development of bentracimab. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.1 million.\nIn March 2019, we entered into the 2019 Loan with SVB and WestRiver, pursuant to which we could borrow up to $15.0 million, issuable in three separate tranches. As of December 31, 2020, we had drawn on all three tranches under the 2019 Loan in the amounts of $7.5 million, $2.5 million and $5.0 million.\nIn April 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, which resulted in the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 4,124,475 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, generating net proceeds of $46.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nIn December 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement, which became effective in January 2020. The 2019 Shelf Registration Statement permits: (i) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $200.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination; and (ii) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $60.0 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold under an at-the-market\u201d sales agreement, or ATM Program, with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and William Blair & Company, L.L.C. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised gross proceeds of $2.9 million pursuant to the ATM Program from the sale of 561,848 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $5.41 per share. We have $197.1 million of common stock remaining that can be sold under the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement, of which $57.1 million may be sold under the ATM Program.\nIn January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ agreed to provide funding to support the development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. From the inception of the SFJ Agreement through December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specific clinical development milestones with respect to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,957) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,594) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,412) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(960) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>15,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45,903) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,974 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The use of cash primarily related to our net loss of $98.6 million, in addition to a $4.3 million change in our operating assets and liabilities. The use of cash was partially offset by non-cash expenses, primarily $27.0 million in research and development expenses paid for\non our behalf by SFJ, $12.5 million from the loss from remeasurement of development derivative liability and $2.2 million in stock-based compensation. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was principally due to an $8.4 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of drug manufacturing payments related to bentracimab, partially offset by increases of $1.9 million in accrued expenses and $1.0 million in accounts payable and by a $1.2 million decrease in other receivables due to timing of the receipt of grant revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $39.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The use of cash primarily related to our net loss of $39.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges primarily related to $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.5 million for non-cash interest expense and a $2.4 million change in our operating assets and liabilities. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was principally due to a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expense and other assets and an increase in other receivables of $1.0 million, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable, all as a result of increased clinical activities for our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of intellectual property rights during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to the receipt of $15.2 million under the SFJ Agreement and $2.9 million in proceeds from sales under the ATM Program, partially offset by $2.7 million in repayments of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities was $53.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the receipt of $46.3 million in net proceeds from the April 2019 underwritten public offering and borrowings of $8.1 million on the 2019 Loan, partially offset by $0.9 million for partial repayment of the SVB Loan.\nFunding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenues for at least the next several years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We cannot guarantee when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, in addition to the $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses that we expect SFJ will fund or reimburse, will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for 12 months from the date of the issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Risk Factors-\"The auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ if we do not remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the agreement and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected.\u201d We intend to devote our existing cash and cash equivalents to advance our clinical and preclinical development programs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of product candidates.\nWe plan to address our liquidity needs through the pursuit of additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings, or government or other third-party financing, marketing and distribution agreements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing agreements. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we will be required to make reductions in certain spending to extend our current funds. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of our development programs or clinical trials. We may also have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technology that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, if we fail to remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ. If our business related to bentracimab is transferred to SFJ, we will not share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab until SFJ has received a 300% return on its investment in bentracimab, after which we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the United States and certain European countries, and after SFJ has received an aggregate 500% return on its investment in bentracimab, we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the rest of the world. Any of these factors could harm our operating results and future prospects.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the progress and results of our ongoing and planned future clinical trials of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and our other preclinical programs;\n\u2022the timing and amount of payments we receive under the SFJ Agreement;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any future product candidates we may decide to pursue;\n\u2022the extent to which we develop, in-license or acquire other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022our ability to establish collaborations to commercialize pemziviptadil in the United States;\n\u2022our ability to establish collaborations to commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil or any of our other product candidates outside of the United States; and\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all.\nOur future commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the terms of these equity securities or this debt may restrict our ability to operate. Any future debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting and restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into profit-sharing or other arrangements or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or private grants, collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Further, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent\ndisruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting policies, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nSignificant estimates include assumptions we have used in the determination of accrued research and development costs. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. See Note 2 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nThe majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate expenses resulting from obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and research organizations, in connection with conducting clinical and preclinical activities. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. We reflect preclinical study and clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the preclinical study or clinical trial as measured by the timing of various aspects of the preclinical study or clinical trial, or related activities. Our accrual estimates are determined through review of the underlying contracts along with preparation of financial models taking into account discussions with research and other key personnel as to the progress of preclinical studies or clinical trials, or other services being conducted. During the course of a preclinical study or clinical trial, we will adjust the rate of expense recognition if actual results differ from our original estimates.\nDevelopment Derivative Liability\nIn January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ provides funding to support the global development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab.\nIf the FDA approves a BLA for bentracimab, we have agreed to pay to SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $325.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments, or the U.S. Approval Payments. If the EMA or the national regulatory authorities in certain European countries provide marketing approval of bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $205.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments, or the EU Approval Payments. The majority of the U.S. Approval Payments and the EU Approval Payments will be made from the third anniversary to the seventh anniversary of marketing approval in the applicable jurisdiction. If either the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or the PMDA, of Japan or the National Medical Products Administration, or the NMPA, of China provides marketing approval of bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $1.0 million and then an additional $59.0 million in the aggregate in eight additional annual payments, or the Japan/China Approval Payments, with the majority of the payments to be made from the fifth anniversary to the eighth anniversary of marketing approval. The Japan/China Approval Payments will only be paid once regardless of receipt of marketing approval in both Japan and China. The U.S. Approval\nPayments, EU Approval Payments and Japan/China Approval Payments will be proportionately adjusted in the event that the actual funding from SFJ is lower or greater than $120.0 million. We will not be obligated to make the U.S. Approval Payments if we do not receive marketing approval for bentracimab from the FDA, the EU Approval Payments if we do not receive marketing approval for bentracimab from the EMA or the national regulatory authority in certain European countries or the Japan/China Approval Payments if we do not receive marketing approval for bentracimab from either the PMDA or the NMPA.\nWe account for the SFJ Agreement as a derivative instrument that increases and decreases as consideration is received and repayments are made, respectively. The derivative is further adjusted at each reporting period to its estimated fair value. The derivative is valued using a scenario-based discounted cash flow method, whereby each scenario makes assumptions about the probability and timing of cash flows, and such cash flows are present valued using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The valuation method incorporates certain unobservable Level 3 key inputs including (i) the probability and timing of funding, (ii) the probability and timing of achieving regulatory approvals, (iii) our cost of borrowing (16.00% plus the risk free borrowing rate) and (iv) SFJ's cost of borrowing (2.50% plus the risk free borrowing rate). The derivative is presented as a liability in our balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded as a loss or gain from remeasurement of development derivative liability on the statements of operations.\nIf actual results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements.\nJOBS Act Transition Period\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we may rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) not providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) not complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) ending December 31, 2023, which is the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nWe are a smaller reporting company\u201d (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than what they might receive from other public reporting companies in which they hold equity interests.\nEffect of Inflation\nInflation did not have a significant impact on our net sales, revenues or income from continuing operations in 2020 or 2019.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases. Their lead product candidate is bentracimab, a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. The company is also developing pemziviptadil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension. The company has incurred significant operating losses and has funded its operations through equity and debt financing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases. Our lead product candidate, bentracimab (also known as PB2452), is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, which we are developing for the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. Based on feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to seek approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. In our completed Phase 2a clinical trial of bentracimab, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor's antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours. Our second product candidate, pemziviptadil (also known as PB1046), is a once-weekly fusion protein currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Pemziviptadil utilizes our proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide, or ELP, technology, which also serves as an engine for our preclinical pipeline. We are also developing our preclinical product candidate, PB6440, for treatment-resistant hypertension. We retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates.\nAs we advance our clinical programs for bentracimab and pemziviptadil with site activations and patient enrollment, we remain in close contact with our clinical research organizations, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and current timelines and to consider whether we can implement appropriate mitigating measures to help lessen such impacts. At this time, however, we cannot fully forecast the scope of\nimpacts that COVID-19 may have on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results.\nWe are developing bentracimab pursuant to a co-development agreement, or the SFJ Agreement, with SFJ Pharmaceuticals X, Ltd., an SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company, or SFJ. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operations support in the European Union.\nIn March 2020, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial, a global, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in which we plan to enroll a total of 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. The primary endpoints for this trial are the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with intravenous infusion of bentracimab as measured by the VerifyNow\u00ae PRUTest\u00ae biomarker and achievement of clinical hemostasis in enrolled patients. We are currently enrolling patients in the United States, the European Union and Canada in this trial.\nThe FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab in April 2019. The European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, granted bentracimab Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation in February 2020. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for potential accelerated approval based on an interim analysis of the first approximately 100 patients treated in our REVERSE-IT trial, targeting that approximately one half of patients enrolled have uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and approximately one half require urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. After we submit our BLA with data from the first 100 patients, we intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA requirements. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA has also generally agreed with our proposed clinical development plan for bentracimab.\nWe have enrolled more than half of the first approximately 100 patients needed to support our BLA submission, nearly all of whom to date have required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. We are attempting to accelerate enrollment of patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, including by working to increase the number of enrolling clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, and the European Union as we believe that a broader site footprint will increase the probability of enrolling these patients. All of the first approximately 100 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial will be measured against the same VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker described above.\nWe expect to complete enrollment of the first 100 patients in the REVERSE-IT trial in mid-2021, and are targeting to submit our BLA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although those timelines could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2002, our operations have focused on developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary ELP technology, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities and our term loans with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and WestRiver Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P., or WestRiver.\nIn April 2019, we received $46.3 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock. In May 2019, we received an additional $2.5 million under our term loan with SVB and WestRiver, or our 2019 Loan, and in October 2019, we received an additional $5.0 million under our 2019 Loan. In January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement pursuant to which SFJ has agreed to provide us up to $120.0 million of funding to support the clinical development of bentracimab. As of December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million under the SFJ Agreement. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified clinical development milestones with respect to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022continue our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed;\n\u2022seek to expand our geographical reach through the SFJ Agreement and the corresponding clinical development support fees that we will incur;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH;\n\u2022develop PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension;\n\u2022seek to discover and develop additional clinical and preclinical product candidates;\n\u2022scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including bentracimab and pemziviptadil;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;\n\u2022add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and possible future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nRecent Development\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with BioVectra Inc. for the manufacture and supply of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval. Under the terms of the supply agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product per year, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab. Refer to \"Item 1. Business\" under the subheading Business - License, Co-Development and Other Agreements - BioVectra Supply Agreement in this annual report.\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nGrant Revenue\nGrant revenue is derived from government grants that support our efforts on specific research projects. We recognize grant revenue when there is reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and reasonable assurance that the grant revenue will be received.\nRevenue Under Collaborative Agreement\nRevenue under collaborative agreement is derived from an agreement with our collaboration partner, ImmunoForge Co., Ltd., or ImmunoForge. We have granted ImmunoForge a license to develop certain compound indications in exchange for an upfront license payment and event-based payments subject to ImmunoForge's achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are entitled to royalties if products under the collaboration are commercialized. We recognize revenue for upfront amounts when the license is transferred to ImmunoForge. Development milestones and other fees are recognized as revenue when it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. Sales-based milestones and royalties cannot be recognized until the underlying sales occur.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022manufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and potential commercial supply, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022clinical development support fees that we incur related to the SFJ Agreement;\n\u2022outsourced professional scientific development services;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;\n\u2022expenses relating to regulatory activities; and\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expense to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct our later-stage clinical trials for bentracimab and pemziviptadil, develop PB6440, conduct other preclinical studies and clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings and, if we receive regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, prepare for commercialization efforts.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from those candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022delays in regulators or institutional review boards authorizing us or our investigators to commence our clinical trials or in our ability to negotiate agreements with clinical trial sites or contract research organizations;\n\u2022our ability to secure adequate supply of product candidates for our trials;\n\u2022the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\u2022the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses patients receive;\n\u2022any side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results;\n\u2022the duration of patient follow-up; and\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expense includes professional fees for legal, accounting and tax-related services and insurance costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expense will increase as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and our future product candidates. We believe that these increases likely will include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nLoss From Remeasurement of Development Derivative Liability\nLoss from remeasurement of development derivative liability reflects the revaluation at each reporting date of our development derivative liability based on the present value of the estimated consideration to be received and the estimated consideration to be paid pursuant to the contractual terms under the SFJ Agreement, which is determined to be fair value. The liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter as a Level 3 derivative, with the change in fair value recorded in the condensed statements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense on our term loan with SVB and WestRiver.\nLicense, Co-Development and Other Agreements\nMedImmune Limited License Agreement\nIn November 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the MedImmune License, with MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc. Pursuant to the MedImmune License, MedImmune granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by MedImmune to develop and commercialize any products covered by the MedImmune License, or the MedImmune Licensed Products, for the treatment, palliation, diagnosis or prevention of any human disorder or condition. Under the MedImmune License, we paid MedImmune an upfront fee of $0.1 million. We are also required to pay MedImmune: quarterly fees relating to technical services provided by MedImmune; up to $18.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestone fees, $3.0 million of which had been incurred as of December 31, 2020; up to $50.0 million in commercial milestone fees; and mid-single digit to low-teen royalty percentages on net sales of MedImmune Licensed Products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. In addition, the MedImmune License offers an option for third-party product storage costs. From the inception of the MedImmune License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred costs of $3.6 million under the MedImmune License.\nCo-Development Agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals\nIn January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ provides us funding to support the global development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. In March 2020, we obtained the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, to grant SFJ a security interest in all of the assets owned or controlled by us that are necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of bentracimab. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. From the inception of the SFJ Agreement through December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified milestones with respect to our clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operational support in the European Union.\nUnder the terms of the SFJ Agreement, following the FDA approval of a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $325.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If the EMA or the national regulatory authority in certain European countries approve a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $205.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If either the PMDA of Japan or the NMPA of China approves a marketing application for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $1.0 million and then an additional $59.0 million in the aggregate in eight additional annual payments.\nWithin 120 days following approval of a BLA for bentracimab in one of the jurisdictions described above, we have the right, at our option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments for such jurisdiction (i.e., the U.S. Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments or Japan/China Approval Payments,\nas applicable) for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate. Within 120 days following a change of control of our company, we or our successor have the right, at its option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments in any of the jurisdictions in which a BLA for bentracimab was approved prior to the change of control for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate, provided that SFJ has not previously assigned the right to receive such payments to a third party (in which event we or our successor shall not have such right).\nIf following termination of the SFJ Agreement we continue to develop bentracimab and obtain BLA approval in the United States, the European Union, Japan or China, we will make the applicable approval payments for such jurisdiction to SFJ as if the SFJ Agreement had not been terminated, less any payments made upon termination, except that if we terminate the SFJ Agreement for SFJ's failure to make any payment to us when due, or SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement due to a material adverse event, as defined in the SFJ Agreement, then our obligation to make such approval payments would be reduced by 50%.\nDuke License Agreement\nIn October 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, which was most recently amended in April 2019, or the Duke License. Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Duke, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain know-how of Duke, to develop and commercialize any products covered by the Duke License, or Duke licensed products, relating to ELPs. Under the Duke License, we paid Duke an upfront fee of $37,000, additional fees in connection with amendments to the Duke License of $0.2 million and other additional licensing fees of $0.2 million. In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued Duke 24,493 shares of our common stock. Until we reached a certain stipulated equity milestone, which we reached in October 2007, we were obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to Duke from time to time so that its aggregate ownership represented 7.5% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We are also required to pay Duke: up to $2.2 million in regulatory and clinical milestone fees; up to $0.4 million in commercial milestone fees; low single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of Duke licensed products, with minimum aggregate royalty payments of $0.2 million payable following our achievement of certain commercial milestones; and up to the greater of $0.3 million or a low double-digit percentage of the fees we receive from a third party in consideration of forming a strategic alliance with respect to certain patent rights covered under the Duke License. We also must pay Duke the first $1.0 million of non-royalty payments we receive from a sublicensee, and thereafter a low double-digit percentage of any additional nonroyalty payments we receive, subject to certain conditions. From the inception of the Duke License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred royalty costs of $0.3 million under the Duke License. We are also required to apply for, prosecute and maintain all U.S. and foreign patent rights under the Duke License.\nWacker License Agreement\nIn April 2019, we entered into a license agreement, or the Wacker License Agreement, with Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, pursuant to which Wacker granted us an exclusive license under certain of Wacker's intellectual property rights to use Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain for the manufacture of bentracimab worldwide outside of specified Asian countries and to commercialize bentracimab, if approved, manufactured by us or on our behalf using Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain throughout the world. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license, subject to certain conditions as specified in the Wacker License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay a fixed, nominal per-unit royalty, which is subject to adjustment, and an annual license fee in a fixed Euro amount in the low to mid six digits. The agreement will be in force for an indefinite period of time, and upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, the license will be considered fully paid and will convert to a non-exclusive license. Either party may terminate the Wacker License Agreement for breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. From the inception of the Wacker License Agreement through December 31, 2020, we have incurred $0.5 million in costs.\nViamet Asset Purchase Agreement\nIn January 2020, we entered into the PB6440 Agreement with Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Selenity Therapeutics (Bermuda), Ltd., or the Sellers, pursuant to which we acquired all of the assets and intellectual property rights related to the Sellers' proprietary CYP11B2 inhibitor compound, formerly known as SE-6440 or VT-6440, and certain other CYP11B2 inhibitor compounds that are covered by the patent rights acquired by us under the PB6440 Agreement, or together, Compounds. Under the terms of the PB6440 Agreement, we paid the Sellers an upfront fee of $0.1 million upon the closing of the transaction, and we are required to pay the Sellers up to $5.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and intellectual property milestones with respect to certain product candidates that contain a Compound, up to $142.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to any approved product that contains a Compound and low- to mid-single digit royalty percentages on the net sales of approved products that contain a Compound,\nsubject to customary reductions and offsets in specified circumstances. We incurred $0.1 million in costs under the PB6440 Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBioVectra Supply Agreement\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement, or the BioVectra Agreement, with BioVectra Inc., or BioVectra, for the manufacture and supply by BioVectra of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval, if obtained. Under the terms of the BioVectra Agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product each year, and we have committed to purchase a specified minimum number of batches of product per year, or the Minimum Annual Commitment, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab.\nWe will pay a supply price per batch of product to be determined after the manufacturing process for the product is validated in accordance with the BioVectra Agreement, or Validation, plus the cost of certain consumables, raw materials, and third-party testing. Pursuant to the Minimum Annual Commitments, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of (i) approximately $14.0 million of batches of product in years 2022 through 2023, (ii) approximately $37.0 million of batches of product in 2024, and (iii) approximately $48.0 million of batches of product in each of years 2025 through 2031. In the event we do not purchase the applicable Minimum Annual Commitment in a given year, we will be obligated to make a payment to BioVectra in an amount equal to the then-applicable supply price per batch multiplied by the difference between the Minimum Annual Commitment for such year and the number of batches of product we actually purchased in such year, or the Minimum Shortfall Payment, except in the event that BioVectra was unable to deliver the number of batches ordered by us in such year. In the event of certain serious or extended failures by BioVectra to supply product in the quantities ordered by us in a given year, our Minimum Annual Commitment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be subject to reduction, and our obligation to make a Minimum Shortfall Payment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be waived. We will have the right to reduce the Minimum Annual Commitments for the year 2026 and subsequent years by up to a specified maximum percentage per year. Further, if we are only able to obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating bentracimab in only one of the U.S. or Europe, BioVectra and we have agreed to discuss in good faith an amendment to the BioVectra Agreement to reflect decreased requirements for product and impacts to the supply price to reflect lower volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nGrant revenue was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower amounts available for grant reimbursement under our government grants during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have received all $2.8 million in funding available under the Small Business Innovation Research grants received from the National Institutes of Health to support the clinical development of pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH. Revenue under collaborative agreement was zero for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.6 million was related to revenue we received from our agreement with ImmunoForge, which was entered into in 2019.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $41.2 million was primarily attributable to increases in clinical and drug production activities related to bentracimab and pemziviptadil, personnel costs due to additional headcount and costs associated with our general research efforts.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases. Our lead product candidate, bentracimab (also known as PB2452), is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, which we are developing for the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. Based on feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to seek approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. In our completed Phase 2a clinical trial of bentracimab, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor's antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours. Our second product candidate, pemziviptadil (also known as PB1046), is a once-weekly fusion protein currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Pemziviptadil utilizes our proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide, or ELP, technology, which also serves as an engine for our preclinical pipeline. We are also developing our preclinical product candidate, PB6440, for treatment-resistant hypertension. We retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates.\nAs we advance our clinical programs for bentracimab and pemziviptadil with site activations and patient enrollment, we remain in close contact with our clinical research organizations, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and current timelines and to consider whether we can implement appropriate mitigating measures to help lessen such impacts. At this time, however, we cannot fully forecast the scope of\nimpacts that COVID-19 may have on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results.\nWe are developing bentracimab pursuant to a co-development agreement, or the SFJ Agreement, with SFJ Pharmaceuticals X, Ltd., an SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company, or SFJ. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operations support in the European Union.\nIn March 2020, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial, a global, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in which we plan to enroll a total of 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. The primary endpoints for this trial are the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with intravenous infusion of bentracimab as measured by the VerifyNow\u00ae PRUTest\u00ae biomarker and achievement of clinical hemostasis in enrolled patients. We are currently enrolling patients in the United States, the European Union and Canada in this trial.\nThe FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab in April 2019. The European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, granted bentracimab Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation in February 2020. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for potential accelerated approval based on an interim analysis of the first approximately 100 patients treated in our REVERSE-IT trial, targeting that approximately one half of patients enrolled have uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and approximately one half require urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. After we submit our BLA with data from the first 100 patients, we intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA requirements. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA has also generally agreed with our proposed clinical development plan for bentracimab.\nWe have enrolled more than half of the first approximately 100 patients needed to support our BLA submission, nearly all of whom to date have required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. We are attempting to accelerate enrollment of patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, including by working to increase the number of enrolling clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, and the European Union as we believe that a broader site footprint will increase the probability of enrolling these patients. All of the first approximately 100 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial will be measured against the same VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker described above.\nWe expect to complete enrollment of the first 100 patients in the REVERSE-IT trial in mid-2021, and are targeting to submit our BLA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although those timelines could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2002, our operations have focused on developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary ELP technology, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities and our term loans with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and WestRiver Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P., or WestRiver.\nIn April 2019, we received $46.3 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock. In May 2019, we received an additional $2.5 million under our term loan with SVB and WestRiver, or our 2019 Loan, and in October 2019, we received an additional $5.0 million under our 2019 Loan. In January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement pursuant to which SFJ has agreed to provide us up to $120.0 million of funding to support the clinical development of bentracimab. As of December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million under the SFJ Agreement. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified clinical development milestones with respect to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022continue our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed;\n\u2022seek to expand our geographical reach through the SFJ Agreement and the corresponding clinical development support fees that we will incur;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH;\n\u2022develop PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension;\n\u2022seek to discover and develop additional clinical and preclinical product candidates;\n\u2022scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including bentracimab and pemziviptadil;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;\n\u2022add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and possible future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nRecent Development\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with BioVectra Inc. for the manufacture and supply of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval. Under the terms of the supply agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product per year, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab. Refer to \"Item 1. Business\" under the subheading Business - License, Co-Development and Other Agreements - BioVectra Supply Agreement in this annual report.\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nGrant Revenue\nGrant revenue is derived from government grants that support our efforts on specific research projects. We recognize grant revenue when there is reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and reasonable assurance that the grant revenue will be received.\nRevenue Under Collaborative Agreement\nRevenue under collaborative agreement is derived from an agreement with our collaboration partner, ImmunoForge Co., Ltd., or ImmunoForge. We have granted ImmunoForge a license to develop certain compound indications in exchange for an upfront license payment and event-based payments subject to ImmunoForge's achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are entitled to royalties if products under the collaboration are commercialized. We recognize revenue for upfront amounts when the license is transferred to ImmunoForge. Development milestones and other fees are recognized as revenue when it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. Sales-based milestones and royalties cannot be recognized until the underlying sales occur.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022manufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and potential commercial supply, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022clinical development support fees that we incur related to the SFJ Agreement;\n\u2022outsourced professional scientific development services;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;\n\u2022expenses relating to regulatory activities; and\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expense to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct our later-stage clinical trials for bentracimab and pemziviptadil, develop PB6440, conduct other preclinical studies and clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings and, if we receive regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, prepare for commercialization efforts.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from those candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022delays in regulators or institutional review boards authorizing us or our investigators to commence our clinical trials or in our ability to negotiate agreements with clinical trial sites or contract research organizations;\n\u2022our ability to secure adequate supply of product candidates for our trials;\n\u2022the number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\u2022the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses patients receive;\n\u2022any side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results;\n\u2022the duration of patient follow-up; and\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expense includes professional fees for legal, accounting and tax-related services and insurance costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expense will increase as we continue to operate as a public reporting company and continue to develop bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and our future product candidates. We believe that these increases likely will include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public reporting companies.\nLoss From Remeasurement of Development Derivative Liability\nLoss from remeasurement of development derivative liability reflects the revaluation at each reporting date of our development derivative liability based on the present value of the estimated consideration to be received and the estimated consideration to be paid pursuant to the contractual terms under the SFJ Agreement, which is determined to be fair value. The liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter as a Level 3 derivative, with the change in fair value recorded in the condensed statements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense on our term loan with SVB and WestRiver.\nLicense, Co-Development and Other Agreements\nMedImmune Limited License Agreement\nIn November 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the MedImmune License, with MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc. Pursuant to the MedImmune License, MedImmune granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by MedImmune to develop and commercialize any products covered by the MedImmune License, or the MedImmune Licensed Products, for the treatment, palliation, diagnosis or prevention of any human disorder or condition. Under the MedImmune License, we paid MedImmune an upfront fee of $0.1 million. We are also required to pay MedImmune: quarterly fees relating to technical services provided by MedImmune; up to $18.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestone fees, $3.0 million of which had been incurred as of December 31, 2020; up to $50.0 million in commercial milestone fees; and mid-single digit to low-teen royalty percentages on net sales of MedImmune Licensed Products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. In addition, the MedImmune License offers an option for third-party product storage costs. From the inception of the MedImmune License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred costs of $3.6 million under the MedImmune License.\nCo-Development Agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals\nIn January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ provides us funding to support the global development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. In March 2020, we obtained the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, to grant SFJ a security interest in all of the assets owned or controlled by us that are necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of bentracimab. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. From the inception of the SFJ Agreement through December 31, 2020, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $47.1 million. In addition, we expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. SFJ will also provide up to an additional $30.0 million of funding upon the achievement of specified milestones with respect to our clinical development of bentracimab. During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operational support in the European Union.\nUnder the terms of the SFJ Agreement, following the FDA approval of a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $325.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If the EMA or the national regulatory authority in certain European countries approve a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $205.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If either the PMDA of Japan or the NMPA of China approves a marketing application for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $1.0 million and then an additional $59.0 million in the aggregate in eight additional annual payments.\nWithin 120 days following approval of a BLA for bentracimab in one of the jurisdictions described above, we have the right, at our option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments for such jurisdiction (i.e., the U.S. Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments or Japan/China Approval Payments,\nas applicable) for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate. Within 120 days following a change of control of our company, we or our successor have the right, at its option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments in any of the jurisdictions in which a BLA for bentracimab was approved prior to the change of control for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate, provided that SFJ has not previously assigned the right to receive such payments to a third party (in which event we or our successor shall not have such right).\nIf following termination of the SFJ Agreement we continue to develop bentracimab and obtain BLA approval in the United States, the European Union, Japan or China, we will make the applicable approval payments for such jurisdiction to SFJ as if the SFJ Agreement had not been terminated, less any payments made upon termination, except that if we terminate the SFJ Agreement for SFJ's failure to make any payment to us when due, or SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement due to a material adverse event, as defined in the SFJ Agreement, then our obligation to make such approval payments would be reduced by 50%.\nDuke License Agreement\nIn October 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, which was most recently amended in April 2019, or the Duke License. Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Duke, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain know-how of Duke, to develop and commercialize any products covered by the Duke License, or Duke licensed products, relating to ELPs. Under the Duke License, we paid Duke an upfront fee of $37,000, additional fees in connection with amendments to the Duke License of $0.2 million and other additional licensing fees of $0.2 million. In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued Duke 24,493 shares of our common stock. Until we reached a certain stipulated equity milestone, which we reached in October 2007, we were obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to Duke from time to time so that its aggregate ownership represented 7.5% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We are also required to pay Duke: up to $2.2 million in regulatory and clinical milestone fees; up to $0.4 million in commercial milestone fees; low single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of Duke licensed products, with minimum aggregate royalty payments of $0.2 million payable following our achievement of certain commercial milestones; and up to the greater of $0.3 million or a low double-digit percentage of the fees we receive from a third party in consideration of forming a strategic alliance with respect to certain patent rights covered under the Duke License. We also must pay Duke the first $1.0 million of non-royalty payments we receive from a sublicensee, and thereafter a low double-digit percentage of any additional nonroyalty payments we receive, subject to certain conditions. From the inception of the Duke License through December 31, 2020, we have incurred royalty costs of $0.3 million under the Duke License. We are also required to apply for, prosecute and maintain all U.S. and foreign patent rights under the Duke License.\nWacker License Agreement\nIn April 2019, we entered into a license agreement, or the Wacker License Agreement, with Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, pursuant to which Wacker granted us an exclusive license under certain of Wacker's intellectual property rights to use Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain for the manufacture of bentracimab worldwide outside of specified Asian countries and to commercialize bentracimab, if approved, manufactured by us or on our behalf using Wacker's proprietary E. coli strain throughout the world. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license, subject to certain conditions as specified in the Wacker License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay a fixed, nominal per-unit royalty, which is subject to adjustment, and an annual license fee in a fixed Euro amount in the low to mid six digits. The agreement will be in force for an indefinite period of time, and upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, the license will be considered fully paid and will convert to a non-exclusive license. Either party may terminate the Wacker License Agreement for breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. From the inception of the Wacker License Agreement through December 31, 2020, we have incurred $0.5 million in costs.\nViamet Asset Purchase Agreement\nIn January 2020, we entered into the PB6440 Agreement with Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Selenity Therapeutics (Bermuda), Ltd., or the Sellers, pursuant to which we acquired all of the assets and intellectual property rights related to the Sellers' proprietary CYP11B2 inhibitor compound, formerly known as SE-6440 or VT-6440, and certain other CYP11B2 inhibitor compounds that are covered by the patent rights acquired by us under the PB6440 Agreement, or together, Compounds. Under the terms of the PB6440 Agreement, we paid the Sellers an upfront fee of $0.1 million upon the closing of the transaction, and we are required to pay the Sellers up to $5.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and intellectual property milestones with respect to certain product candidates that contain a Compound, up to $142.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to any approved product that contains a Compound and low- to mid-single digit royalty percentages on the net sales of approved products that contain a Compound,\nsubject to customary reductions and offsets in specified circumstances. We incurred $0.1 million in costs under the PB6440 Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBioVectra Supply Agreement\nIn March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement, or the BioVectra Agreement, with BioVectra Inc., or BioVectra, for the manufacture and supply by BioVectra of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval, if obtained. Under the terms of the BioVectra Agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product each year, and we have committed to purchase a specified minimum number of batches of product per year, or the Minimum Annual Commitment, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab.\nWe will pay a supply price per batch of product to be determined after the manufacturing process for the product is validated in accordance with the BioVectra Agreement, or Validation, plus the cost of certain consumables, raw materials, and third-party testing. Pursuant to the Minimum Annual Commitments, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of (i) approximately $14.0 million of batches of product in years 2022 through 2023, (ii) approximately $37.0 million of batches of product in 2024, and (iii) approximately $48.0 million of batches of product in each of years 2025 through 2031. In the event we do not purchase the applicable Minimum Annual Commitment in a given year, we will be obligated to make a payment to BioVectra in an amount equal to the then-applicable supply price per batch multiplied by the difference between the Minimum Annual Commitment for such year and the number of batches of product we actually purchased in such year, or the Minimum Shortfall Payment, except in the event that BioVectra was unable to deliver the number of batches ordered by us in such year. In the event of certain serious or extended failures by BioVectra to supply product in the quantities ordered by us in a given year, our Minimum Annual Commitment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be subject to reduction, and our obligation to make a Minimum Shortfall Payment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be waived. We will have the right to reduce the Minimum Annual Commitments for the year 2026 and subsequent years by up to a specified maximum percentage per year. Further, if we are only able to obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating bentracimab in only one of the U.S. or Europe, BioVectra and we have agreed to discuss in good faith an amendment to the BioVectra Agreement to reflect decreased requirements for product and impacts to the supply price to reflect lower volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,466) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue under collaborative agreement\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(575) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,041) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>72,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>13,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>85,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,079 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(84,856) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,736) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,120) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from remeasurement of development derivative liability </td> <td>(12,507) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,507) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,345) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1,445) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,076) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(369) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange gain (loss) </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (expense) income </td> <td>(13,709) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,198) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,565) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,247) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(59,318) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nGrant revenue was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower amounts available for grant reimbursement under our government grants during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have received all $2.8 million in funding available under the Small Business Innovation Research grants received from the National Institutes of Health to support the clinical development of pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH. Revenue under collaborative agreement was zero for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.6 million was related to revenue we received from our agreement with ImmunoForge, which was entered into in 2019.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $41.2 million was primarily attributable to increases in clinical and drug production activities related to bentracimab and pemziviptadil, personnel costs due to additional headcount and costs associated with our general research efforts.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development"}
