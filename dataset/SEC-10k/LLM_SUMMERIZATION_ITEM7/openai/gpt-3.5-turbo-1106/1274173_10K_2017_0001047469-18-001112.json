MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF JHG\nBusiness Overview\nJHG is an independent global asset manager, specializing in active investment across all major asset classes. JHG actively manages a broad range of investment products for institutional and retail investors across five capabilities: Equities, Quantitative Equities, Fixed Income, Multi-Asset and Alternatives.\nOn the Closing Date, JCG and Henderson completed a merger of equals. As a result of the Merger, JCG and its consolidated subsidiaries became subsidiaries of Henderson, which was renamed to Janus Henderson Group plc. For purposes of this section, each reference to the \"Group\" or \"JHG\" refers to Janus Henderson Group plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nSegment Considerations\nJHG is a global asset manager and manages a range of investment products, operating across various product lines, distribution channels and geographic regions. However, information is reported to the chief operating decision-makers, the Co-Chief Executive Officers (\"Co-CEOs\"), on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by the Co-CEOs and, on this basis, the Group operates as a single segment investment management business.\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of management fees and performance fees. Management fees are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of AUM and are calculated using either the daily, month-end or quarter-end average asset balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Accordingly, fluctuations in the financial markets have a direct effect on the Group's operating results. Additionally, AUM may outperform or underperform the financial markets and therefore may fluctuate in varying degrees from that of the general market.\nPerformance fees are specified in certain fund and client contracts and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an established index over a specified period of time. This is often subject to a hurdle rate. Performance fees are recognized at the end of the contractual period (typically monthly, quarterly or annually) if the stated performance criteria are achieved. Certain fund and client contracts allow for negative performance fees where there is underperformance against the relevant index.\n2017 SUMMARY\n2017 Highlights\n\u2022 Completion of the Merger with JCG on May 30, 2017. Integration efforts are ahead of expectations, setting the foundations for future growth.\n\u2022 Improvements to investment performance and minimal disruption to clients and investment teams.\n\u2022 Increase of AUM to $370.8 billion, up 16% from December 31, 2016 on a pro forma basis.\n\u2022 Strong revenue and profitability growth with significant improvement in operating margin. 2017 diluted earnings per share of $3.93, or $2.48 on a pro forma adjusted basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for information on adjusted non-GAAP figures.\n\u2022 Forecasted cost synergies of $110 million at time of merger have since been raised to $125 million, with approximately $90 million in annualized run rate cost synergies realized as of December 31, 2017.\n\u2022 Announcement of expansion into the U.S. of our long-standing strategic partnership with BNP Paribas Securities Services (\"BNP Paribas\"), supporting the Group's global operating model.\nFinancial Summary\nResults are reported on a GAAP basis. Adjusted non-GAAP figures are presented in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,743.7 million, an increase of $743.8 million, or 74%, from December 31, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by legacy JCG revenues of $680.8 million in 2017. Average AUM (excluding JCG) increased by 6% and positively affected management fees during 2017, compared to 2016. Performance fees improved in 2017 by $55.4 million compared to 2016, which contributed to the increase in revenue. These increases are partially offset by lower average management fee margins and adverse foreign currency translation.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,301.4 million, an increase of $533.6 million, or 69%, compared to operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legacy JCG operations contributed $405.0 million to operating expenses in 2017 and total deal and integration costs in 2017 contributed $126.2 million.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $442.3 million, an increase of $210.2 million, or 91%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Group's operating margin was 25.4% in 2017, compared to 23.2% in 2016. Legacy JCG operations contributed $275.8 million to operating income in the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase of $110.5 million of deal and integration costs related to the Merger and a reduction in expenditures year-over-year as the Group concentrated on integration.\nNet income attributable to JHG in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $655.5 million, an increase of $466.5 million, or 247%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Group recorded a one-time tax benefit of $340.7 million due to changes in U.S. tax laws. Legacy JCG operations contributed $173.1 million to net income attributable to JHG in 2017. Performance fees improved in 2017 and contributed $55.4 million to the year-over-year change. These increases were partially offset by deal and integration costs related to the Merger.\nInvestment Performance of Assets Under Management\nThe following table is a summary of investment performance as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Percentage of assets under management outperforming benchmark (1)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuantitative Equities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n90 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-Asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAlternatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n93 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes JCG performance.\nAssets Under Management\nThe Group's AUM as of December 31, 2017, was $370.8 billion, an increase of $246.1 billion, or 197% from December 31, 2016, driven primarily by net acquisitions of $205.8 billion representing JCG's AUM of $206.5 billion, offset by disposals of $0.7 billion. Positive market movements in the period contributed $31.7 billion and the weakening of the USD resulted in favorable foreign exchange movements of $11.6 billion. This was partially offset by net outflows of $3.0 billion, which includes flows from JCG from the Closing Date.\nDuring 2017, the USD weakened against all major currencies. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of the Group's AUM was non-USD denominated, resulting in a favorable currency effect, particularly in products exposed to GBP.\nJHG's ETNs are not included within the AUM as JHG is not the named adviser or subadviser to ETNs. ETN assets totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset and flows by capability for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (includes JCG activity from the Closing Date), are as

securities of the funds, trusts and segregated mandates. A significant proportion of these securities are listed or quoted on a recognized securities exchange or market and are regularly traded thereon; these investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted market prices. Investments including, but not limited to, over-the-counter derivative contracts, (which are dealt in or through a clearing firm), exchange or financial institution will be valued by reference to the most recent official settlement price quoted by the appointed market vendor and in the event no price is available from this source,\na broker quotation may be used. Physical property held is valued monthly by a specialist independent appraiser.\nWhen a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The Fair Value Pricing Committee is responsible for determining or approving these unquoted prices, which are reported to those charged with governance of the funds and trusts. For funds that invest in markets that are closed at their valuation point, an assessment is made daily to determine whether a fair value pricing adjustment is required to the fund's valuation. This may be due to significant market movements in other correlated open markets, scheduled market closures or unscheduled market closures as a result of natural disaster or government intervention.\nFor legacy Henderson funds, third-party administrators hold a key role in the collection and validation of prices used in the valuation of the securities. Daily price validation is completed using techniques such as day-on-day tolerance movements, invariant prices, excessive movement checks and intra-vendor tolerance checks. The JHG Data Management Team performs oversight of this process and completes annual due diligence on the processes of third parties.\nFor legacy JCG funds, the Group performs a number of procedures to validate the pricing received from third-party providers. For actively traded equity securities, prices are received daily from both a primary and secondary vendor. For fixed income securities, prices are received daily from a primary vendor and weekly from a secondary vendor. Prices from the primary and secondary vendors are compared to identify any discrepancies. In the event of a discrepancy, a price challenge may be issued to both vendors. Securities with significant day to day price changes require additional research, which may include a review of all news pertaining to the issue and issuer and any corporate actions. All fixed income prices are reviewed by JHG's fixed income trading desk to incorporate market activity information available to JHG's traders. In the event the traders have received price indications from market makers for a particular issue, this information is transmitted to the pricing vendors.\nJHG leverages the expertise of its fund management teams across the business to cross-invest assets and create value for its clients. Where cross investment occurs, assets and flows are identified and the duplication is removed.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 vs.\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 vs.\n2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,465.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>867.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>914.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPerformance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n103.9 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.6 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shareowner servicing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n103.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.5 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,743.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>999.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,155.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (13.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*n/m - Not meaningful\nManagement fees\nManagement fees increased by $597.3 million, or 68.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 with the inclusion of seven months of legacy JCG management fees of $584.9 million as the largest driver. Average AUM (excluding JCG) increased by 6% and positively affected management fees during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. Positive market movements contributed $80.2 million to the increase in management fees over the year. These increases are partially offset by the effect of adverse foreign currency translations ($11.0) million, net outflows causing a decrease in management fees ($50.3) million, and lower average gross fee margins. Lower margins are primarily from a change in product mix (i.e., switch in share classes as a result of the Retail Distribution Review within Europe to a lower fee share class), and are partially offset by a decrease in distribution expenses.\nManagement fees decreased by $46.9 million, or (5.1%), from 2015 to 2016, despite average AUM increasing by 1.3% year-over-year. Although average institutional AUM increased by 6.1%, average retail AUM decreased by 1.5% resulting in a mix shift from higher margin retail fees to lower margin institutional fees. In addition, management fee margins decreased due to the share class change as explained above. As a result, distribution costs also fell during the period.\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations, markets and 2016 outflows caused a net decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by a net favorable full year impact of 2015 inflows and the full year favorable impact of acquisitions.\nPerformance fees\nPerformance fees are derived across a number of product ranges. Pooled fund and segregated mandate performance fees are recognized on a quarterly or annual basis, while mutual fund performance fees are recognized on a monthly basis.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in SICAV performance fees. Performance fees for UK OEICs and Unit Trusts also increased in the period. These increases are partially offset by $6.3 million of net negative performance fees related to legacy JCG.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $96.0 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower SICAV fees which for long-only funds typically only pay out a performance fee if relative and absolute performance is positive. Offshore Absolute Return fees decreased by 64.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower performance fees on pooled hedge funds.\nThe following table outlines performance fees by product type and includes information on fees earned, number of funds generating performance fees, AUM generating performance fees, number of funds eligible to earn performance fees, AUM with an un-crystalized performance fee, performance fee participation rate, performance fee frequency and performance fee methodology (dollars in millions, except where noted):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>UK OEICs &\nUnit Trusts </th> <th> </th> <th>SICAVs </th> <th> </th> <th>Offshore\nAbsolute\nReturn\nFunds </th> <th> </th> <th>Segregated\nMandates /\nManaged\nCDO / Private\nEquity /\nProperty /\nOther </th> <th> </th> <th>Investment\nTrusts </th> <th> </th> <th>Australia\nMIS </th> <th> </th> <th>U.S. Mutual\nFunds </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPerformance fees -

The activity in the year ended December 31, 2017 relates to legacy JCG.\nAdoption of updated revenue recognition guidance, particularly relating to principal-agent considerations, will significantly increase shareowner servicing fees in 2018 and onward. The Group anticipates recognizing approximately $97 million in additional shareowner servicing fees on an annualized basis, with a corresponding amount recognized as distribution expenses based on respective annualized figures in 2017. For further discussion, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased by $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Legacy JCG was the largest driver contributing $30.7 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase due to legacy JCG was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a $2.4 million reduction in relation to OEIC trading, primarily due to reduced trading in the UK Property Fund.\nOther revenue decreased $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, of which $10.1 million is due to the adverse impact of translation of non-USD denominated income.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 vs.\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 vs.\n2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>543.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>273.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>317.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (13.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term incentive plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.5 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85.9 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72.3 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distribution expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.2 </td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral, administrative and occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n202.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84.2 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n1,301.4 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n767.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n837.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69.5 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee compensation and benefits\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, employee compensation and benefits increased $269.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of legacy JCG, which contributed $190.9 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. Deal and integration costs of $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, also contributed to the year-over-year variance. The year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $10.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, employee compensation and benefits decreased $43.6 million, compared to 2015, which was primarily driven by the favorable impact of translation of non-USD denominated expenses of $35.9 million. Fixed staff costs increased by $19.4 million, primarily due to a full-year impact of the Perennial acquisition offset by lower bonus costs of $27.1 million largely reflecting weaker business performance.\nLong-term incentive plans\nLong-term incentive plans increased $63.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by legacy JCG, which contributed $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, deal and integration costs of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 contributed to the year-over-year variance. These increases were offset by a $4.4 million decrease in social security expenses, driven by lower vesting outcome for the Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") 2014, and vesting of the final Employee Share Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") matching award in the previous year. Favorable foreign currency translation of $3.4 million also benefited the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLong-term incentive plans increased by $1.6 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase was primarily due to $11.3 million of higher amortization of bonus deferrals which were in turn a function of increasing bonus awards throughout the last three years. This was partially offset by lower social security costs on award vestings as a result of a decrease in share price and by the favorable impact of translation of non-USD denominated expense of $9.7 million.\nDistribution expenses\nDistribution expenses are paid to financial intermediaries for the distribution of JHG's retail investment products and are typically calculated based on the amount of the intermediary sourced AUM. For the year ended December 31, 2017, distribution expenses increased by $68.2 million. The increase was primarily driven by JCG, which contributed $80.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining change for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to the UK OEIC and SICAV product mix, as discussed in the Management fees section.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, distribution expenses decreased by $26.5 million, which was mainly due to product mix and lower average Retail AUM, partially offset by one-time adjustments.\nAdoption of updated revenue recognition guidance, particularly relating to principal-agent considerations, will significantly increase distribution expenses in 2018 and onward. The Group anticipates recognizing approximately $97 million in additional distribution expense on an annualized basis, with a corresponding amount recognized as shareowner services based on respective annualized figures in 2017. For further discussion, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nInvestment administration\nInvestment administration expenses, which represent back-office operations, decreased $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Group signed an agreement with BNP Paribas which is expected to close in March 2018. Under the agreement, BNP Paribas will assume responsibility for the majority of JHG's back-office (including fund administration and fund accounting), middle-office and custody functions in the U.S. As a result of the agreement, the Group currently estimates investment administration expense savings of approximately $8 million in 2018.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $17.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by legacy JCG and\nMerger-related costs. Expenses in relation to the Merger increased $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Legacy JCG contributed $13.0 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGeneral, administrative and occupancy\nGeneral, administrative and occupancy expenses increased by $92.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Deal and integration costs related to the Merger, including legal and advisory fees, contributed $49.6 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. Legacy JCG (exclusive of deal and integration costs) contributed $56.9 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. The year ended December 31, 2017, benefited from a $6.9 million credit in relation to a sales tax refund dating from April 2013 and a $4.3 million favorable foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, general, administrative and occupancy decreased by $3.5 million compared to 2015. The Group was impacted by foreign currency translation in the amount of $19.6 million and other favorable variances included one-off legal and professional costs incurred in 2015. This was offset by deal costs associated with the Merger and increases in information technology costs.\nIn 2018, the Group will begin incurring research costs associated with MiFID II. MiFID II is legislative framework that is intended to strengthen investor protection and improve the functioning of financial markets making them more efficient, resilient and transparent. Currently, the Group's estimate of 2018 MiFID II research costs is approximately $19 million.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. This was primarily due to amortization of intangibles recognized as a result of the Merger.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, amortization and depreciation expense increased by $4.4 million compared to 2015, primarily due to the impairment of intangibles in relation to contracts from the disposal of the Volantis UK Small Cap alternative team assets in 2017.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 vs.\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 vs.\n2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-operating income and expenses (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(11.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(6.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>80.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(67.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.0 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.7 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.7 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n253.8 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(129.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating income (expenses), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>416.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n211.0 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34.6 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.1 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n709.8 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n467.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the Merger, the Group recognized interest expense on the 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"2018 Convertible Notes\") with a principal value of $116.6 million and the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2025 (\"2025 Senior Notes\") with a principal value of $300.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense decreased by $13.5 million compared to 2015, following the repayment of the 2016 Senior Notes in March 2016 and a favorable translation impact of $2.3 million.\nInvestment gains (losses), net\nThe components of investment gains (losses), net for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, are as follows (in millions):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 vs.\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 vs.\n2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment gains (losses), net (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on investment securities and derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(12.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(132.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(167.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on sale of equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.9 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/m* </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/m* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of Volantis\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.5 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n442.9 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(11.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(129.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*n/m - Not meaningful\nInvestment gains (losses), net improved $29.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Legacy JCG contributed $1.8 million to the year ended December 31, 2017. The year ended December 31, 2017, was also impacted by the sale of Volantis, which resulted in the recognition of a $10.2 million gain. The remaining variance for the year ended December 31, 2017 is due to fair value adjustments associated with investment securities and derivatives.\nInvestment gains in 2015 primarily represent a gain on sale of equity method investments of $18.9 million which related to the disposal of the TIAA Henderson Real Estate Limited (\"THRE\") joint venture and a gain on sale of available for sale investments of $18.3 million on the disposal of the property fund seed capital investments. In addition in 2016, the Group recorded an unrealized loss on a legacy Asian private equity investment of $17.7 million, mainly as a result of macro-economic issues in India.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe Group's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, are as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(47.1 </td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.3 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). The Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact JHG, most notably a permanent reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, JHG recognized the income tax effects of the Act in its 2017 financial statements, the reporting period in which the Act was signed into law. As a result of this rate change, JHG's deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued to account for the estimated future impact of the lower federal corporate income tax rate. The revaluation resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $345.4 million. In addition, an estimate of the one-time mandatory tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred of $4.7 million was recorded. These estimates are determined in accordance with recently issued\nSEC issued guidance provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\") allowing taxpayers to record a reasonable estimate of the impact of the U.S. legislation. In accordance with SAB 118, the actual impact from the Act may vary from the estimated amounts.\nThe benefit of the Act's rate change in 2017 is partially offset by the inclusion of the U.S. based JCG entities for the seven months after the Merger at the higher U.S. tax rates than the UK statutory rate, the predominant driver for 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group's effective tax rate increased to 16.3% from 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a number of 2015 tax benefits that either did not occur in 2016 or did not occur at the same level in 2016 and changes in the Group's global mix of pre-tax profits and business growth in higher tax jurisdictions.\nDuring 2016, tax legislation enacted in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate in future years resulted in a $4.0 million net non-cash benefit (2015: $8.1 million benefit) related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The UK corporation tax rate decreased from 20% to 19% with effect from April 1, 2017 and then to 17% with effect from April 1, 2020.\nThe Group anticipates its annual statutory tax rate will be in the 21% to 23% range in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nJHG reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, in the opinion of JHG management, the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations is best evaluated using additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and adjusted values are consistent with internal management reporting.\nJHG pro forma results\nThe table below reflects the JHG pro

JHG management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from revenue in the computation of net revenue reflects the nature of these\nexpenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties that perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the Group's managed AUM.\n(2)Adjustments primarily represent deal and integration costs in relation to the Merger, including severance costs, legal costs, consulting fees and write-down of legacy IT systems. JHG management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group.\n(3)Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are recognized at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. JHG management believes these non-cash and acquisition-related costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group.\n(4)Pro forma operating margin is pro forma operating income divided by pro forma revenue.\n(5)Adjusted pro forma operating margin is adjusted pro forma operating income divided by adjusted pro forma revenue.\n(6)Adjustments primarily represent fair value movements on options issued to Dai-ichi, deferred consideration costs associated with acquisitions prior to the Merger and increased debt expense as a consequence of the fair value uplift on debt due to acquisition accounting. JHG management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group.\n(7)Adjustment primarily relates to the gain recognized on disposal of the alternative UK small cap team (\"Volantis team\") on April 1, 2017 and adjustments related to deferred consideration costs for prior acquisitions. JHG management believes these gains do not represent the ongoing operation of the Group.\n(8)The tax impact of the adjustments is calculated based on the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate as they relate to each adjustment; certain adjustments are either not taxable or not tax-deductible. In addition, the adjustment includes the impact of U.S. tax legislation passed in December 2017.\n(9)Pro forma diluted earnings per share is pro forma net income attributable to JHG common shareholders divided by weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding.\n(10)Adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share is adjusted pro forma net income attributable to JHG common shareholders divided by weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJHG's capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, and further capital and credit market activities, if necessary, should provide the Group with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating and other obligations as they fall due and anticipated future capital requirements.\nThe following table summarizes key balance sheet data relating to JHG's liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents held by the Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n754.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n279.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities held by the Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>280.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>79.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFees and other receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n419.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n165.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>379.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash at banks held in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") and consolidated voting rights entities (\"VREs\") are not available for general corporate purposes and have been excluded from the table above.\nInvestment securities held by the Group represents seeded investment products (exclusive of consolidated VIEs and VREs), investments related to deferred compensation plans and other less significant investments.\nThe Group believes that existing cash and cash from operations should be sufficient to satisfy its short-term capital requirements. Expected short-term uses of cash include ordinary operating expenditures, seed capital investments, 2018 Convertible Notes principal, interest and redemption payments, dividend payments, income tax payments, contingent consideration payments, defined benefit pension plan contributions and integration costs in relation to the Merger.

JHG periodically adds new investment strategies to its investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investment or seeding. The primary purpose of seeded investment products is to generate an investment performance track record in a product to attract third-party investors. JHG may redeem invested seed capital for a variety of reasons, including when third-party investments in the relevant product are sufficient to sustain the investment strategy. These increases are partially offset by net cash paid to settle derivatives used in JHG's economic hedge program, and purchases of property, equipment and software.\nIn 2016, the Group's consolidated VIEs purchased investment securities of $76.6 million and paid $47.9 million on settled hedges, offset by the proceeds of disposal of seed capital investment securities of $31.6 million. In 2015, the Group received $122.7 million from the sale of the Group's investment in THRE; this was partially offset by $57.8 million of cash outflows in respect of consideration paid for the acquisitions of Perennial and 90 West.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows (in millions):\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProceeds from settlement of convertible note hedge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n59.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Settlement of stock warrant\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProceeds from issuance of options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.7 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from stock-based compensation plans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase of common stock for stock-based compensation plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(52.1 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(54.3 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(96.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends paid to shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(256.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(157.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(161.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase of common stock as part of share repurchase program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayment of long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(203.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThird-party sales (redemptions) in consolidated seeded investment products, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(141.4 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n(504.7 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n(338.6 </td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n(221.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash outflows from financing activities in 2017 were primarily due to $256.0 million of dividends paid to JHG shareholders, third-party redemptions in consolidated seeded investment products of $141.4 million and payments of $92.5 million to satisfy early conversion notices in relation to the 2018 Convertible Notes. Settlement of the conversion notices, which included principal and the conversion feature, were wholly settled in cash.\nOther Sources of Liquidity\nAt December 31, 2017, JHG had a $200 million, unsecured, revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, as coordinator, book runner and mandated lead arranger. The Credit Facility includes an option for JHG to request an increase to the overall amount of the Credit Facility of up to an additional $50.0 million. The Credit Facility had a maturity date of February 16, 2022, with two one-year extension options that can be exercised at the discretion of JHG with the lender's consent on the first and second anniversary of the date of the agreement, respectively. On the first anniversary of the date of the agreement, the Group exercised the option to extend the term of the Credit Facility by one year. The revised maturity date of the Credit Facility is February 16, 2023.\nThe Credit Facility became effective on the Closing Date and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility bears interest on borrowings outstanding at the relevant interbank offer rate plus a spread.\nThe Credit Facility contains a financial covenant with respect to leverage. The financing leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00x EBITDA. At the latest practicable date before the date of this report, JHG was in compliance with all covenants and there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nRegulatory Capital\nJHG is subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA, the U.S. CFTC, the FCA and other international regulatory bodies. The Group ensures it is compliant with its regulatory obligations at all\ntimes. The Group's main capital requirement relates to the FCA-supervised regulatory group (a sub-group of JHG), comprising Henderson Group Holdings Asset Management Limited, all of its subsidiaries and Janus Capital International Limited (\"JCIL\"). JCIL is included on the basis of an Article 134 relationship under the Banking Consolidation Directive. The combined capital requirement is \u00a3275.3 million ($372.4 million), resulting in capital above the regulatory group's regulatory requirement of \u00a344.1 million ($59.7 million) as of December 31, 2017, based upon internal calculations and excluding unaudited current period profits. Capital requirements in other jurisdictions are not significant.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and associated maturities at December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 to 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 to 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n97.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n300.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n148.1 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n90.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n80.1 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n422.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt maturing in less than one year represents the fair value of the liability and equity components of the 2018 Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2017. Debt maturing in more than five years represents the principal value of the 2025 Senior Notes.\nShort-Term Liquidity Requirements\nConvertible Notes\nUpon closing of the Merger, JHG fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of JCG under its 2018 Convertible Notes, which pay interest at 0.750% semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year and mature on July 15, 2018.\nHolders of the 2018 Convertible Notes may convert the notes during a particular calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of JHG's common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding quarter. As of January 1, 2018, the 2018 Convertible Notes met the conversion criteria and are convertible during the first quarter of 2018 at a conversion rate of 45.1535 shares of JHG common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $22.15 per share of common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, $59.1 million of principal was redeemed and settled with $92.5 million of cash. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining principal value of the 2018 Convertible Notes was $57.5 million. During the period from January 1, 2018 to February 22, 2018, an additional $22.5 million in principal was redeemed and settled with cash for a total cash outlay of $39.1 million, and additional conversion notices amounting to $25.4 million in principal had been received. JHG intends to settle the conversion notices with cash during the first quarter of 2018.\nOptions Sold to Dai-Ichi\nOn the Closing Date of the Merger, JHG sold 20 tranches of conditional options to Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc. (\"Dai-ichi\"), with each tranche allowing Dai-ichi to purchase 500,000 JHG ordinary\nshares at a strike price of \u00a329.972 per share (the terms of such options having been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Dai-ichi Option Agreement to take account of the effect of the share consolidation). Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the share consolidation. The cash consideration received for the options was \u00a319.8 million ($25.7 million). As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the options was $26.1 million. The options can be exercised by Dai-ichi during the period from the Closing Date of the Merger until October 3, 2018.\nCommon Stock Purchases\nSome of the Group's executives and employees receive rights over JHG ordinary shares as part of their remuneration arrangements and employee entitlements. These entitlements may be satisfied either by the transfer of existing ordinary shares acquired on-market or by the issue of ordinary shares. See Part 2, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Common Stock Purchases.\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on April 26, 2017, shareholders authorized JHG to make on-market purchases of up to 10% of the issued share capital of the Group at completion of the Merger. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. The Group did not make any on-market or off-market share purchases during 2017 in connection with any share buy-back program and as of the date of this report, there were no current on-market or off-market buy-backs of the Group's securities.\nDividends\nThe payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Group's Board of Directors and depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, the Group's results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and legal requirements. From the Closing Date, the Group intends to declare dividends quarterly in USD. Prior to this, the Group declared dividends in GBP on a semi-annual basis, with an extraordinary first quarter 2017 dividend declared on April 19, 2017.\nDividends declared and paid during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing the final 2016 and quarterly 2017 dividends were:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Dividend\nper share </th> <th> </th> <th>Date declared </th> <th> </th> <th>Dividends paid\n(in millions) </th> <th> </th> <th>Date paid </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u00a3\n</td> <td>\n0.0730 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 9, 2017 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n102.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMay 19, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\u00a3 </td> <td>0.0185 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 19, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 19, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n0.3200 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAugust 7, 2017 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n63.7 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSeptember 1, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.3200 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 8, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>63.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 1, 2017 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 5, 2018, JHG's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend of $0.32 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 2, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2018.The Board of Directors will review the numerous factors mentioned above when determining the first quarter 2018 dividend.\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements\nExpected long-term commitments as of December 31, 2017, include principal and interest payments related to the 2025 Senior Notes, operating and capital lease payments, defined benefit pension plan contributions, Perkins and Intech senior profits interests awards, Intech appreciation rights and phantom interests, Intech non-controlling interests and contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of Geneva, Perennial, VelocityShares and Kapstream. JHG expects to fund its long-term\ncommitments with existing cash, cash generated from operations or by accessing capital and credit markets as necessary.\n2025 Senior Notes\nUpon closing of the Merger, JHG fully and unconditionally guaranteed JCG's obligations under its 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes have a principal of $300.0 million principal in issue, which pay interest at 4.875% semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, and mature on August 1, 2025.\nPerkins Senior Profits Interests Awards\nPerkins became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group as a result of the Merger.\nOn November 18, 2013, Perkins granted senior profits interests awards designed to retain and incentivize key employees to grow the business. These awards fully vest on December 31, 2018, with the holders entitled to a total of 10% of Perkins' annual taxable income. The entitlement to a percentage of Perkins' annual taxable income over the vesting period is tiered and starts at 2% in 2015 and increases 2% each year thereafter until reaching 10% in 2019 after fully vesting on December 31, 2018. In addition, these awards have a formula-driven terminal value based on Perkins' revenue. JHG can call and terminate any or all of the awards on December 31, 2018, and each year thereafter. Holders of such interests can require JHG to purchase the interests in exchange for the then-applicable formula price on December 31, 2018. The senior profits interests awards are also subject to termination at premiums or discounts to the formula at the option of JHG or certain employees, as applicable, upon certain corporate or employment-related events affecting Perkins or certain employees.\nIntech\nIntech became a subsidiary of the Group as a result of the Merger.\nIntech ownership interests held by a founding member, representing approximately 1.1% aggregate ownership of Intech, provide this founding member with an entitlement to retain his remaining Intech interest until his death and provide the option to require JHG to purchase the ownership interests of Intech at fair value.\nIntech has granted long-term incentive awards to retain and incentivize employees. The awards consist of appreciation rights, profits interests and phantom interests, and are designed to give recipients an equity-like stake in Intech. The grant date fair value of the appreciation rights is being amortized on a graded basis over the 10-year vesting period. The awards are exercisable upon termination of employment from Intech to the extent vested. The profits interests and phantom interests awards entitle recipients to 9.2% of Intech's pre-incentive profits.\nContingent Consideration\nThe total maximum contingent amount payable related to Perennial and Geneva over the entire contingent consideration period is $47.0 million and $70.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. For additional details of the contingent consideration in relation to the acquisition of Perennial and Geneva, please refer to Note 9 - Fair Value Measurements.\nAs a result of the Merger, the Group is also committed to contingent consideration payments in respect of the historic JCG acquisitions of Kapstream and VelocityShares.\nThe outstanding Kapstream contingent cash consideration in respect to the initial acquisition of a 51% controlling interest is payable in the third quarter of 2018 if certain Kapstream AUM reach defined targets as of July 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the total maximum payment remaining is $4.1 million.\nOn January 31, 2017, JCG acquired the remaining 49% voting interest in Kapstream. The transaction included contingent consideration of up to $43.8 million. The contingent consideration will be payable in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary dates of the acquisition if certain revenue targets are reached and it is indexed to the performance of the premier share class of the Kapstream Absolute Return Income Fund. On January 31, 2018, the first anniversary of the acquisition, Kapstream reached defined revenue targets and the Group paid $15.3 million in February 2018.\nOutstanding contingent cash payments in relation to the historic acquisition of VelocityShares are contingent on certain VelocityShares' ETPs reaching defined net revenue targets on the third and fourth anniversaries of the acquisition (in November 2017 and November 2018, respectively). VelocityShares ETPs reached defined net revenue targets in November 2017, the third anniversary of the acquisition, and the Group paid contingent consideration of $3.6 million in January 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining maximum payment for the fourth and final contingent consideration payment is $8.0 million.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nThe Group's latest triennial valuation of its defined benefit pension plan resulted in a deficit on a technical provision's basis of $39.2 million (\u00a329.0 million). The Group agreed with the trustees of the plan to make contributions of $11.4 million (\u00a38.4 million) per year for four years beginning in 2017 to recover the deficit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than certain lease agreements, JHG is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that may provide, or require the Group to provide, financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support that is not reflected in JHG's consolidated financial statements. Refer to the contractual obligations table for future obligations associated with operating leases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nThe Group continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, as appropriate, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. The Group's critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the areas of investment securities, contingent consideration, goodwill and intangible assets, retirement benefit plans, and income taxes.\nValuation of Investment Securities\nThe Group records investment securities and classifies them as trading or available-for-sale at fair value. Fair value is generally determined using observable market data based on recent trading activity. Where observable market data is unavailable due to a lack of trading activity, the Group uses internally developed models to estimate fair value and independent third parties to validate assumptions, when appropriate. Estimating fair value requires significant management judgment, including benchmarking to similar instruments with observable market data and applying appropriate discounts that reflect differences between the securities that the Group is valuing and the selected benchmark. Any variation in the assumptions used to approximate fair value could have a material adverse effect on JHG's Consolidated Balance Sheets and results of operations.\nThe Group periodically evaluates the carrying value of equity method investments and investment securities classified as available-for-sale for potential impairment. In determining if an impairment exists, the Group considers the duration, extent and circumstances of any decline in fair value. Where a fall in the value of an investment is prolonged or significant, it is considered an indication of impairment.\nJHG evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio for other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the Group's intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. For equity method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment.\nIf it is determined that the impairment on a security is other than temporary, the investment is written down to fair value. An impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the security and its fair value is recognized as an impairment charge within investment gains (losses), net in JHG's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale investments, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of cumulative changes in fair value are taken to net income on impairment.\nThere were no impairment charges recognized on investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration, resulting from business combinations, is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business combination and discounted where the time value of money is material. The determination of the fair value is based on discounted cash flows, with the key assumptions being the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount factor applied. When the contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through net income. Finance charges, where discounting has been applied, are also recognized through net income.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment, including the valuation and expected life determination in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment. The judgment exercised by management in arriving at these valuations includes the selection of market growth rates, fund flow assumptions, expected margins and costs.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies and is not amortized.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent trademarks and investment management agreements. Investment management agreements without a contractual termination date are classified as indefinite lived intangible assets based upon the following: (i) there is no legal or statutory limitation on the contract period to manage these investment products; (ii) the Group expects to, and has the ability to operate these investment products indefinitely; (iii) the investment products have multiple investors and are not reliant on an individual investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv) the current competitive environment does not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. The assumption that investment management agreements are indefinite-lived assets is reviewed at least annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is no longer indefinite.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets represent certain other investment management contracts, which are amortized over their estimated lives using the straight line method. The estimated lives of the definite-lived contracts held vary and range from three years to eight years.\nImpairment Testing\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their recorded values\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually (or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may be impaired). The Group may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. A quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the related reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test requires goodwill impairments to be measured on the basis of the fair value of the reporting unit relative to the reporting unit's carrying amount.\nThe quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, impairment is recognized in the amount of the difference in values.\nThe Group performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2017. The Group elected to perform a qualitative assessment of the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Group's reporting unit and the specific intangible assets exceed their carrying values. The Group subsequently monitors market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual tests of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Group's reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. The Group considered, among other things, changes in AUM and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in impairment tests as of October 1, 2017. The Group also monitored fluctuations of JHG's common stock per share price to evaluate the Group's market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to October 1, 2017, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment only when there are indications of impairment. There were no indicators of impairment or impairment charges recognized on definite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nThe Group provides employees with retirement benefits through both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\nThe defined benefit obligation is determined annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using a discount rate based on AA rated corporate bond yields of appropriate duration. The plan assets are recognized at fair value. The funded status of the defined benefit pension plan, (the \"plan\"), being the resulting surplus or deficit of defined benefit assets less liabilities, is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of any taxes that would be deducted at source.\nActuarial gains and losses arise as a result of differences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions. The \"10% corridor\" method for recognizing actuarial gains and losses has been adopted by the Group. This means that cumulative actuarial gains or losses up to an amount equal to 10% of the higher of the liabilities and the assets of the scheme (the \"corridor\") have no immediate impact on net income and are instead recognized through other comprehensive income. Cumulative gains or losses greater than this corridor are amortized to net income over the average remaining future working lifetime of the active members in the plan.\nNet periodic benefit cost is recorded as a component of net income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and includes service cost, interest cost and the expected return on plan assets.\nThe costs of, and period end obligations under, defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making a number of assumptions including those related to the discount rate, the expected rate of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.\nThe below table shows the movement in funded status that would result from certain sensitivity changes (in millions):\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Decrease in\nfunded status at\nDecember 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscount rate: -0.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n(13.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inflation: +0.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(4.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLife expectancy: +1 year at age 65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n(21.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market value of return seeking portfolio falls 25%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(48.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Group operates in several countries, states and other taxing jurisdictions through various subsidiaries and branches, and must allocate income, expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the provision for income taxes represents the total estimate of the liability that the Group has incurred for doing business each year in all of the locations. Annually the Group files tax returns that represent filing positions within each jurisdiction and settles return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of the annual provisions are subject to judgments and\nestimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled.\nIn the assessment of uncertain tax positions, significant management judgment is required to estimate the range of possible outcomes and determine the probability, on a more likely than not basis, of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and the potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences on settlement of the Group's uncertain tax positions may be materially different to management's current estimates.\nDeferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from expectations, or if historical trends of positive operating income changes, the Group may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Group. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the Group considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods, among other factors.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of JHG, a global asset manager, and discusses the merger with JCG. The financial summary for 2017 highlights an increase in assets under management (AUM) to $370.8 billion, strong revenue and profitability growth, and improved investment performance. Revenue primarily consists of management fees and performance fees, and the report details the changes in revenue, operating expenses, and net income. It also covers the investment performance of the AUM and discusses the valuation of the assets. The report further examines management fees and performance fees, providing detailed figures and explanations for the changes in these fees over the years.", "item_7_tables": "Table 10: <table> <tr>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF JHG\nBusiness Overview\nJHG is an independent global asset manager, specializing in active investment across all major asset classes. JHG actively manages a broad range of investment products for institutional and retail investors across five capabilities: Equities, Quantitative Equities, Fixed Income, Multi-Asset and Alternatives.\nOn the Closing Date, JCG and Henderson completed a merger of equals. As a result of the Merger, JCG and its consolidated subsidiaries became subsidiaries of Henderson, which was renamed to Janus Henderson Group plc.

However, information is reported to the chief operating decision-makers, the Co-Chief Executive Officers (\"Co-CEOs\"), on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by the Co-CEOs and, on this basis, the Group operates as a single segment investment management business.\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of management fees and performance fees. Management fees are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of AUM and are calculated using either the daily, month-end or quarter-end average asset balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Accordingly, fluctuations in the financial markets have a direct effect on the Group's operating results. Additionally, AUM may outperform or underperform the financial markets and therefore may fluctuate in varying degrees from that of the general market.\nPerformance fees are specified in certain fund and client contracts and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an established index over a specified period of time. This is often subject to a hurdle rate. Performance fees are recognized at the end of the contractual period (typically monthly, quarterly or annually) if the stated performance criteria are achieved. Certain fund and client contracts allow for negative performance fees where there is underperformance against the relevant index.\n2017 SUMMARY\n2017 Highlights\n\u2022 Completion of the Merger with JCG on May 30, 2017.

Adjusted non-GAAP figures are presented in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,743.7 million, an increase of $743.8 million, or 74%, from December 31, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by legacy JCG revenues of $680.8 million in 2017. Average AUM (excluding JCG) increased by 6% and positively affected management fees during 2017, compared to 2016. Performance fees improved in 2017 by $55.4 million compared to 2016, which contributed to the increase in revenue. These increases are partially offset by lower average management fee margins and adverse foreign currency translation.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,301.4 million, an increase of $533.6 million, or 69%, compared to operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legacy JCG operations contributed $405.0 million to operating expenses in 2017 and total deal and integration costs in 2017 contributed $126.2 million.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $442.3 million, an increase of $210.2 million, or 91%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Group's operating margin was 25.4% in 2017, compared to 23.2% in 2016. Legacy JCG operations contributed $275.8 million to operating income in the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase of $110.5 million of deal and integration costs related to the Merger and a reduction in expenditures year-over-year as the Group concentrated on integration.\nNet income attributable to JHG in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $655.5 million, an increase of $466.5 million, or 247%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Group recorded a one-time tax benefit of $340.7 million due to changes in U.S. tax laws. Legacy JCG operations contributed $173.1 million to net income attributable to JHG in 2017. Performance fees improved in 2017 and contributed $55.4 million to the year-over-year change. These increases were partially offset by deal and integration costs related to the Merger.\nInvestment Performance of Assets Under Management\nThe following table is a summary of investment performance as of December 31, 2017:\n\n(1)Includes JCG performance.\nAssets Under Management\nThe Group's AUM as of December 31, 2017, was $370.8 billion, an increase of $246.1 billion, or 197% from December 31, 2016, driven primarily by net acquisitions of $205.8 billion representing JCG's AUM of $206.5 billion, offset by disposals of $0.7 billion. Positive market movements in the period contributed $31.7 billion and the weakening of the USD resulted in favorable foreign exchange movements of $11.6 billion. This was partially offset by net outflows of $3.0 billion, which includes flows from JCG from the Closing Date.\nDuring 2017, the USD weakened against all major currencies. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of the Group's AUM was non-USD denominated, resulting in a favorable currency effect, particularly in products exposed to GBP.\nJHG's ETNs are not included within the AUM as JHG is not the named adviser or subadviser to ETNs. ETN assets totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset and flows by capability for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (includes JCG activity from the Closing Date), are as follows (in billions):\n\n\n\n(1)AUM as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 has been reclassified between capabilities following the completion of the Merger.\n(2)Redemptions include the impact of client transfers which could cause a positive balance on occasion.\n(3)FX reflects movements in AUM resulting from changes in foreign currency rates as non-USD denominated AUM is translated into USD.\nClosing Assets Under Management\nThe following table presents the closing AUM, split by client type and client location as of December 31, 2017 (in billions):\n\n\nValuation of Assets Under Management\nThe fair value of AUM is based on the value of the underlying cash and investment securities of the funds, trusts and segregated mandates. A significant proportion of these securities are listed or quoted on a recognized securities exchange or market and are regularly traded thereon; these investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted market prices. Investments including, but not limited to, over-the-counter derivative contracts, (which are dealt in or through a clearing firm), exchange or financial institution will be valued by reference to the most recent official settlement price quoted by the appointed market vendor and in the event no price is available from this source,\na broker quotation may be used. Physical property held is valued monthly by a specialist independent appraiser.\nWhen a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The Fair Value Pricing Committee is responsible for determining or approving these unquoted prices, which are reported to those charged with governance of the funds and trusts. For funds that invest in markets that are closed at their valuation point, an assessment is made daily to determine whether a fair value pricing adjustment is required to the fund's valuation. This may be due to significant market movements in other correlated open markets, scheduled market closures or unscheduled market closures as a result of natural disaster or government intervention.\nFor legacy Henderson funds, third-party administrators hold a key role in the collection and validation of prices used in the valuation of the securities. Daily price validation is completed using techniques such as day-on-day tolerance movements, invariant prices, excessive movement checks and intra-vendor tolerance checks. The JHG Data Management Team performs oversight of this process and completes annual due diligence on the processes of third parties.\nFor legacy JCG funds, the Group performs a number of procedures to validate the pricing received from third-party providers. For actively traded equity securities, prices are received daily from both a primary and secondary vendor. For fixed income securities, prices are received daily from a primary vendor and weekly from a secondary vendor. Prices from the primary and secondary vendors are compared to identify any discrepancies. In the event of a discrepancy, a price challenge may be issued to both vendors. Securities with significant day to day price changes require additional research, which may include a review of all news pertaining to the issue and issuer and any corporate actions. All fixed income prices are reviewed by JHG's fixed income trading desk to incorporate market activity information available to JHG's traders. In the event the traders have received price indications from market makers for a particular issue, this information is transmitted to the pricing vendors.\nJHG leverages the expertise of its fund management teams across the business to cross-invest assets and create value for its clients. Where cross investment occurs, assets and flows are identified and the duplication is removed.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\n\n*n/m - Not meaningful\nManagement fees\nManagement fees increased by $597.3 million, or 68.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 with the inclusion of seven months of legacy JCG management fees of $584.9 million as the largest driver. Average AUM (excluding JCG) increased by 6% and positively affected management fees during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. Positive market movements contributed $80.2 million to the increase in management fees over the year. These increases are partially offset by the effect of adverse foreign currency translations ($11.0) million, net outflows causing a decrease in management fees ($50.3) million, and lower average gross fee margins. Lower margins are primarily from a change in product mix (i.e., switch in share classes as a result of the Retail Distribution Review within Europe to a lower fee share class), and are partially offset by a decrease in distribution expenses.\nManagement fees decreased by $46.9 million, or (5.1%), from 2015 to 2016, despite average AUM increasing by 1.3% year-over-year. Although average institutional AUM increased by 6.1%, average retail AUM decreased by 1.5% resulting in a mix shift from higher margin retail fees to lower margin institutional fees. In addition, management fee margins decreased due to the share class change as explained above. As a result, distribution costs also fell during the period.\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations, markets and 2016 outflows caused a net decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by a net favorable full year impact of 2015 inflows and the full year favorable impact of acquisitions.\nPerformance fees\nPerformance fees are derived across a number of product ranges. Pooled fund and segregated mandate performance fees are recognized on a quarterly or annual basis, while mutual fund performance fees are recognized on a monthly basis. Performance fees by product type consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\n\n*n/m - Not meaningful\nPerformance fees increased by $49.1 million, or 89.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in SICAV performance fees. Performance fees for UK OEICs and Unit Trusts also increased in the period. These increases are partially offset by $6.3 million of net negative performance fees related to legacy JCG.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $96.0 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower SICAV fees which for long-only funds typically only pay out a performance fee if relative and absolute performance is positive. Offshore Absolute Return fees decreased by 64.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower performance fees on pooled hedge funds.\nThe following table outlines performance fees by product type and includes information on fees earned, number of funds generating performance fees, AUM generating performance fees, number of funds eligible to earn performance fees, AUM with an un-crystalized performance fee, performance fee participation rate, performance fee frequency and performance fee methodology (dollars in millions, except", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

This was partially offset by net outflows of $3.0 billion, which includes flows from JCG from the Closing Date.\nDuring 2017, the USD weakened against all major currencies. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of the Group's AUM was non-USD denominated, resulting in a favorable currency effect, particularly in products exposed to GBP.\nJHG's ETNs are not included within the AUM as JHG is not the named adviser or subadviser to ETNs. ETN assets totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset and flows by capability for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (includes JCG activity from the Closing Date), are as

securities of the funds, trusts and segregated mandates. A significant proportion of these securities are listed or quoted on a recognized securities exchange or market and are regularly traded thereon; these investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted market prices. Investments including, but not limited to, over-the-counter derivative contracts, (which are dealt in or through a clearing firm), exchange or financial institution will be valued by reference to the most recent official settlement price quoted by the appointed market vendor and in the event no price is available from this source,\na broker quotation may be used. Physical property held is valued monthly by a specialist independent appraiser.\nWhen a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The Fair Value Pricing Committee is responsible for determining or approving these unquoted prices, which are reported to those charged with governance of the funds and trusts. For funds that invest in markets that are closed at their valuation point, an assessment is made daily to determine whether a fair value pricing adjustment is required to the fund's valuation. This may be due to significant market movements in other correlated open markets, scheduled market closures or unscheduled market closures as a result of natural disaster or government intervention.\nFor legacy Henderson funds, third-party administrators hold a key role in the collection and validation of prices used in the valuation of the securities. Daily price validation is completed using techniques such as day-on-day tolerance movements, invariant prices, excessive movement checks and intra-vendor tolerance checks. The JHG Data Management Team performs oversight of this process and completes annual due diligence on the processes of third parties.\nFor legacy JCG funds, the Group performs a number of procedures to validate the pricing received from third-party providers. For actively traded equity securities, prices are received daily from both a primary and secondary vendor. For fixed income securities, prices are received daily from a primary vendor and weekly from a secondary vendor. Prices from the primary and secondary vendors are compared to identify any discrepancies. In the event of a discrepancy, a price challenge may be issued to both vendors. Securities with significant day to day price changes require additional research, which may include a review of all news pertaining to the issue and issuer and any corporate actions. All fixed income prices are reviewed by JHG's fixed income trading desk to incorporate market activity information available to JHG's traders. In the event the traders have received price indications from market makers for a particular issue, this information is transmitted to the pricing vendors.\nJHG leverages the expertise of its fund management teams across the business to cross-invest assets and create value for its clients. Where cross investment occurs, assets and flows are identified and the duplication is removed.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 vs.\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 vs.\n2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,465.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>867.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>914.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPerformance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n103.9 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150.8 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.6 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shareowner servicing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n103.2 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77.3 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89.6 </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.5 </td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,743.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>999.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,155.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (13.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*n/m - Not meaningful\nManagement fees\nManagement fees increased by $597.3 million, or 68.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 with the inclusion of seven months of legacy JCG management fees of $584.9 million as the largest driver. Average AUM (excluding JCG) increased by 6% and positively affected management fees during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. Positive market movements contributed $80.2 million to the increase in management fees over the year. These increases are partially offset by the effect of adverse foreign currency translations ($11.0) million, net outflows causing a decrease in management fees ($50.3) million, and lower average gross fee margins. Lower margins are primarily from a change in product mix (i.e., switch in share classes as a result of the Retail Distribution Review within Europe to a lower fee share class), and are partially offset by a decrease in distribution expenses.\nManagement fees decreased by $46.9 million, or (5.1%), from 2015 to 2016, despite average AUM increasing by 1.3% year-over-year. Although average institutional AUM increased by 6.1%, average retail AUM decreased by 1.5% resulting in a mix shift from higher margin retail fees to lower margin institutional fees. In addition, management fee margins decreased due to the share class change as explained above. As a result, distribution costs also fell during the period.\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations, markets and 2016 outflows caused a net decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by a net favorable full year impact of 2015 inflows and the full year favorable impact of acquisitions.\nPerformance fees\nPerformance fees are derived across a number of product ranges. Pooled fund and segregated mandate performance fees are recognized on a quarterly or annual basis, while mutual fund performance fees are recognized on a monthly basis.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in SICAV performance fees. Performance fees for UK OEICs and Unit Trusts also increased in the period. These increases are partially offset by $6.3 million of net negative performance fees related to legacy JCG.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $96.0 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower SICAV fees which for long-only funds typically only pay out a performance fee if relative and absolute performance is positive. Offshore Absolute Return fees decreased by 64.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower performance fees on pooled hedge funds.\nThe following table outlines performance fees by product type and includes information on fees earned, number of funds generating performance fees, AUM generating performance fees, number of funds eligible to earn performance fees, AUM with an un-crystalized performance fee, performance fee participation rate, performance fee frequency and performance fee methodology (dollars in millions, except"}
