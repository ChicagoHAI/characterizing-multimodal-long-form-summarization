Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are the largest owner, manager and developer of high quality student housing properties in the United States. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nWe believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property portfolio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned operating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned properties under development:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - properties under development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we expect to be converted to the on-campus participating property (\"OCCP\") structure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes 33 properties operated under ground/facility leases with 16 university systems and one property operated under a ground/facility lease with Walt Disney World\u00ae Resort.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2018 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for the 2017/2018 and the 2018/2019 academic years. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% with a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was 95.5%. As of September 30, 2018, the beginning of the 2018/2019 academic year, occupancy at our 2019 same store properties was 97.0% with a rental rate increase of 2.0% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was also 97.0%.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients, and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2018, we were under contract on five third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $20.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, fees of approximately $7.0 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates primarily in 2019 and 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 34 properties that represented approximately 24,800 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Certain of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed. In some circumstances, lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures. These amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the funds are not available to us for current use.\nFor our properties under development, capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our total debt. Upon substantial completion of the properties, cost capitalization ceases. The total capitalized development costs are then transferred to the applicable asset category and depreciation commences. These estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two

Same store operating expenses also include an allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight.\nA reconciliation of our same store, new property, and sold/held for sale/other property operations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set forth below:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Same Store Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sold/Held for Sale/Other Properties (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total - All Properties\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of properties (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of beds (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>692,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>829,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Does not include the allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes three properties sold in 2018, one property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017, and one property at Prairie View A&M University that was converted to the OCPP structure in January 2019.

Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2010 academic year at our various properties.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to increased property tax expense resulting from higher property tax assessments in various markets, and increases related to 2016 development deliveries and acquisitions that were assessed at full value for the first time. We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to increases in property taxes, payroll and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition/Opening Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Arlie\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Arlington, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TWELVE at U District\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seattle, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The 515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eugene, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Oregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The James (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Madison, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Wisconsin -

Revenues from these properties increased by $0.7 million, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 75.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $0.2 million, from $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of general inflation. We anticipate that revenues from these properties will increase primarily due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019. In addition, future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2020 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our on-campus participating properties for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019 and general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue decreased by approximately $3.5 million, from $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017; and (iii) the completion of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of the Delaware State University project in May 2018 and the Dundee Residence Hall and Glasgow Dining Hall at the University of California, Riverside in December 2018. These two projects contributed $4.4 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we also continued development services for three projects that commenced construction in 2017, for which we earned fees of approximately $2.7 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate that third-party development services revenue will increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to an increase in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.1 million, from $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding $5.8 million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction in May 2018, $2.9 million of transactions incurred in connection with our initial investment in the Core Transaction in August 2017, and $4.5 million in contractual executive separation and retirement charges incurred in the first and second quarter 2017, general and administrative expense increased $4.7 million. This increase was primarily due to additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform, and other general inflationary factors. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the transaction costs incurred in 2018, offset by an increase in payroll costs and an increase in expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $28.2 million, from $235.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $263.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $22.7 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of ten owned development properties in August 2017 and ten owned development and presale development properties in August 2018; (ii) an $8.8 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2017; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to properties sold in 2017 and 2018. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the completion of owned development projects in Fall 2018 and Fall 2019, offset by property dispositions completed during 2018 and anticipated during 2019.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.7 million from $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. We anticipate ground/facility leases expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the timing of new ACE projects being placed into service, and the conversion of one owned property to the OCPP structure in January 2019.\nGain (Loss) from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold three owned properties containing 1,338 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $42.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one owned property containing 657 beds, resulting in a net loss from disposition of real estate of approximately $0.6 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $15.3 million for one owned property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of this transaction.\nOther Operating Income\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $2.6 million gain related to cash proceeds received from a litigation settlement.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $28.1 million, from $71.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $99.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense increased as a result of the following: (i) an $11.2 million increase in interest expense related to our $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017; (ii) an $8.0 million increase due to the issuance of $330 million in mortgage debt as part of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction; (iii) a $4.2 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable twelve month periods; (iv) $3.4 million in interest related to closings of a new $300 million term loan in September 2017 and a new $200 million term loan in June 2017; (v) a $2.5 million increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility; and (vi) a $1.0 million increase in accrued default interest on one of our properties that is currently in receivership and is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.5 million decrease related to the pay-off of maturing mortgage loans during 2017 and 2018; and (ii) an $0.8 million decrease related to the disposition of properties with outstanding debt during 2017 and 2018.\nWe anticipate interest expense will increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to increased interest rates on a higher average outstanding balance under the Company's revolving credit facility throughout 2019, additional interest incurred from $330 million in mortgage debt as part of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction, and additional interest incurred from any additional unsecured debt anticipated during 2019.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs increased by approximately $1.2 million, from $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) $0.9 million of accelerated amortization related to the pay-off of $450 million of term loan debt in May 2018; and (ii) $0.4 million in amortization expense related to our $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017. We anticipate amortization of deferred finance costs will decrease in 2019, as increases related to anticipated offerings of unsecured debt during 2019 will be more than offset by the 2018 accelerated amortization related to the pay-off of term loan debt.\nGain from Extinguishment of Debt, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net gain of $7.9 million due to the extinguishment of debt. This amount was comprised of an $8.7 million gain resulting from the unwinding of a new market tax credit structure, and $0.8 million of losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans in connection with the sale of one owned property and one owned property contributed to the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction. Refer to Note 6 and Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nOther Nonoperating Income\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million gain related to insurance settlements associated with two of our owned properties.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision expense increased by approximately $1.4 million, from $1.0 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to estimated state income tax related to a taxable gain resulting from the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent holders of common and preferred units in our Operating Partnership not held by ACC or ACC Holdings as well as certain third-party partners in joint ventures consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, these external partners are allocated their share of income/loss during the respective reporting periods. Refer to Note 9 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following

Properties: The increase in revenue from our same store properties was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 academic years, partially offset by a slight decrease in our weighted average occupancy from 94.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016, to 94.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to: (i) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of approximately $2.0 million related to cleanup and repairs for water intrusion, roofing, and landscaping at the Company's communities located in Florida and Texas, as a result of hurricanes Harvey and Irma; (ii) an increase in property taxes and related consulting fees due to increased property tax assessments in various markets as well as increases related to 2015 development deliveries caused primarily by the stabilization of property tax assessments in the second year of operations; (iii) additional marketing expenses incurred due to our efforts to achieve our leasing targets; and (iv) other general inflationary factors.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31,

Revenues from these properties increased by $0.5 million, from $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $1.0 million, from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) an increase in payroll costs due to recently filled staff positions, which were previously vacant; (ii) increased maintenance costs related to the annual turn process; (iii) an increase in utilities expense; and (iv) increases in general and administrative costs.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue increased by approximately $6.2 million, from $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; and (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $1.1 million in 2017; and (ii) the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University of Kansas during the year ended December 31, 2016, for which the Company earned a $0.5 million fee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services Expenses\nThird-party development and management services expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million, from $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight, and general inflation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.9 million, from $22.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) $4.5 million in contractual executive separation and retirement charges incurred in the first and second quarter 2017 as a result of the retirement of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer; (ii) $2.9 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with our initial investment in the Core Transaction in August 2017; (iii) increases in travel and related pursuit costs for potential acquisition transactions; (iv) additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform, and (v) other general inflationary factors.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $23.6 million, from $211.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $235.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $16.3 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of seven owned development properties in August and September of 2016 and ten owned development properties in August 2017; (ii) a $12.1 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2016 and 2017; (iii) a $7.9 million increase in depreciation expense at our same store properties due to capital improvement projects at various properties; and (iv) a $0.4 million increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were partially offset by a $13.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to properties sold in 2016 and 2017.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.0 million, from $9.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017.\n(Loss) Gain from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one owned property containing 657 beds, resulting in a net loss from disposition of real estate of approximately $0.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 21 owned properties containing 13,407 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $21.2 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $15.3 million for one owned property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. During year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $4.9 million related to an owned property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016 and subsequently sold in April 2017. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of our property dispositions.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased by approximately $0.6 million, from $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily due to additional interest earned during 2016 on cash proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $7.6 million, from $78.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense decreased as a result of the following: (i) a decrease of approximately $7.9 million related to the disposition of properties with outstanding mortgage debt during 2016; (ii) a $4.3 million decrease related to the pay-off of mortgage loans during 2017 and 2016; (iii) a decrease of approximately $4.1 million due to the pay-off of $450 million of outstanding term loan debt in 2016; (iv) a $3.6 million increase in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable twelve month periods; and (v) a decrease of $0.7 million related to lower outstanding balances on our mortgage debt due to continued scheduled principal payments. These decreases were partially offset by (i) a $4.6 million increase in interest related to closings of a new $300 million term loan in September 2017 and a new $200 million term loan in June 2017; (ii) a $3.8 million increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility; (iii) a $3.3 million increase in interest expense related to our $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017; and (iv) a $1.2 million increase in accrued default interest on one of our properties that is currently in receivership and is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs decreased by approximately $1.9 million, from $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) $1.1 million of accelerated amortization related to the early pay-off of our $250 million term loan in February 2016; (ii) $0.7 million related to the pay-off of $200 million of our $350 million term loan in November 2016; and (iii) $0.3 million related to properties with mortgage debt sold in 2016.\nLoss from Extinguishment of Debt, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred approximately $12.8 million of losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans in connection with the sale of nine owned properties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Balances and Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $106.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as compared to $64.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of December 31, 2017. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits, as required by law in certain states, and funds held in escrow in connection with potential acquisition and development opportunities. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 herein.\nOperating Activities: For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $376.6 million, as compared to approximately $318.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $57.9 million. This increase in cash flows was due to the timing of property tax payments for owned properties, as well as operating cash flows provided by the completion of construction and opening of ten owned development properties in the third quarter of 2017, six owned development properties in August 2018, four presale developments in August 2018, and property acquisitions in 2017, offset by properties disposed of in 2017 and 2018.\nInvesting Activities: Investing activities utilized approximately $335.8 million and $977.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $642.0 million decrease in cash utilized in investing activities was primarily a result of the following: (i) a $348.9 million decrease in cash paid to acquire properties and land parcels; (ii) a $217.8 million increase in proceeds from property dispositions related to the sale of a three property portfolio in May 2018; (iii) a $59.5 million decrease in cash used to fund the construction of our owned development properties, related to the timing of construction commencement and completion of our owned development pipeline; and (iv) an $11.8 million decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures at our owned and on-campus participating properties.\nFinancing Activities: Cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $676.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $676.0 million decrease was primarily a result of the following: (i) 450.0 million in cash used to pay down the Company's $300 million and $150 million unsecured term loans in May 2018; (ii) a $500.0 million decrease in proceeds from unsecured term loans; (iii) a $399.6 million decrease due to proceeds from the offering of unsecured notes in October 2017; (iv) a $188.5 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock related to the issuance of common stock under our ATM Equity Program in 2017; (v) a $76.6 million increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests primarily as a result of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction; (vi) a $41.1 million increase in cash used to pay off mortgage debt, including defeasance costs; (vii) a $14.0 million increase in distributions to common and restricted stockholders; and (viii) $10.5 million paid in 2018 to increase our ownership of a consolidated subsidiary. These decreases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $367.6 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests primarily due to the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction (refer to Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8); (ii) $330.0 million in proceeds from mortgage debt issued by the previously mentioned ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction; (iii) a $231.4 million increase in net proceeds on our revolving credit facility; (iv) $60.7 million in increased proceeds from construction loans; (v) an $11.4 million decrease in payments of debt issuance costs; and (vi) a $2.2 million decrease in taxes paid on net share settlements.\nLiquidity Needs, Sources and Uses of Capital\nAs of December 31, 2018, our short-term liquidity needs included, but were not limited to, the following: (i) anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately $253.7 million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of $1.84 per share and based on the number of our shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; (ii) anticipated distribution payments to our Operating Partnership unitholders totaling approximately $1.3 million based on an assumed annual distribution of $1.84 per common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of 5.99% on our Preferred OP Units based on the number of units outstanding as of December 31, 2018; (iii) estimated development costs over the next 12 months totaling approximately $325.3 million for our owned properties currently under construction; (iv) an $89.6 million obligation to purchase two properties subject to presale arrangements (see Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8); (v) an obligation to increase our investment in two joint ventures (the Core Joint Ventures\u201d), resulting in a funding commitment of approximately $154.0 million (see Note 5 and Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8); (vi) funds for other development projects scheduled to commence construction during the next 12 months; and (vii) potential future property or land acquisitions, including mezzanine financed developments.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements by (i) borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility; (ii) accessing the unsecured bond market or entering into other unsecured debt arrangements; (iii) exercising debt extension options to the extent\nthey are available; (iv) issuing securities, including common stock, under our ATM Equity Program discussed more fully in Note 11 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, or otherwise; (v) potentially disposing of properties and/or entering into joint venture arrangements, depending on market conditions; and (vi) utilizing current cash on hand and net cash provided by operations. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\nWe may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls. We also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise. Future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing, including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity securities. These funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors, including future market conditions, our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets, our future creditworthiness, and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders, including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes. These financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders.\nIndebtedness\nA summary of our consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 is as follows. Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of our indebtedness.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Rates (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Maturities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>844,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,187,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consolidated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,031,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project-based taxable bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2013 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2014 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2015 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2017 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total -

Distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. We may use borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund distributions. The Board of Directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels, including market factors and our Company's performance in addition to REIT requirements.\nOn January 22, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.46 per share, which was paid on February 15, 2019, to all common stockholders of record as of February 1, 2019. At the same time, the Operating Partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of Common Units, as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of Series A Preferred Units.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between the following five categories of capital expenditures:\nRecurring capital expenditures represent additions that are recurring in nature to maintain a property's income, value, and competitive position within the market. Recurring capital expenditures typically include, but are not limited to, appliances, furnishings, carpeting and flooring, HVAC equipment and kitchen/bath cabinets. Maintenance and repair costs incurred throughout the year including those incurred during our annual turn process due to normal wear and tear by residents are expensed as incurred.\nAcquisition-related capital expenditures represent additions identified upon acquiring a property and are considered part of the initial investment. These expenditures are intended to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards and are usually incurred within the first two and occasionally the third year after acquisition.\nRenovations and strategic repositioning capital expenditures are incurred to enhance the economic value and return of the property and undergo an investment return underwrite prior to being incurred.\nNon-recurring and other capital expenditures represent the addition of features or amenities that did not exist at the property but were deemed necessary to remain competitive within a specific market.

We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO excludes GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. We therefore believe that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, among other items, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (and as subsequently amended), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWe also believe it is meaningful to present a measure we refer to as FFO-Modified, or FFOM, which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our on-campus participating properties, the elimination of transaction costs, and other items, as we determine in good faith. Under our participating ground leases, we and the participating university systems each receive 50% of the properties' net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service (which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal) and capital expenditures. A substantial portion of our revenues attributable\nto these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness. These amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness. Therefore, unlike the ownership of our owned properties, the unique features of our ownership interest in our on-campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time. For example, since the ground/facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt, such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor. Accordingly, we believe it is meaningful to modify FFO to exclude the operations of our on-campus participating properties and to consider their impact on our performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive, both of which increase and decrease with the operating performance of the properties. This narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our third-party services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization. We believe, however, that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner's long-term profitability from its investment.\nOur FFOM may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on-campus participating properties, which is unique to us and is different from that of our owned off-campus properties. Companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures; and therefore, those companies may not calculate FFOM in the same manner that we do, or at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP and FFO results and using FFOM only supplementally. Further, FFO and FFOM do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties. FFO and FFOM should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our liquidity, nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO and FFOM:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to ACC, Inc. and Subsidiaries common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss from disposition of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of provision for real estate impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation and amortization (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders and OP unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of operations of on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,194\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of investment in on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,819\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modifications to reflect operational performance of on-campus participating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of net cash flow (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution from on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of gains from extinguishment of debt, net (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of gain from insurance and litigation settlements (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of FFO from property in receivership (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual executive separation and retirement charges (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are the largest owner, manager and developer of high quality student housing properties in the United States. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nWe believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (1) Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we expect to be converted to the on-campus participating property (\"OCCP\") structure. \n (2) Includes 33 properties operated under ground/facility leases with 16 university systems and one property operated under a ground/facility lease with Walt Disney World\u00ae Resort. \nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2018 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for the 2017/2018 and the 2018/2019 academic years. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% with a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was 95.5%. As of September 30, 2018, the beginning of the 2018/2019 academic year, occupancy at our 2019 same store properties was 97.0% with a rental rate increase of 2.0% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was also 97.0%.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients, and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2018, we were under contract on five third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $20.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, fees of approximately $7.0 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates primarily in 2019 and 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 34 properties that represented approximately 24,800 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Certain of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed. In some circumstances, lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures. These amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the funds are not available to us for current use.\nFor our properties under development, capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our total debt. Upon substantial completion of the properties, cost capitalization ceases. The total capitalized development costs are then transferred to the applicable asset category and depreciation commences. These estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods.\n\n (1) The SEC's issuance of the Disclosure Update and Simplification rule in 2018 eliminated Rule 3-15(a)(1) of Regulation S-X, which required REITs to present separately all gains and losses on sales of properties outside of continuing operations on the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The adoption of this rule resulted in reclassifications of 2017 losses from disposition of real estate from non-operating income to operating income which are reflected in the table above. See Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further discussion. \nSame Store and New Property Operations\nWe define our same store property portfolio as owned properties that were owned and operating for both of the full years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nSame store revenues are defined as revenues generated from our same store portfolio and consist of rental revenue earned from student leases as well as other income items such as utility income, damages, parking income, summer conference rent, application and administration fees, income from retail tenants, and income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS\u201d) from ancillary activities such as the provision of food services.\nSame store operating expenses are defined as operating expenses generated from our same store portfolio and include usual and customary expenses incurred to operate a property such as payroll, maintenance, utilities, marketing, general and administrative costs, insurance, property taxes, and bad debt. Same store operating expenses also include an allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight.\nA reconciliation of our same store, new property, and sold/held for sale/other property operations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set forth below:\n\n (1) Does not include the allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight. \n (2) Includes three properties sold in 2018, one property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017, and one property at Prairie View A&M University that was converted to the OCPP structure in January 2019. Also includes transaction costs and recurring professional fees related to the formation and operation of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture. \n (3) Includes properties sold in 2018 and 2017. As discussed above, it also includes one property that is in the process of being transferred to the lender and one property that was converted to the OCPP structure. \n (4) Does not include properties under construction or undergoing redevelopment. \n (5) Difference from total operating property portfolio represents three properties that were sold during the second quarter 2018. \n (6) Includes revenues which are reflected as resident services revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. \nSame Store Properties: The increase in revenue from our same store properties was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years, offset by a decrease in our weighted average occupancy from 94.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017, to 93.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2010 academic year at our various properties.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to increased property tax expense resulting from higher property tax assessments in various markets, and increases related to 2016 development deliveries and acquisitions that were assessed at full value for the first time. We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to increases in property taxes, payroll and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized in the table below:\n\n (1) Properties are held by two joint ventures formed as part of the Core Transaction. Refer to Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. \nOn-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP\u201d) Operations\nSame Store OCPP Properties: We had five on-campus participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017. Revenues from these properties increased by $0.7 million, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 75.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $0.2 million, from $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of general inflation. We anticipate that revenues from these properties will increase primarily due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019. In addition, future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2020 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our on-campus participating properties for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019 and general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue decreased by approximately $3.5 million, from $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017; and (iii) the completion of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of the Delaware State University project in May 2018 and the Dundee Residence Hall and Glasgow Dining Hall at the University of California, Riverside in December 2018. These two projects contributed $4.4 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we also continued development services for three projects that commenced construction in 2017, for which we earned fees of approximately $2.7 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate that third-party development services revenue will increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to an increase in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.1 million, from $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding $5.8 million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction in May 2018, $2.9 million of transactions incurred in connection with our initial investment in the Core Transaction in August 2017, and $4.5 million in contractual executive separation and retirement charges incurred in the first and second quarter 2017, general and administrative expense increased $4.7 million. This increase was primarily due to additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform, and other general inflationary factors. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the transaction costs incurred in 2018, offset by an increase in payroll costs and an increase in expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $28.2 million, from $235.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $263.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $22.7 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of ten owned development properties in August 2017 and ten owned development and presale development properties in August 2018; (ii) an $8.8 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2017; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to properties sold in 2017 and 2018. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the completion of owned development projects in Fall 2018 and Fall 2019, offset by property dispositions completed during 2018 and anticipated during 2019.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.7 million from $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. We anticipate ground/facility leases expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the timing of new ACE projects being placed into service, and the conversion of one owned property to the OCPP structure in January 2019.\nGain (Loss) from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold three owned properties containing 1,338 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $42.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one owned property containing 657 beds, resulting in a net loss from disposition of real estate of approximately $0.6 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $15.3 million for one owned property currently", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are the largest owner, manager and developer of high quality student housing properties in the United States. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nWe believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property portfolio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned operating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned properties under development:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - properties under development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we expect to be converted to the on-campus participating property (\"OCCP\") structure. \n (2) Includes 33 properties operated under ground/facility leases with 16 university systems and one property operated under a ground/facility lease with Walt Disney World\u00ae Resort. \nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2018 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for the 2017/2018 and the 2018/2019 academic years. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% with a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was 95.5%. As of September 30, 2018, the beginning of the 2018/2019 academic year, occupancy at our 2019 same store properties was 97.0% with a rental rate increase of 2.0% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio was also 97.0%.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients, and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2018, we were under contract on five third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $20.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, fees of approximately $7.0 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates primarily in 2019 and 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 34 properties that represented approximately 24,800 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Certain of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed.

in 2018 eliminated Rule 3-15(a)(1) of Regulation S-X, which required REITs to present separately all gains and losses on sales of properties outside of continuing operations on the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The adoption of this rule resulted in reclassifications of 2017 losses from disposition of real estate from non-operating income to operating income which are reflected in the table above.

Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2010 academic year at our various properties.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to increased property tax expense resulting from higher property tax assessments in various markets, and increases related to 2016 development deliveries and acquisitions that were assessed at full value for the first time. We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to increases in property taxes, payroll and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition/Opening Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Arlie\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Arlington, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TWELVE at U District\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seattle, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The 515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eugene, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Oregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The James (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Madison, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Wisconsin -

Revenues from these properties increased by $0.7 million, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 75.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $0.2 million, from $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of general inflation. We anticipate that revenues from these properties will increase primarily due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019. In addition, future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2018/2019 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2019/2020 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our on-campus participating properties for 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to the conversion of one property to the OCPP structure in January 2019 and general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue decreased by approximately $3.5 million, from $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017; and (iii) the completion of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of the Delaware State University project in May 2018 and the Dundee Residence Hall and Glasgow Dining Hall at the University of California, Riverside in December 2018. These two projects contributed $4.4 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we also continued development services for three projects that commenced construction in 2017, for which we earned fees of approximately $2.7 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate that third-party development services revenue will increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to an increase in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.1 million, from $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding $5.8 million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the ACC / Allianz Joint Venture Transaction in May 2018, $2.9 million of transactions incurred in connection with our initial investment in the Core Transaction in August 2017, and $4.5 million in contractual executive separation and retirement charges incurred in the first and second quarter 2017, general and administrative expense increased $4.7 million. This increase was primarily due to additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform, and other general inflationary factors. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the transaction costs incurred in 2018, offset by an increase in payroll costs and an increase in expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $28.2 million, from $235.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $263.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $22.7 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of ten owned development properties in August 2017 and ten owned development and presale development properties in August 2018; (ii) an $8.8 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2017; and (iii) a $1.2 million increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to properties sold in 2017 and 2018. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the completion of owned development projects in Fall 2018 and Fall 2019, offset by property dispositions completed during 2018 and anticipated during 2019.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.7 million from $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. We anticipate ground/facility leases expense to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the timing of new ACE projects being placed into service, and the conversion of one owned property to the OCPP structure in January 2019.\nGain (Loss) from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold three owned properties containing 1,338 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $42.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one owned property containing 657 beds, resulting in a net loss from disposition of real estate of approximately $0.6 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $15.3 million for one owned property currently"}
