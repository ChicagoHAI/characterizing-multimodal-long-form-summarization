Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPending Merger with Equity One, Inc.\nOn November 14, 2016, Regency Centers Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Equity One, Inc. ( Equity One\u201d), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Equity One will merge with and into the Regency Centers Corporation, with Regency Centers Corporation being the surviving corporation (the Merger\u201d). The combined company will retain the Regency name and continue to trade under the ticker symbol REG\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d).\nOn the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Equity One issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Equity One owned directly by Equity One or the Regency Centers Corporation and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a newly issued share of the common stock of Regency Centers Corporation.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the requisite approvals from the stockholders of each of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One (which approvals were received at special meetings of the stockholders of each company held on February 24, 2017), the receipt of certain tax opinions by Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is expected to close on March 1, 2017. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the Merger will be completed because completion of the Merger is subject to conditions beyond the control of the Company.\nFor more information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement and related agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nExecuting on our Strategy\nDuring 2016, we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify Regency's position as a leader among shopping center REITs:\nSustain average annual 3% same property NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers.\nWe earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio. Noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2016 include:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We achieved pro-rata same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 3.5%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pro-rata same property percent leased remained high at 96.2% at December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We grew rental rates 11.3% on comparable spaces for new and renewal leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We acquired three operating properties for a gross purchase price of $333.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program.\nWe capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2016, we started $221.4 million of development and redevelopment projects, net of partner funding requirements, with a weighted average projected return of 7.8% upon completion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016, we have six ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $209.3 million, net of partner funding requirements, and have $97.7 million of net costs to complete.

Improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.\nPro-rata Occupancy\nFor the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, \"anchor space\" is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 SF and \"shop space\" is less than 10,000 SF. The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Leased - Operating (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anchor space\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shop space\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes properties in development.\nThe decline in anchor percent leased is due, in part, to the bankruptcy of Sports Authority and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers.

We closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of the tenants in our shopping centers, but also those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from Internet sales. Retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as operating and financing their business, may approach us to modify their lease agreement or file bankruptcy. Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. Currently, no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis. Also, as a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.\nDuring March 2016, Sports Authority filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, at which time we had three leases in our portfolio. One of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed. Those two rejected leases represented $2.1 million, or 0.4%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis; however, we have since executed leases to re-tenant these spaces.\nDuring 2016, Sears Holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of stores. Sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance, and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain. We have five Sears or Kmart leases in our portfolio, which currently represent $3.1 million, or 0.6%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. None of the announced store closures, as of this filing, are within our shopping centers. However, we are currently working to opportunistically re-tenant the spaces as the lease terms permit.\nResults from Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nOur total revenues increased as summarized in the following table:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries from tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management, transaction, and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMinimum rent increased as follows:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$11.9 million increase from rent commencing at development properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$15.3 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7.9 million increase at same properties, reflecting a $9.7 million increase from redevelopments and rental rate growth on new and renewal leases, offset by a $1.8 million charge to straight line rent primarily attributable to expected early terminations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduced by $5.9 million from the sale of operating properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.

However, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a $1.1 million loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held.\nDuring November 2015, we incurred an $8.2 million charge from a make-whole premium on our $100.0 million early redemption of the $400.0 million outstanding 5.875% senior unsecured notes that are due in 2017.\nNet investment income decreased $8.8 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2014 and a $1.1 million decrease in the fair value of plan assets in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, which is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. As the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. The gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the Company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.\nOur equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased (decreased) as follows:\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Regency's Ownership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GRI - Regency, LLC (GRIR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Columbia Regency Retail Partners, LLC (Columbia I)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,709\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Columbia Regency Partners II, LLC (Columbia II)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cameron Village, LLC (Cameron)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RegCal, LLC (RegCal)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US Regency Retail I, LLC (USAA)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments in real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,762\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $8.8 million net decrease is largely attributed to:\nGRIR: $4.4 million increase driven by:\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1.3 million increase in base rent from occupancy and rental rate growth,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1.8 million decrease in depreciation due to higher depreciation expense in 2014 relating to redevelopment activity,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduced interest expense approximately $800,000 by paying off or refinancing property debt at better rates in 2014 and 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Columbia I: $1.8 million decrease from impairment loss upon the sale of one operating property during 2015;\nColumbia II: $424,000 increase due to impairment losses recognized upon the sale of two properties during 2014;

We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing the Company's operating results to other REITs'. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nPro-Rata Same Property NOI:\nOur pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew from the following major components:\nTable 237:

balance sheet and reduce risk, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our targeted investments, and maintain financial flexibility. We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments\nOur Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership. The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units. All debt is issued by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships. Based upon our available sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs. In addition to its $13.3 million of cash, the Company has the following additional sources of capital available:\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ATM equity program (see note 8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original offering amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Forward Equity Offering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original offering amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available equity offering to settle (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Credit (the \"Line\") (see note 6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitment amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available capacity (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>779,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 13, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) We have 1.25 million shares to settle prior to June 23, 2017 at an offering price of $75.25 per share before any underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Net of letters of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3) The Company has the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe operate our business such that we expect net cash flow from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were $222.4 million and $202.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our dividend distribution policy is set by our Board of Directors, who monitors our financial position. Our Board of Directors recently declared a common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, payable on March 1, 2017. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nDuring the next twelve months, we estimate that we will require approximately $240.2 million of cash, including $149.9 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $86.3 million to repay maturing debt, and $4.0 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of maturing debt. If we start new developments, redevelop additional shopping centers, or commit to new acquisitions, our cash requirements will increase. If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. To meet our cash requirements, we may utilize cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of real estate, available borrowings from our Line, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of new long-term debt. These estimated needs reflect Regency's needs as a stand-alone entity and is not meant to reflect or give effect to the pending merger with Equity One.\nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2016, 83.0% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to\nmaintain availability on the Line. Our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 3.3 and 2.8 times for the trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ( Core EBITDA\u201d) divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.\nOur Line, Term Loan, and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are\ndescribed in note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2016 and expect to remain in compliance.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company priced a public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes:\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$350.0 million of 3.6% notes due February 1, 2027, which priced at 99.741%.

In the event that the merger agreement is not consummated, we will be required to redeem these notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$300.0 million of 4.4% notes due February 1, 2047, which priced at 99.110%.

Both of these transactions are contingent upon the consummation of the Merger and are scheduled to close simultaneously with the Merger. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the new term loan to repay existing term loans held by Equity One. The additional line capacity will accommodate the Company's increased property operations and development / redevelopment programs from the Merger.\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(409,671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(139,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(270,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213,211\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $13.7 million due to:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$32.4 million increase in cash from operating income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$3.7 million increase in operating cash flow distributions received from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships as several redevelopment projects were completed and began generating operating cash flows; and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$11.0 million net increase in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities; offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$40.6 million and $7.3 million paid during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to settle forward starting interest rate swaps put in place to hedge changes in interest rates on expected issuance of ten year fixed rate debt.

We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nKnowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.\nAccounts Receivable and Straight Line Rent\nMinimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue. As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical tenant collection rates, write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nReal Estate Investments\nAcquisition of Real Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.\nWe strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. We analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. If it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be VIEs, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive kick-out or participation rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. Management uses its judgment when making these determinations. We use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. Under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDevelopment of Real Estate Assets and Cost Capitalization\nWe capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center.

We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we capitalized interest of $3.5 million, $6.7 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, on our development projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we capitalized $13.0 million, $13.8 million, and $16.1 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.\nValuation of Real Estate Investments\nWe evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.\nWe evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. An investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.\nThe fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings. For additional information on the Company's use and accounting for derivatives, see Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. If a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.\nAs of December 31, 2016 we and our Investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of $8.9 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. Our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. We have no guarantees related to these loans.\nInflation/Deflation\nInflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. Occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.", "summary": "The report discusses Regency Centers Corporation's pending merger with Equity One, Inc.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPending Merger with Equity One, Inc.\nOn November 14, 2016, Regency Centers Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Equity One, Inc. ( Equity One\u201d), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Equity One will merge with and into the Regency Centers Corporation, with Regency Centers Corporation being the surviving corporation (the Merger\u201d). The combined company will retain the Regency name and continue to trade under the ticker symbol REG\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d).\nOn the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Equity One issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Equity One owned directly by Equity One or the Regency Centers Corporation and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a newly issued share of the common stock of Regency Centers Corporation.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the requisite approvals from the stockholders of each of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One (which approvals were received at special meetings of the stockholders of each company held on February 24, 2017), the receipt of certain tax opinions by Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is expected to close on March 1, 2017. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the Merger will be completed because completion of the Merger is subject to conditions beyond the control of the Company.\nFor more information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement and related agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nExecuting on our Strategy\nDuring 2016, we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify Regency's position as a leader among shopping center REITs:\nSustain average annual 3% same property NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers.\nWe earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio. Noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2016 include:\n \u2022 We achieved pro-rata same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 3.5%. \n \u2022 Pro-rata same property percent leased remained high at 96.2% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 We grew rental rates 11.3% on comparable spaces for new and renewal leases. \n \u2022 We acquired three operating properties for a gross purchase price of $333.8 million. \nDevelop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program.\nWe capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.\n \u2022 During 2016, we started $221.4 million of development and redevelopment projects, net of partner funding requirements, with a weighted average projected return of 7.8% upon completion. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2016, we have six ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $209.3 million, net of partner funding requirements, and have $97.7 million of net costs to complete. These developments are projected to return 7.4% on capital upon completion and are currently 78.6% leased. \n \u2022 We also have 15 redevelopments of existing centers in process with total expected net redevelopment costs of $88.4 million, with $59.3 million of costs to complete, and projected incremental returns ranging from 7.0% - 10.0% upon completion. \nCost-effectively enhance our balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns.\nWe fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flows, the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards, equity offerings, new debt financing, and capital from our co-investment partners.\n \u2022 At December 31, 2016, our net debt-to-core EBITDA ratio on a pro-rata basis for the trailing twelve months was 4.4x versus 5.2x at December 31, 2015. We had $13.3 million of cash and $779.2 million available on our line of credit. \n \u2022 In June 2016, we settled 1.85 million of the 3.1 million shares of the forward equity offering resulting in net proceeds of $137.5 million, which were used to partially repay the line of credit balance. \n \u2022 In July 2016, we amended our existing Term Loan, which increased the facility size by $100.0 million to $265.0 million, extended the maturity date to January 5, 2022 and fixed the interest rate at 2.0%. \n \u2022 In July 2016, we issued 5.0 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $400.1 million, used to (i) repay in full our $300.0 million 5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 2017 (\"$300 million note\"), including a make-whole payment, (ii) settle the forward interest rate swaps, and (iii) fund investment activities and general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 In January 2017, we completed a combined $650 million public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes: \n \u2022 $350.0 million of 3.6% notes due February 1, 2027, which priced at 99.741%. The Company intends to use the net proceeds in connection with the consummation of the previously announced pending merger with Equity One, Inc., including (i) to repay approximately $285.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt of Equity One, and any related interest, fees and expenses and (ii) to pay transaction expenses related to the pending merger with Equity One. In the event that the merger agreement is not consummated, we will be required to redeem these notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. \n \u2022 $300.0 million of 4.4% notes due February 1, 2047, which priced at 99.110%. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding shares of its 6.625% Series 6 preferred shares on February 16, 2017 and intends to use the balance to fund investment activities and for general corporate purposes. \nLeasing Activity and Significant Tenants\nWe believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. Improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.\nPro-rata Occupancy\nFor the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, \"anchor space\" is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 SF and \"shop space\" is less than 10,000 SF. The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\n\n(1) Excludes properties in development.\nThe decline in anchor percent leased is due, in part, to the bankruptcy of Sports Authority and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers. See additional discussion below about bankruptcies.\nPro-rata Leasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes leasing activity, including Regency's pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our co-investment partnerships:\n\n\n(1) Number of leasing transactions reported at 100%; all other statistics reported at pro-rata share.\n(2) Totals for base rent, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions reflect the weighted average PSF.\nTotal average base rent signed on our shop space leases of $30.95 increased in 2016 compared to 2015 and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next twelve months of $28.39 PSF by 9%.\nSignificant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk\nWe seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant. The following table summarizes our four most significant tenants, based on their percentage of annualized base rent, each of which is a grocery tenant:\n\n(1) Includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers.\n(2) Includes Regency's pro-rata share of Unconsolidated Properties and excludes those owned by anchors.\nBankruptcies and Credit Concerns\nOur management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, alternative retail methods accessible via the Internet, and demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry. We closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of the tenants in our shopping centers, but also those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from Internet sales. Retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as operating and financing their business, may approach us to modify their lease agreement or file bankruptcy. Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. Currently, no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis. Also, as a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.\nDuring March 2016, Sports Authority filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, at which time we had three leases in our portfolio. One of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed. Those two rejected leases represented $2.1 million, or 0.4%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis; however, we have since executed leases to re-tenant these spaces.\nDuring 2016, Sears Holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of stores. Sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance, and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain. We have five Sears or Kmart leases in our portfolio, which currently represent $3.1 million, or 0.6%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. None of the announced store closures, as of this filing, are within our shopping centers. However, we are currently working to opportunistically re-tenant the spaces as the lease terms permit.\nResults from Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nOur total revenues increased as summarized in the following table:\n\nMinimum rent increased as follows:\n \u2022 $11.9 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; \n \u2022 $15.3 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $7.9 million increase at same properties, reflecting a $9.7 million increase from redevelopments and rental rate growth on new and renewal leases, offset by a $1.8 million charge to straight line rent primarily attributable to expected early terminations; \n \u2022 reduced by $5.9 million from the sale of operating properties. \nRecoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. Recoveries from tenants increased as follows:\n \u2022 $3.9 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; \n \u2022 $4.2 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $5.6 million increase from same properties associated with higher recoverable costs; \n \u2022 reduced by $2.1 million from the sale of operating properties. \nOther income, which consists of incidental income earned at our centers, increased $3.8 million as follows:\n \u2022 $2.3 million in same properties primarily as a result of lease termination and easement fees; and \n \u2022 $1.5 million in parking income related to the acquisition of Market Common Clarendon. \nChanges in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:\n\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased as follows:\n \u2022 $4.8 million increase as we began depreciating costs at development properties where tenant spaces were completed and became available for occupancy; \n \u2022 $8.8 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $5.8 million increase at same properties, attributable to recent capital improvements and redevelopments; \n \u2022 reduced by $3.9 million from the sale of operating properties and other corporate asset disposals. \nOperating and maintenance costs increased as follows:\n \u2022 $2.6 million increase from operations commencing at development properties; \n \u2022 $6.2 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $4.8 million increase at same properties primarily attributable to recoverable costs; \n \u2022 reduced by $1.6 million from the sale of operating properties. \nReal estate taxes increased as follows:\n \u2022 $1.6 million increase from development properties where capitalization ceased as tenant spaces became available for occupancy; \n \u2022 $2.8 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $1.4 million increase at same properties from increased tax assessments; \n \u2022 reduced by $1.3 million from sold properties. \nOther operating expenses increased $6.2 million primarily due to costs incurred from 2016 acquisition activities, including costs associated with the announced pending merger of Equity One, Inc.\nThe following table presents the components of other expense (income):\n\nThe $11.9 million decrease in total interest expense is due to:\n \u2022 $17.2 million decrease in interest on notes payable due to lower interest rates from refinancing and deleveraging activities during 2016 and the early redemption of our $300 million notes in August 2016; offset by \n \u2022 $2.1 million increase in interest on unsecured credit facilities related to higher average balances on our Line and a $100 million increase on our Term Loan during 2016; and \n \u2022 $3.3 million increase due to lower interest capitalization on our development and redevelopment projects based on the status and cumulative spend on the projects in process. \nDuring 2016, we recognized $4.2 million of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels. One of the operating properties and both land parcels have since been sold. We did not recognize any impairments during 2015.\nWe redeemed all of our outstanding $400 million notes in two tranches occurring in 2016 and 2015. During 2016, we recognized a $14.2 million charge when redeeming the $300 million notes. During 2015, we early redeemed $100 million of those same notes, which included an $8.2 million make-whole premium charge.\nNet investment income increased $1.0 million, driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2016.\nWe recognized a $40.6 million charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017. As a result of our July 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the $300 million notes in August 2016, the Company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur. Accordingly, we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the $40.6 million paid to settle the forward starting swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings.\nOur equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows:\n\nThe $34.0 million increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to (i) our share of gains on the sale of real estate within our GRIR, Columbia I, Columbia II, and Other investments in real estate partnerships; (ii) interest expense savings within GRIR resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates; and (iii) and a decrease in depreciation expense within GRIR from fully depreciated land improvement assets.\nThe following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders:\n\nDuring 2016, we sold eleven operating properties and sixteen land parcels resulting in gains of $47.3 million, compared to gains of $35.6 million from the sale of five operating properties and two land parcels during 2015.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur total revenues increased as summarized in the following table:\n\nMinimum rent increased as follows:\n \u2022 $5.0 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; \n \u2022 $9.8 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; and \n \u2022 $15.7 million increase at same properties, with $6.7 million relating to redevelopment properties, and $9.0 million relating to higher rental rates and rent paying occupancy growth; \n \u2022 reduced by $6.0 million from the sale of operating properties. \nRecoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and\nreal estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. Recoveries from tenants increased as follows:\n \u2022 $1.2 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; \n \u2022 $1.5 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; and, \n \u2022 $5.9 million increase from same properties associated with rent paying occupancy improvements and higher recoverable costs; \n \u2022 reduced by $890,000 from the sale of operating properties. \nOther income, which consists of incidental income earned at our centers, decreased primarily as a result of a lower level of settlement and lease termination income earned in 2015.\nWe earn fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows:\n\nAsset and property management fees increased due to higher property values and revenues in our co-investment partnerships. Leasing commissions and other fees increased during 2015 due to the higher average rents on leasing transactions.\nChanges in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:\n\nDepreciation and amortization decreased as follows:\n \u2022 $2.9 million decrease from the sale of operating properties; \n \u2022 $1.9 million increase primarily from operations beginning at development properties and the acquisition of operating properties. \nOperating and maintenance costs increased as follows:\n \u2022 $1.6 million increase from operations commencing at development properties; \n \u2022 $2.1 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; \n \u2022 $2.9 million increase at same properties attributable to an increase in recoverable costs; \n \u2022 reduced by $1.4 million from the sale of operating properties. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased as follows:\n \u2022 $3.9 million of higher compensation costs primarily related to executive management changes during 2015; \n \u2022 $2.3 million of lower development overhead capitalization based on fewer new development and redevelopment projects started in 2015; \n \u2022 reduced by $1.1 million from the decrease in the value of participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan. \nReal estate taxes increased as follows:\n \u2022 $690,000 increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; \n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPending Merger with Equity One, Inc.\nOn November 14, 2016, Regency Centers Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Equity One, Inc. ( Equity One\u201d), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Equity One will merge with and into the Regency Centers Corporation, with Regency Centers Corporation being the surviving corporation (the Merger\u201d). The combined company will retain the Regency name and continue to trade under the ticker symbol REG\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d).\nOn the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Equity One issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Equity One owned directly by Equity One or the Regency Centers Corporation and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a newly issued share of the common stock of Regency Centers Corporation.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the requisite approvals from the stockholders of each of Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One (which approvals were received at special meetings of the stockholders of each company held on February 24, 2017), the receipt of certain tax opinions by Regency Centers Corporation and Equity One, and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is expected to close on March 1, 2017. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the Merger will be completed because completion of the Merger is subject to conditions beyond the control of the Company.\nFor more information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement and related agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nExecuting on our Strategy\nDuring 2016, we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify Regency's position as a leader among shopping center REITs:\nSustain average annual 3% same property NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers.\nWe earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio. Noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2016 include:\n \u2022 We achieved pro-rata same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 3.5%. \n \u2022 Pro-rata same property percent leased remained high at 96.2% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 We grew rental rates 11.3% on comparable spaces for new and renewal leases. \n \u2022 We acquired three operating properties for a gross purchase price of $333.8 million. \nDevelop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program.\nWe capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.\n \u2022 During 2016, we started $221.4 million of development and redevelopment projects, net of partner funding requirements, with a weighted average projected return of 7.8% upon completion. \n \u2022 At December 31, 2016, we have six ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $209.3 million, net of partner funding requirements, and have $97.7 million of net costs to complete. These developments are projected to return 7.4% on capital upon completion and are currently 78.6% leased. \n \u2022 We also have 15 redevelopments of existing centers in process with total expected net redevelopment costs of $88.4 million, with $59.3 million of costs to complete, and projected incremental returns ranging from 7.0% - 10.0% upon completion. \nCost-effectively enhance our balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns.\nWe fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flows, the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards, equity offerings, new debt financing, and capital from our co-investment partners.\n \u2022 At December 31, 2016, our net debt-to-core EBITDA ratio on a pro-rata basis for the trailing twelve months was 4.4x versus 5.2x at December 31, 2015. We had $13.3 million of cash and $779.2 million available on our line of credit. \n \u2022 In June 2016, we settled 1.85 million of the 3.1 million shares of the forward equity offering resulting in net proceeds of $137.5 million, which were used to partially repay the line of credit balance. \n \u2022 In July 2016, we amended our existing Term Loan, which increased the facility size by $100.0 million to $265.0 million, extended the maturity date to January 5, 2022 and fixed the interest rate at 2.0%. \n \u2022 In July 2016, we issued 5.0 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $400.1 million, used to (i) repay in full our $300.0 million 5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 2017 (\"$300 million note\"), including a make-whole payment, (ii) settle the forward interest rate swaps, and (iii) fund investment activities and general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 In January 2017, we completed a combined $650 million public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes: \n \u2022 $350.0 million of 3.6% notes due February 1, 2027, which priced at 99.741%. The Company intends to use the net proceeds in connection with the consummation of the previously announced pending merger with Equity One, Inc., including (i) to repay approximately $285.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt of Equity One, and any related interest, fees and expenses and (ii) to pay transaction expenses related to the pending merger with Equity One. In the event that the merger agreement is not consummated, we will be required to redeem these notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. \n \u2022 $300.0 million of 4.4% notes due February 1, 2047, which priced at 99.110%. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding shares of its 6.625% Series 6 preferred shares on February 16, 2017 and intends to use the balance to fund investment activities and for general corporate purposes. \nLeasing Activity and Significant Tenants\nWe believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. Improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.\nPro-rata Occupancy\nFor the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, \"anchor space\" is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 SF and \"shop space\" is less than 10,000 SF. The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Leased - Operating (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anchor space\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shop space\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes properties in development.\nThe decline in anchor percent leased is due, in part, to the bankruptcy of Sports Authority and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers.

The following table summarizes our four most significant tenants, based on their percentage of annualized base rent, each of which is a grocery tenant:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grocery Anchor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nStores (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCompany-\nowned GLA (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nAnnualized\nBase Rent (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kroger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Publix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Albertsons/Safeway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Whole Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers.\n(2) Includes Regency's pro-rata share of Unconsolidated Properties and excludes those owned by anchors.\nBankruptcies and Credit Concerns\nOur management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, alternative retail methods accessible via the Internet, and demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry. We closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of the tenants in our shopping centers, but also those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from Internet sales. Retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as operating and financing their business, may approach us to modify their lease agreement or file bankruptcy. Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. Currently, no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis. Also, as a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.\nDuring March 2016, Sports Authority filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, at which time we had three leases in our portfolio. One of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed. Those two rejected leases represented $2.1 million, or 0.4%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis; however, we have since executed leases to re-tenant these spaces.\nDuring 2016, Sears Holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of stores. Sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance, and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain. We have five Sears or Kmart leases in our portfolio, which currently represent $3.1 million, or 0.6%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. None of the announced store closures, as of this filing, are within our shopping centers. However, we are currently working to opportunistically re-tenant the spaces as the lease terms permit.\nResults from Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nOur total revenues increased as summarized in the following table:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries from tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management, transaction, and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMinimum rent increased as follows:\n \u2022 $11.9 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; \n \u2022 $15.3 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and \n \u2022 $7.9 million increase at same properties, reflecting a $9.7 million increase from redevelopments and rental rate growth on new and renewal leases, offset by a $1.8 million charge to straight line rent primarily attributable to expected early terminations; \n \u2022 reduced by $5.9 million from the sale of operating properties. \nRecoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.

One of the operating properties and both land parcels have since been sold. We did not recognize any impairments during 2015.\nWe redeemed all of our outstanding $400 million notes in two tranches occurring in 2016 and 2015.

During 2015, we early redeemed $100 million of those same notes, which included an $8.2 million make-whole premium charge.\nNet investment income increased $1.0 million, driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2016.\nWe recognized a $40.6 million charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017. As a result of our July 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the $300 million notes in August 2016, the Company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur. Accordingly, we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the $40.6 million paid to settle the forward starting swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings.\nOur equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Regency's Ownership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GRI - Regency, LLC (GRIR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Columbia Regency Retail Partners, LLC (Columbia I)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Columbia Regency Partners II, LLC (Columbia II)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cameron Village, LLC (Cameron)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RegCal, LLC (RegCal)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US Regency Retail I, LLC (USAA)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments in real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $34.0 million increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to (i) our share of gains on the sale of real estate within our GRIR, Columbia I, Columbia II, and Other investments in real estate partnerships;
