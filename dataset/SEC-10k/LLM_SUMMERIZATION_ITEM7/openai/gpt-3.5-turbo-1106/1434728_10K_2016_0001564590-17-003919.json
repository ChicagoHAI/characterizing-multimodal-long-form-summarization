We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2015 and 2016 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections and re-establishing service on existing previously vacant homes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) had a population of 4.2 million in 2010 and is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S., an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix's growth data continues to improve due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Phoenix Metro will have a population of 4.9 million by 2020 and 6.8 million by 2040. The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity indicates that Arizona's employment rate improved 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the W.P. Carey School of Business, using U.S. Census data, reported that single family housing permits were approximately 16,768 permits for 2015. However, for 2016, permits were estimated to be up approximately 10% to 18,456 permits in Maricopa and Pinal Counties combined, and the forecasts for 2017 and 2018 remain positive at approximately 22,000 permits and 25,000 permits, respectively. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits. Additionally, multifamily, office, retail, and industrial market occupancy rates continued to increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and are expected to continue to increase through 2017.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> population and community growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> economic and environmental utility regulation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> economic environment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the need for infrastructure investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> production and treatment costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> weather and seasonality; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> access to and quality of water supply.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, decreased 718 connections, or 1.9%, from a total of 38,744 as of December 31, 2015 to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley Water Company, Inc. ( Willow Valley\u201d). Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, total service connections increased to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016 from 37,118 as of December 31, 2015, which represents an increase of 908 connections, or an increase of approximately 2.4%.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have 37,387 active service connections compared to 37,784 active service connections as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of 397 or 1.1%. As with the decrease in total service connections, the decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley. Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, active service connections increased 1,115 connections, or 3.1%, to 37,387 as of December 31, 2016 compared to 36,272 as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 98.9% of the 37,387 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company, Inc. ( Valencia\u201d) and the sale of Willow Valley.\nDuring the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.2% of our total connections at the time; however, the negative trend began to reverse thereafter with the number of vacant homes decreasing to 639 or 1.7% of total connections as of December 31, 2016.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether\ncosts were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d), which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our recent settlement with the ACC and extended new rate phase-in period, we will not be initiating the next rate case on this timeline. Moving forward, we will continue to analyze all factors that drive the requirement for increased revenue, including our rate of investment and recurring expenses, and determine the appropriate test year for a future rate case. Refer to - Recent Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and the growth rate of development, especially residential development, since 2006, both nationally and in Arizona has been and continues to be below historical rates. In addition, development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of its permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last thirteen years, and because the infrastructure is new, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan that, we determined through a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service, will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1033 re-investment criteria; however, the timeline to make such investments is limited through the end of 2017. Accordingly, we have accelerated the identified capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019, and beyond. As of December 31, 2016 our deferred tax liability relating to the Valencia condemnation was approximately $17.1 million.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenue are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRecent Rate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC's commissioners before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands):\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Incremental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 183 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nPrior to January 1, 2010, we accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the end water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with the completion of our performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with our ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service to the applicable development or parcel through our regulated subsidiaries.\nThe 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision No. 71878 established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by us that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision by the ACC, we changed our accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January 1, 2010, we recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC again changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, and ICFA funds already received would no longer be deemed CIAC for rate making purposes. In conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, we eliminated the CIAC liability and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by the 2010 ruling. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe now account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and are used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a HUF or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which\nwe may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met.\nWe have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, whereby funds, water line extensions, or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base.\nRecent Events\nReorganization Transaction\nOn January 19, 2016, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. ( GWRC\u201d) announced that it agreed to pursue a reorganization transaction with the Company that resulted in GWRC merging with and into the Company (the Reorganization Transaction\u201d). The Reorganization Transaction closed on May 3, 2016. GWRC was organized in 2010 to acquire shares of the Company, and held an approximate 47.8% interest prior to the merger. The Reorganization Transaction was part of the Company's overall plan to simplify its corporate structure by eliminating one level of holding company ownership, refinance its outstanding tax-exempt bonds on more favorable terms (as described below), improve liquidity for shareholders over the medium- to long-term, and have a single governing jurisdiction in the U.S., where all of the assets, operations, and employees of the business are located. As a result of the merger, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, is the surviving entity.\nDebt Refinancing\nWith the completion of the initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in the U.S. (the U.S. IPO\u201d), the Company had the right to redeem all of its outstanding tax-exempt bonds at a price of 103% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued at the redemption date. Following completion of the IPO, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue two series of senior secured notes with total principal balance of $115.0 million. On June 24, 2016, the Company closed the Note Purchase Agreement, which proceeds were primarily used to pay down the outstanding $106.7 million in tax-exempt bonds at 103%.\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgement of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $108,000 in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Willow Valley\nOn March 23, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to sell the operations and assets of Willow Valley to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. ( EPCOR\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, EPCOR purchased all the operations, assets, and rights used by Willow Valley to operate the utility system for $2.3 million. The transaction was approved by the ACC on March 10, 2016, and closed on May 9, 2016.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we\nrefer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million ($3.1 million of which has been received as of December 31, 2016), which will be paid to us over a multi-year period. Receipt of the remaining proceeds will occur and be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As part of the consideration, we agreed to complete certain engineering work required in the offsite water management agreements, which we completed in 2013, thereby satisfying our remaining obligations relating to the Loop 303 Contracts. In April 2015, we received proceeds of approximately $296,000 related to the sale of the Loop 303 Contracts. As of December 31, 2016, proceeds of $1.0 million remain outstanding, and when received will be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners.\nSonoran Acquisition Liability\nOn March 17, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Sonoran Utility Services, LLC ( Sonoran\u201d) to amend certain provisions of the purchase and sale agreement related to the acquisition of Sonoran's assets on June 15, 2005. The amended agreement allowed the Company to reduce its original $3.8 million acquisition liability due to Sonoran in 2018 to $2.8 million, through a settlement agreement executed subsequent to the Note Purchase Agreement in June 2016. Upon settlement of the Sonoran acquisition liability, the Company recorded a gain of $954,000 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPrivate Letter Ruling\nOn June 2, 2016, the Company received a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the Company under Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033 as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full advantage of the benefits of such ruling. As of December 31, 2016 our deferred tax liability relating to the Valencia condemnation was approximately $17.1 million.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a71033, the Company may defer the gain on condemnation through the end of the year 2017. As such, the Company has identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan, which we have accelerated. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019, and beyond.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 280, Segment Reporting, we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment.\nWhile we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,611\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,855\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,341\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,852\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic earnings (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings (loss) per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Water services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wastewater and recycled water services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unregulated revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues decreased $2.2 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia which occurred in July 2015 and the sale of Willow Valley in May of 2016, which together contributed revenue of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $306,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease related to the condemnation of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley was partially offset by an increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $1.6 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 in February 2014 combined with a 3.1% increase in active service connections (adjusted for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley) combined with an increase in consumption during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was partially offset by a $535,000 reduction in unregulated revenue.\nTotal revenues decreased $603,000, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, which occurred in July 2015, which contributed $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining operating utilities' revenue increased $2.0 million, or 7.5%, reflecting a decrease in precipitation resulting in higher usage of water, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 combined with the increase in rates due to Rate Decision No. 74364 and an increase in active connections.\nWater Services - Water services revenues decreased $2.3 million, or 14.4%, to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $306,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue was partially offset by an increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities of $1.4 million, or 11.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWater services revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 9.7%, to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia contributed $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining operating utilities' water services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $839,000, or 6.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWater services revenue based on consumption decreased $452,000, or 6.8%, to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue related to the condemnation of Valencia and sale of Willow Valley was partially offset by an increase water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $1.2 million, or 23.0%, to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities is related to the onset of new rates in 2016 combined with an increase in active water connections and an increase in consumption compared to 2015.\nWater services revenue based on consumption decreased $1.1 million, or 13.9%, to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in active water connections related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, which contributed $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining operating utilities' consumption revenue increased $234,000, or 4.7%, to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining operating utilities' consumption revenue increased due to the onset of new rates in 2015 combined with an increase in active water connections and am increase in consumption compared to 2014.\nActive water connections decreased 4.8% to 19,013 as of December 31, 2016 from 19,964 as of December 31, 2015 primarily as the result of the sale of Willow Valley. However, after adjusting to remove the active water service connections of Willow Valley, active connections increased 3.0% to 19,013 as of December 31, 2016 from 18,452 as of December 31, 2015.\nActive water connections decreased 23.8% to 19,964 as of December 31, 2015 from 26,188 as of December 31, 2014 as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia. However, after adjusting to remove the active water service connections of Valencia, active connections increased 2.3% to 19,964 as of December 31, 2015 from 19,515 as of December 31, 2014.\nWater consumption decreased 7.8% to 2.2 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.4 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in water consumption was primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which consumed 467 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 17 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2016. The water consumption for the remaining operating utilities increased 13.9% to 2.2 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 1.9 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in consumption can be attributed to the increase in active connections (in each case adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley) combined with an increase in average temperature and a decrease in precipitation for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWater consumption decreased 17.2% to 2.4 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.9 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in consumption was primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia in July 2015, which consumed 410 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 807 million gallons consumed for the year ended December 31, 2014. The water consumption of the remaining operating utilities decreased 4.6% to 2.0 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2.1 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge decreased $1.8 million, or 19.0%, to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in basic water service revenue is primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in basic revenues for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $203,000, or 2.9%, to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting growth in total active connections as well as an increase in rates due to Rate Decision No. 74364.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge decreased $650,000, or 6.6%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia. The basic service charge revenue for the remaining operating utilities increased $641,000, or 9.3%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflecting growth in total active connections as well as an increase in rates due to Rate Decision No. 74364.\nWastewater and Recycled Water Services - Wastewater and recycled water services revenues increased $720,000, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 as well as the increase of active wastewater connections, which increased 3.1% to 18,374 as of December 31, 2016 from 17,820 as of December 31, 2015.\nWastewater and recycled water services revenues increased $908,000, or 6.4%, to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the onset of new rates in 2015 due to Rate Decision No. 74364 combined with an increase in the number of active wastewater connections.\nRecycled water revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $183,000, or 35.9%, to $693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $510,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The recycled water revenue increase is a function of an increase in rates and volume delivered. Recycled water rates increased 30% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2015. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased approximately 3 million gallons, or 0.5%, to 635 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 639 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRecycled water revenue increased $181,000, or 54.8%, to $510,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $330,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The volume of recycled water delivered increased 63 million gallons, or 11.0%, to 639 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 576 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nUnregulated Revenues - Unregulated revenues, which are primarily rental fees derived from leases of space on a utility-owned communications tower and the imputed revenue resulting from our public-private partnership with the City of Maricopa, decreased $535,000, or 86.9%, to $81,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $616,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by the expiration of the temporary arrangement within the public-private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa, wherein we agreed to offset the cash payment of our license fee through December 31, 2015 for certain utility related services we provide to the City of Maricopa. These commitments were satisfied, and the associated license fees were being accounted for as unregulated revenue until the expiration of the temporary arrangement on December 31, 2015.\nUnregulated revenues increased $245,000, or 66.0%, to $616,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $371,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in infrastructure coordination and financing agreement-related imputed revenue resulting from our public-private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa starting in April 2014, wherein we agreed to offset the cash payment of our license fee through December 31, 2015 for certain utility related services the City of Maricopa required from the Company. These commitments were previously finalized, and the associated license fees were accounted for as unregulated revenue until the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses - The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance - related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on regulatory order\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,664\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and Maintenance - Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased power), maintenance costs, contract services, and property tax, decreased $892,000, or 12.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in operations and maintenance costs was primarily driven by the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley.\nOperations and maintenance costs decreased $940,000, or 11.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operations and maintenance costs was primarily driven by the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia.\nTotal personnel costs decreased $386,000, or 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in personnel related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $534,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease in personnel expenses was partially offset by an increase of $88,000, or 5.7%, in personnel expenses of the remaining operating utilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Personnel expense for the remaining operating utilities increased due to an increase in salary and wages related to certain organizational changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal personnel costs decreased $349,000, or 14.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in personnel related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, which contributed $759,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $357,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining operating utilities' personnel costs increased $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nUtilities and power expense decreased $92,000, or 5.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Utilities and power expense decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $222,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in utilities expense was partially offset by an increase in the utility expense of the remaining operating utilities, which increased $117,000, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in utilities expense is primarily related to an increase in consumption.\nUtilities and power expense decreased $358,000, or 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Utilities and power expense decreased as a result of the condemnation of operations and assets of Valencia, which contributed $484,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $193,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Utilities and power expense for the remaining operating utilities decreased $72,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty taxes decreased $272,000, or 13.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Property taxes primarily decreased due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $210,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and zero for the year ended December 31, 2016. Property tax expense decreased for the remaining operating utilities by $61,000, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Property taxes for the remaining utilities decreased as a result of a change in property tax assessment in 2016 compared to 2015. Property taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 did not change significantly when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContract services expense decreased $116,000, or 35.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Contract services decreased as a result of a reduction in disposal fees. Disposal fees decreased $88,000, or 77.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Residual disposal declined due to the elimination of third party transportation expenses related to the transfer of certain disposal activities in-house combined with the elimination of bio-solid disposal fees, as we initiated direct land application of bio-solids in July 2014. Bio-solids are a by-product of our water reclamation process and were previously disposed of within a landfill. Currently, bio-solids are beneficially reused as fertilizer by an agricultural farmer who accepts the bio-solids at no cost. Contract services for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not change significantly when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperations and Maintenance - Related Party - Operations and maintenance related party expenses are for service fees paid to FATHOM\u2122 with respect to billing, customer service and other support provided to our regulated utilities.

FATHOM\u2122 service fees primarily decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which contributed $475,000 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in service fees for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $89,000, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. FATHOM\u2122 service fees for the remaining operating utilities increased in relation to an increase in their active water connections combined with a consumer price index increase in the monthly charge pursuant to the services contract.\nOperations and maintenance related party expenses totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Fathom services fees decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia.\nGeneral and Administrative - General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operation, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent, and regulatory fees. These costs increased $2.3 million, or 28.3%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. General and administrative costs decreased $852,000, or 9.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nPersonnel related costs decreased $670,000, or 19.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 decrease was driven by a non-recurring bonus of $591,000 paid in relation to closing of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia in 2015. Excluding the non-recurring bonus, personnel related costs decreased $79,000, or 2.3%, primarily due to a decrease in medical expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, personnel costs decreased $1.0 million, or 19.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Personnel costs decreased as a result of a decline in wage and bonus expense combined with a decrease in deferred compensation. Salary, bonus, and benefit expense decreased $514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in salary, bonus, and benefit expense is primarily due to a decrease of approximately $821,000 related to the completion of our executive transition plan, wherein we no longer accrue and pay a salary and bonus to Mr. Hill and Ms. Bowers, each of who transitioned to directors of the Company in 2015. The decrease related to our executive transition plan is inclusive of $300,000 of cash bonus payments made in lieu of phantom stock units ( PSUs\u201d) in 2014 that did not occur in 2015, which were made to reduce the potential exposure to an increase in deferred compensation expense resulting from PSU re-measurement corresponding to an increase in share price. This decrease is partially offset by a one-time bonus of $591,000 for members of management holding stock appreciation rights at the time of the special dividend paid out in August 2015, combined with a $65,000 increase in labor capitalized to ongoing projects.\nDeferred compensation costs increased $1.1 million, or 158.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Deferred compensation increased as a result of the change in our stock price, which increased $3.60 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a U.S. Dollar adjusted stock price increase of $0.97 for the year ended December 31, 2015, combined with the continued vesting of outstanding PSUs and SARs. PSUs and SARs derive their value from the value of one outstanding share of stock. Deferred compensation is recorded upon the vesting of these awards. Outstanding vested units are revalued periodically based upon the change in unit price as derived from the change in stock price.\nDeferred compensation decreased $587,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Deferred compensation decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in the total number of PSUs outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The U.S. Dollar adjusted share price increased $0.97 for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCity of Maricopa memorandum of understanding fees increased $316,000 or 57.8%, to $863,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $547,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Previously, we agreed to offset the cash payments associated with the license fees through December 31, 2015 with miscellaneous utility related services provided by us to the City of Maricopa. Beginning in January 2016, we began paying the City of Maricopa for the license fees calculated at 3% of revenues of Palo Verde Utility Company and Santa Cruz Water Company. City of Maricopa memorandum of understanding fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 did not change significantly when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRegulatory expenses increased $154,000, or 205.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in regulatory expense was due to amortization of deferred rate case costs incurred during the latest rate case that resulted in Rate Decision No. 74364. Amortization of the deferred rate case costs began in January 2015 in conjunction with the onset of new rates. Regulatory expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not change significantly when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProfessional fees, which include legal and accounting costs, increased $49,000, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Professional fees increased primarily as a result of a $214,000 increase in legal expenses associated with being a U.S. publicly traded company, which expenses were historically recorded at GWRC, combined with an increase associated with the Private Letter Ruling. These increases were partially offset by a $165,000 decrease in accounting and other services, which decreased as part of a reduction in expenses related to audit and tax services combined with a reduction in certain other consulting arrangements.\nProfessional fees decreased $76,000, or 5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as certain accounting and legal fees related to Rate Decision No. 74364 were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 that did not occur in 2015.\nBoard compensation costs increased $1.0 million, or 259.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in board compensation is primarily related to $649,000 in stock option expense associated with the 2016 option grant for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, board compensation expense increased as a result of the change in stock price, which increased $3.60 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the U.S. Dollar adjusted increase of $0.97 for the year ended December 31, 2015, combined with an increase in the number of deferred phantom units ( DPUs\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nBoard compensation increased $238,000, or 154.3%, to $392,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Board compensation increased due to the completion of the executive transition plan in 2015, wherein Mr. Hill and Ms. Bowers began being compensated as board members rather than employees. In addition to the transition plan, board compensation was also affected by an approximately $44,000 in DPUs awarded to certain board members in conjunction with the one-time dividend paid out in August 2015 in relation to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia.\nMiscellaneous expenses increased $210,000 or 85.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily related to an increase in the taxes and fees associated with the completion of the U.S. IPO and our status as a U.S. publicly traded company, of which a portion of these expenses were historically recorded at GWRC.\nGain on Regulatory Order - The $50.7 million gain on regulatory order recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the benefit to the Company's periodic earnings as a result of Rate Decision No. 74364, which concluded that infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds received historically would no longer be recorded as contributions in aid of construction.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense decreased by $1.9 million, or 23.5%, to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, which recorded depreciation of approximately $63,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 in addition to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives and, therefore, having been fully depreciated.\nDepreciation expense decreased by $992,000, or 10.8%, to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.2 million the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of depreciation expense is primarily due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia combined with some of our assets reaching their full useful life and, therefore, having been fully depreciated.\nOther Income (Expense) - Other expense totaled a net $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net other income of $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in other expense is primarily driven by the $43.0 million gain associated with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia recorded in 2015 combined with a $3.6 million increase in interest expense in 2016. The increase in net expense in 2016 was partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in other income.\nInterest expense increased 43.0% to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased due to the refinancing of debt that was completed in June of 2016. As part of the refinancing, we paid $3.2 million in prepayment penalties and wrote off the remaining $2.2 million in capitalized loan fees related to the retired bonds. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rate expense in the second half of 2016 related to the refinancing of our bonds in June 2016.\nOther income increased to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to income of $767,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in other income was primarily attributed to a $954,000 gain on the settlement of the Sonoran purchase liability. The Sonoran liability was originally due in June 2018, however, by accelerating the payoff of the liability, we were able to reduce the original liability of $3.8 million to $2.8 million. Additionally, other income includes approximately $1.2 million related to the Valencia earn out for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $624,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, wherein we receive $3,000 for each new meter installed in the Valencia service area. These gains were partially offset by a $54,000 loss on sale of Willow Valley Water Company in May of 2016 combined with a reduction in other income related to the 2015 gain of $296,000 on proceeds received in relation to the sale of Loop 303 Contracts.\nOther income totaled a net $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net other expense of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income (expense) primarily consisted of the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, interest expense, loss on equity method investment and other income. The $42.3 million change in other income is primarily attributed to the $43.0 million gain recorded in 2015 with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia combined with $624,000 of income attributed to the Valencia earn out, wherein we receive $3,000 for each new meter installed within our prior service area over a 20-year period, beginning January 1, 2015. The gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia was partially offset by $2.0 million of interest income related to the Sierra Negra Ranch, LLC litigation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was not recorded in 2015.\nLoss on equity method investment, recorded to other income (expense)-related party on the consolidated statements of operations, decreased $473,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the reduction in the Company's share of ongoing losses, which declined as a result of the recapitalization of Fathom Water Management Holdings, LLP in November 2014. Equity method losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not change significantly when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Tax Benefit - An income tax benefit of $1.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit is related to our current period losses.\nIncome tax expense increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a benefit of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in income tax expense is driven by the $20.2 million tax expense related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a $16.1 million tax benefit\nrelated to the reversal of substantially all the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of Rate Decision No. 74364.\nEffective June 2012 and through December 31, 2013, the Company maintained a full income tax valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the additional revenues expected to be provided by Rate Decision No. 74364, as well as other factors, the Company performed an evaluation of its deferred tax assets and determined that sufficient evidence existed such that the majority of the Company's deferred tax assets would be utilized in the future. Accordingly, the Company reversed substantially all of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously recorded, resulting in a $16.1 million income tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded an $868,000 income tax benefit related to current year losses.\nNet Loss - Our net loss totaled $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net income of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $24.2 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributed to the $43.0 million gain on the condemnation of operations and assets of Valencia, net of a $20.2 million tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, interest expense increased $3.6 million and deferred compensation and board compensation increased $2.1 million. Interest expense increased due to the expenses associated with our debt refinancing. Deferred compensation increased primarily due to an increases in stock price, combined with option grants to members of the board. The amounts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $1.5 million related to our current period losses.\nNet income totaled $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributed to the $43.0 million gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, net of a $20.2 million tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the $50.7 million gain on regulatory order, $16.1 million release of income tax asset valuation allowance and interest income of $2.0 million related to the resolution of certain litigation recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 that did not occur in 2015. Additionally, the Company recognized approximately $296,000 of income from proceeds related to the sale of Loop 303 Contracts along with a $176,000 loss in conjunction with the classification of Willow Valley's assets as held for sale, which did not occur in 2014.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of March 10, 2017, there were 19,581,266 shares of our common stock outstanding and options to acquire an additional 368,395 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders, and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fund operating costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> pay dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> make debt and interest payments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> invest in new and existing ventures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited; such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have one notable near-term cash expenditure obligation related to an estimated $178,000 tax liability associated with the GWRC merger. We have no notable near-term debt obligations. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. On November 14, 2016 we announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.022 per share ($0.264 per share annually) to $0.0225 per share ($0.27 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements.\nThe senior secured notes contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if we fall below a debt service ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of 1.25, or 1.20 for the quarters ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest, and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments, dividend declarations and stock repurchases. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our dividend covenant, and we believe we will remain in compliance for at least the next twelve months.\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, and weather and seasonality.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.9 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $2.4 million change in cash from operating activities is primarily driven by an increase in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This loss was primarily driven by the $3.2 million prepayment penalty on the retirement of our tax exempt bonds.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively. The $7.4 million change in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by $2.8 million of infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds and $2.0 million of interest in connection with the settlement of the Sierra Negra Ranch, LLC litigation, received for the year ended December 31, 2014 and not for 2015. Additionally, cash from operations was affected by a $1.4 million payout of accrued PSU expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFurther, operating cash flows are affected by the timing of the recording and settlement of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.\nCash Used In Investing Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $52.0 million cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $58.1 million change was primarily driven by $55.1 million in proceeds received in relation to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia in 2015. In addition, capital expenditures increased $5.2 million to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by the $2.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Willow Valley.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's net cash provided by investing activities totaled $52.0 million compared to $1.4 million in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $53.4 million change was primarily driven by the $55.2 million in proceeds received in relation to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and $296,000 in proceeds from the sale of Loop 303 Contracts received during the year ended December 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model and as service connections grow. This includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. We expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017 as compared to recent years as a result of our decision to accelerate certain capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan related to the recently obtained Private Letter Ruling (see -Recent Events-Private Letter Ruling\u201d), which provides that water reclamation facility improvements are similar or related in service or use, which capital improvements would defer a portion of the tax gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia. Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\nCash Used In Financing Activities\nOur net cash provided by financing activities totaled $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $64.5 million change as compared to the $51.3 million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. This change was primarily driven by the refinancing of tax exempt bonds, wherein we repaid $106.7 million in tax exempt bonds with $115.0 million in proceeds from our two series of senior secured notes, combined with the release of $8.8 million in bond reserves associated with the refinancing. Additionally, we generated $5.5 million in net proceeds from our recently completed U.S. IPO. Proceeds received for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by the $2.8 million payment to settle our Sonoran acquisition liability, combined\nwith $5.0 million in dividends paid. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by $27.6 million in dividends paid and $21.7 million in loan repayments of which $21.3 million was associated with the retirement of the MidFirst loan.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company's net cash used in financing activities totaled $51.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively. The $45.7 million increase in cash used in financing activities was principally driven by $21.3 million in cash used to retire our term loan with MidFirst Bank in July 2015 combined with an increase of $24.2 million in the amount of dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $22.8 million of the increase is related to a special one-time cash dividend paid on August 12, 2015.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn June 24, 2016, we closed the Note Purchase Agreement entered into on May 20, 2016 and issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to refinance the existing long-term tax exempt bonds, pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the U.S. IPO.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe carry various property, casualty, and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles, and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions, and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions, and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions, and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. The Company's assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of the Company's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, the Company would be required to recognize fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would increase the income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements is included footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\") Accounting Election and Other Matters\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can elect to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We chose to take advantage of this extended transition provision. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock-Our election to take advantage of the JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may make our financial statements more difficult to compare to other public companies\u201d and Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock-Taking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nThe Company historically accounted for stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d) as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710, Compensation - General, valued using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d), for nonpublic entities. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs. While the SARs will continue to be remeasured at each quarterly reporting date, the SARs are required to be accounted for prospectively at fair value using a fair value pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The effect of the change increased the SAR liability by $103,000 which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. An offsetting change to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation, net of $38,000 in taxes. Any future changes in fair value will be recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.", "summary": "The management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations report for Global Water Resources, Inc. provides an overview of the company's activities and outlook. The report discusses the company's integrated approach, called \"Total Water Management,\" which aims to manage the entire water cycle and promote sustainable communities. It also highlights the company's positive growth trends, population and community growth, regulatory factors, infrastructure investment, and factors affecting its operations.

We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2015 and 2016 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections and re-establishing service on existing previously vacant homes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) had a population of 4.2 million in 2010 and is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S., an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix's growth data continues to improve due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Phoenix Metro will have a population of 4.9 million by 2020 and 6.8 million by 2040. The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity indicates that Arizona's employment rate improved 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the W.P. Carey School of Business, using U.S. Census data, reported that single family housing permits were approximately 16,768 permits for 2015. However, for 2016, permits were estimated to be up approximately 10% to 18,456 permits in Maricopa and Pinal Counties combined, and the forecasts for 2017 and 2018 remain positive at approximately 22,000 permits and 25,000 permits, respectively. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits. Additionally, multifamily, office, retail, and industrial market occupancy rates continued to increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and are expected to continue to increase through 2017.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n \u2022 population and community growth; \n \u2022 economic and environmental utility regulation; \n \u2022 economic environment; \n \u2022 the need for infrastructure investment; \n \u2022 production and treatment costs; \n \u2022 weather and seasonality; and \n \u2022 access to and quality of water supply. \nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, decreased 718 connections, or 1.9%, from a total of 38,744 as of December 31, 2015 to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley Water Company, Inc. ( Willow Valley\u201d). Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, total service connections increased to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016 from 37,118 as of December 31, 2015, which represents an increase of 908 connections, or an increase of approximately 2.4%.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have 37,387 active service connections compared to 37,784 active service connections as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of 397 or 1.1%. As with the decrease in total service connections, the decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley. Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, active service connections increased 1,115 connections, or 3.1%, to 37,387 as of December 31, 2016 compared to 36,272 as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 98.9% of the 37,387 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company, Inc. ( Valencia\u201d) and the sale of Willow Valley.\nDuring the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.2% of our total connections at the time; however, the negative trend began to reverse thereafter with the number of vacant homes decreasing to 639 or 1.7% of total connections as of December 31, 2016.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether\ncosts were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d), which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our recent settlement with the ACC and extended new rate phase-in period, we will not be initiating the next rate case on this timeline. Moving forward, we will continue to analyze all factors that drive the requirement for increased revenue, including our rate of investment and recurring expenses, and determine the appropriate test year for a future rate case. Refer to - Recent Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and the growth rate of development, especially residential development, since 2006, both nationally and in Arizona has been and continues to be below historical rates. In addition, development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of its permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last thirteen years, and because the infrastructure is new, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan that, we determined through a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service, will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1033 re-investment criteria; however, the timeline to make such investments is limited through the end of 2017. Accordingly, we have accelerated the identified capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019, and beyond. As of December 31, 2016 our deferred tax liability relating to the Valencia condemnation was approximately $17.1 million.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenue are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRecent Rate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC's commissioners before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands):\n\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 183 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nPrior to January 1, 2010, we accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the end water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with the completion of our performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with our ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service to the applicable development or parcel through our regulated subsidiaries.\nThe 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision No. 71878 established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by us that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision by the ACC, we changed our accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January 1, 2010, we recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC again changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, and ICFA funds already received would no longer be deemed CIAC for rate making purposes. In conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, we eliminated the CIAC liability and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by the 2010 ruling. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe now account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and are used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a HUF or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which\nwe may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met.\nWe have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, whereby funds, water line extensions, or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base.\nRecent Events\nReorganization Transaction\nOn January 19, 2016, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. ( GWRC\u201d) announced that it agreed to pursue a reorganization transaction with the Company that resulted in GWRC merging with and into the Company (the Reorganization Transaction\u201d). The Reorganization Transaction closed on May 3, 2016. GWRC was organized in 2010 to acquire shares of the Company, and held an approximate 47.8% interest prior to the merger. The Reorganization Transaction was part of the Company's overall plan to simplify its corporate structure by eliminating one level of holding company ownership, refinance its outstanding tax-exempt bonds on more favorable terms (as described below), improve liquidity for shareholders over the medium- to long-term, and have a single governing jurisdiction in the U.S., where all of the assets, operations, and employees of the business are located. As a result of the merger, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, is the surviving entity.\nDebt Refinancing\nWith the completion of the initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in the U.S. (the U.S. IPO\u201d), the Company had the right to redeem all of its outstanding tax-exempt bonds at a price of 103% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued at the redemption date. Following completion of the IPO, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue two series of senior secured notes with total principal balance of $115.0 million. On June 24, 2016, the Company closed the Note Purchase Agreement, which proceeds were primarily used to pay down the outstanding $106.7 million in tax-exempt bonds at 103%.\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgement of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $108,000 in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Willow Valley\nOn March 23, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to sell the operations and assets of Willow Valley to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. ( EPCOR\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, EPCOR purchased all the operations, assets, and rights used by Willow Valley to operate the utility system for $2.3 million. The transaction was approved by the ACC on March 10, 2016, and closed on May 9, 2016.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we\nrefer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million ($3.1 million of which has been received as of December 31, 2016), which will be paid to us over a multi-year period. Receipt of the remaining proceeds will occur and be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As part of the consideration, we agreed to complete certain engineering work required in the offsite water management agreements, which we completed in 2013, thereby satisfying our remaining obligations relating to the Loop 303", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of Global Water Resources, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with United States ( U.S.\u201d) generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented in U.S. dollars and references to $\u201d, US$\u201d, and dollars\u201d are to U.S. dollars.\nOverview\nWe are a water resource management company that owns, operates, and manages water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as \"Total Water Management,\" a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water, and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.\nBusiness Outlook\n2015 and 2016 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections and re-establishing service on existing previously vacant homes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA\u201d) had a population of 4.2 million in 2010 and is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S., an increase of 29% over the 3.3 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix's growth data continues to improve due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Phoenix Metro will have a population of 4.9 million by 2020 and 6.8 million by 2040. The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity indicates that Arizona's employment rate improved 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the W.P. Carey School of Business, using U.S. Census data, reported that single family housing permits were approximately 16,768 permits for 2015. However, for 2016, permits were estimated to be up approximately 10% to 18,456 permits in Maricopa and Pinal Counties combined, and the forecasts for 2017 and 2018 remain positive at approximately 22,000 permits and 25,000 permits, respectively. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits. Additionally, multifamily, office, retail, and industrial market occupancy rates continued to increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and are expected to continue to increase through 2017.\nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n \u2022 population and community growth; \n \u2022 economic and environmental utility regulation; \n \u2022 economic environment; \n \u2022 the need for infrastructure investment; \n \u2022 production and treatment costs; \n \u2022 weather and seasonality; and \n \u2022 access to and quality of water supply. \nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, decreased 718 connections, or 1.9%, from a total of 38,744 as of December 31, 2015 to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley Water Company, Inc. ( Willow Valley\u201d). Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, total service connections increased to 38,026 as of December 31, 2016 from 37,118 as of December 31, 2015, which represents an increase of 908 connections, or an increase of approximately 2.4%.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have 37,387 active service connections compared to 37,784 active service connections as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of 397 or 1.1%. As with the decrease in total service connections, the decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley. Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, active service connections increased 1,115 connections, or 3.1%, to 37,387 as of December 31, 2016 compared to 36,272 as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 98.9% of the 37,387 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde\u201d) utilities.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company, Inc. ( Valencia\u201d) and the sale of Willow Valley.\nDuring the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.2% of our total connections at the time; however, the negative trend began to reverse thereafter with the number of vacant homes decreasing to 639 or 1.7% of total connections as of December 31, 2016.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether\ncosts were prudently incurred, and to set just and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC\u201d), which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been prudently invested\u201d and used and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a rate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding prudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or basic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our recent settlement with the ACC and extended new rate phase-in period, we will not be initiating the next rate case on this timeline. Moving forward, we will continue to analyze all factors that drive the requirement for increased revenue, including our rate of investment and recurring expenses, and determine the appropriate test year for a future rate case. Refer to - Recent Rate Case Activity\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and the growth rate of development, especially residential development, since 2006, both nationally and in Arizona has been and continues to be below historical rates. In addition, development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our used and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of its permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last thirteen years, and because the infrastructure is new, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we have identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan that, we determined through a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service, will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1033 re-investment criteria; however, the timeline to make such investments is limited through the end of 2017. Accordingly, we have accelerated the identified capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019, and beyond. As of December 31, 2016 our deferred tax liability relating to the Valencia condemnation was approximately $17.1 million.\nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenue are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.\nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see Risk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRecent Rate Case Activity\nOn July 9, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC's commissioners before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands):\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Incremental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues.\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 183 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nPrior to January 1, 2010, we accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the end water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with the completion of our performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with our ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service to the applicable development or parcel through our regulated subsidiaries.\nThe 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision No. 71878 established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by us that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision by the ACC, we changed our accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January 1, 2010, we recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC again changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, and ICFA funds already received would no longer be deemed CIAC for rate making purposes. In conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, we eliminated the CIAC liability and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by the 2010 ruling. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording more or less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\nWe now account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator's perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and are used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a HUF or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which\nwe may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met.\nWe have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, whereby funds, water line extensions, or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements' refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base.\nRecent Events\nReorganization Transaction\nOn January 19, 2016, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. ( GWRC\u201d) announced that it agreed to pursue a reorganization transaction with the Company that resulted in GWRC merging with and into the Company (the Reorganization Transaction\u201d). The Reorganization Transaction closed on May 3, 2016. GWRC was organized in 2010 to acquire shares of the Company, and held an approximate 47.8% interest prior to the merger. The Reorganization Transaction was part of the Company's overall plan to simplify its corporate structure by eliminating one level of holding company ownership, refinance its outstanding tax-exempt bonds on more favorable terms (as described below), improve liquidity for shareholders over the medium- to long-term, and have a single governing jurisdiction in the U.S., where all of the assets, operations, and employees of the business are located. As a result of the merger, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, is the surviving entity.\nDebt Refinancing\nWith the completion of the initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in the U.S. (the U.S. IPO\u201d), the Company had the right to redeem all of its outstanding tax-exempt bonds at a price of 103% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued at the redemption date. Following completion of the IPO, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue two series of senior secured notes with total principal balance of $115.0 million. On June 24, 2016, the Company closed the Note Purchase Agreement, which proceeds were primarily used to pay down the outstanding $106.7 million in tax-exempt bonds at 103%.\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgement of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $108,000 in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nSale of Willow Valley\nOn March 23, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to sell the operations and assets of Willow Valley to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. ( EPCOR\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, EPCOR purchased all the operations, assets, and rights used by Willow Valley to operate the utility system for $2.3 million. The transaction was approved by the ACC on March 10, 2016, and closed on May 9, 2016.\nSale of Loop 303 Contracts\nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we\nrefer to collectively as the Loop 303 Contracts\u201d), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the Loop 303 Corridor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million ($3.1 million of which has been received as of December 31, 2016), which will be paid to us over a multi-year period. Receipt of the remaining proceeds will occur and be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As part of the consideration, we agreed to complete certain engineering work required in the offsite water management agreements, which we completed in 2013, thereby satisfying our remaining obligations relating to the Loop 303"}
