The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nEach of the terms the Company,\u201d Identiv,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nOverview\nIdentiv is a global security technology company that secures and manages access to physical places, things and information. Global organizations across government, education, retail, transportation, healthcare and other markets rely upon our solutions. We empower them to create secure and convenient experiences in schools, government offices, stores, banks, critical infrastructure, transportation, hospitals and virtually every type of facility and for a wide range of products.\nOur operating segments focus on the following solutions:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Physical security and customer insight solutions, securing buildings via an integrated access control system, included in our Premises (formerly referred to as PACS\u201d) segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Information security solutions, securing enterprise information access and secure transactions across PCs, networks, email, login, secure payments and printers via delivery of smart card reader products, included in our Identity segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Radio frequency identification ( RFID\u201d) based solutions for use in a wide range of applications from asset tracking to product authenticity, customer engagement, product instrumentation, transportation access and other applications sometimes included in the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d). The RFID devices are embedded into access cards, transponders and other embedded devices that enable frictionless access to and interaction with the physical world.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe foundation of our business is our deep technical expertise in RFID, smart card technology, and physical security technologies. Our close customer relationships and analytics platforms allow us to develop customer-relevant products and applications. This is all underpinned by our core value of uncompromising quality.\nTo deliver our solutions, we have organized our operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials, and All Other.\nPremises\nThe foundation of our physical security platform has been the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and a wide range of integrations that provide Velocity/MX's unique flexibility across a wide range of industries and implementations. We have further extended our physical access platform with our Identiv Connected Physical Access Manager ( ICPAM\u201d) software, derived from Cisco's Physical Access Manager ( CPAM\u201d) system and available in partnership with Cisco. Additionally, we sell either individual components or complete bundled solutions which can include any or all among software, edge controllers, multi-door panels, access readers, access cards and other components.\nOur modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nTo our price/performance/quality-leading commercial offerings, we have added what we believe to be the highest performance, lowest per-door cost access control system for the U.S. federal government security mandate known as the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management ( FICAM\u201d) architecture. This brings all of the advantages above into the next generation of physical security for the U.S. government departments and agencies to achieve Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS\u201d) 201 compliance.\nOur TouchSecure ( TS\u201d) door readers provide unique features to support a wide range of security standards. We support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication (\"NFC\") and government-issued credentials including Common Access Card ( CAC\u201d), Personal Verification Identification ( PIV\u201d), Personal Verification Identification - Interoperable ( PIV-I\u201d) and others. Additionally, our Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered, and providing both secure two-factor authentication and convenient alternative-factor access.\nIn addition to this solution offering, in 2017, we launched Identiv Global Services ( IGS\u201d), a service offering with a comprehensive catalog of end-to-end services that facilitates customer success and drives deeper adoption of the Identiv product portfolio. IGS supports customers throughout their premises security lifecycle from system design, to deployment to managed services. IGS experts enable customers to address today's complex security and IT systems interoperability requirements, and helps them achieve a tailor-made set-up.\nIn February 2018, we acquired 3VR Security, Inc. ( 3VR\u201d), a video technology and analytics company. Our new offerings include video intelligence solutions which provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems' capabilities seamlessly.\nIn addition to our core products, we have a range of product initiatives to leverage leading technology advances across mobile, biometric, machine-learning and other areas, to provide convenient, frictionless, low-cost yet highly secure physical access. We invest independently and in partnership with other leading technology companies in these emerging aspects of physical security and analytics platforms.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical access (i.e., PC, network or data access) and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nWith over 20 years of smart card reader, application and token experience, we are known for our expertise in this complex ecosystem. We combine our deep technical expertise with an optimized supply chain, to provide the most optimal, cost-effective and high-quality smart card-based products. Whether Identiv branded products, original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) branded, or embedded chips or modules, our position is as the trusted business solution provider for all users and issuers of smart cards and embedded-chip applications.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials segment includes NFC and RFID products, including inlays and inlay\u00adbased and other cards, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and integrated circuits ( IC\u201d) components and our generally grouped into access cards and transponders. Our TS Cards product line, we believe, is the first complete solution to allow customers to pay only for the most basic low-frequency proximity access technology while having the ability to evolve to the higher-security high-frequency and highest-security public key infrastructure ( PKI\u201d) based access credentials. This product line exemplifies our values: we place no burden on our customers, instead providing the most cost-effective solution to their basic needs; and then delivering within this platform the ability for them to move to higher-level needs and capabilities, when they want, when they are ready and when they will realize economic and experience benefits.\nOur transponder products span the full range of high frequency ( HF\u201d) and ultra-high frequency ( UHF\u201d) technologies. Our differentiation is analogous to application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICS\u201d) in the semiconductor market. We leverage our flexible platform, our deep technical expertise and our infrastructure and supply chain to deliver solutions optimized for our customers' business goals. We believe we are more responsive, more flexible, more experienced in business-optimized solutions and have a better track record of sustained delivery of solution-specific, high-quality RFID devices than our competitors. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment such as virtual reality ( VR\u201d), games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management, cold-chain management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we are developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the IoT, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment included legacy product lines, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. No revenues from this segment were generated in 2017 and no revenues are expected to be generated in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we phased out our Digital Media product lines and discontinued our Chipdrive product line.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or OEMs. We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 9, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2017 was $60.2 million, an increase of 7% compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Approximately 40% of our net revenue came from our Premises segment. Net revenue in our Premises segment was $24.2 million in 2017 compared to $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Identity segment, which represented approximately 24% of total net revenue, was $14.3 million in 2017 compared with $12.9 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Credentials segment represented approximately 36% of our net revenue. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2017 was $21.8 million compared with $18.0 million in 2016.\nNet revenue in the Americas\nNet revenue in the Americas was $40.0 million in 2017, accounting for 67% of total net revenue, up 5% compared with $38.1 million in 2016. Net revenue from our Premises solution for security programs within various U.S. government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags represented approximately 54% of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment in the Americas in 2017 was comparable to 2016 primarily due to higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, offset by lower sales of physical access control readers. Net revenue from our Identity segment decreased 24% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to lower smart card reader sales. Net revenue in our Credentials segment increased 33% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher RFID and NFC transponder and access card sales.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive ( HSPD\u201d) 12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our solution for trusted physical access is an attractive offering to help federal agency customers move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders sourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and our sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was approximately $20.2 million in 2017, accounting for 33% of total net revenue, an increase of approximately 12% compared with 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales in the Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower sales in the Europe and the Middle East regions. Net revenue in these regions are dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Premises products decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to lower sales of physical access control solutions in the Europe and Middle East regions, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Net revenue from our Identity products increased approximately 39% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher sales of smart card readers in both regions. Identity reader sales in 2017 and 2016 comprised approximately 49% and 40% of the net revenue throughout these regions, respectively. Net revenue from our Credentials products in 2017, which comprised approximately 38% of sales in these regions, increased 4% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of higher RFID and NFC transponder product sales in both regions.\nSeasonality and Other Factors\nIn our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e., research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) decreased 16% in 2017 compared with 2016. Research and development spending decreased by 6% in 2017 compared with 2017 resulting from restructuring initiatives undertaken in the first quarter of 2016 and additional headcount reductions in 2017, partially offset by higher product certification costs. Selling and marketing spending in 2017 decreased by 4% compared with 2016, due to cost saving initiatives taken in the sales and marketing organization reducing marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2017 decreased by 36% compared with 2016 primarily due to lower legal and professional fees, reimbursements received from an insurance provider for legal fees incurred related to legal proceedings, and credits received from service providers for legal fees invoiced in prior periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue and segment net profit information by business segment and reconciles gross profit to results of operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest.\nThe following table sets forth our

compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Net revenue was higher in 2017 primarily driven by higher sales in our Identity and Credentials segments. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2017 was comparable with 2016. A more detailed discussion of net revenue by segment follows below.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment of $24.2 million in 2017 was comparable with $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue from higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, were offset by lower sales of physical access control readers.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment of $14.3 million in 2017 increased 11% from $12.9 million in 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales of smart card readers in the Europe and the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, partially offset by lower smart card reader sales in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $21.8 million in 2017, an increase of 21% from $18.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher RFID and NFC transponder sales and in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions. In addition, sales of access card products increased 27% in the Americas, slightly offset by lower access card product sales in Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2017 was $22.2 million, or 37% of net revenue, compared to $23.7 million or 42% of net revenue in 2016. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $13.7 million in 2017 and $14.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were 57% in 2017 and in 2016.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as credential provisioning and management services was $5.1 million in 2017 compared to $5.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins were lower in 2017 at 36% compared with 39% in 2016 primarily due to Identity product sales to international customers with lower margins.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of physical access credentials and authenticity and tracking applications was $3.4 million in 2017 compared with $4.4 million in 2016. Gross profit in the Credentials segment was lower primarily due to a transponder related inventory reserve adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with a customer relationship which ended at the end of 2015 and our decision to discontinue plans for alternate use of the product. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment were lower in 2017 at 15% compared with 25% in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of lower margin sales and the transponder related inventory reserve adjustment described above.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products.

The restructuring plan included reducing our non-manufacturing employee base, reallocating overhead roles into direct business activities and eliminating certain management and executive roles. As a result, we incurred $3.1 million in restructuring costs and severance costs in 2016. In 2017, we recorded a credit resulting from actual expenditures being less than originally accrued.\nSee Note 10, Restructuring and Severance, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInformation about our non-operating income (expense) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is set forth below.\nInterest Expense, Net\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,590\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (788\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (788\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities and interest accretion expense for a liability to a long-term payment obligation arising from our acquisition of Hirsch Electronics Corporation ( Hirsch\u201d). The higher net interest expense in 2017 is attributable to higher interest costs related to our debt facility, partially offset by lower debt levels compared to 2016.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our debt facility with a lender and entered into new credit facilities with East West Bank ( EWB\u201d) and Venture Lending & Leasing VII, Inc. and Venture Lending & Leasing VIII, Inc. (collectively referred to as VLL7 and VLL8\u201d), resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million representing the difference between the reacquisition price of the existing debt facility and its net carrying amount. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we paid down $5.0 million of the $10.0 million outstanding term loan payable to VLL7 and VLL8, resulting in the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million.\nSee Note 6, Long-Term Payment Obligation and Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nForeign Currency Gains (Losses), Net\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (385\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1425.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in currency valuation in the periods mainly were the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the Euro.

It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% and our effective tax rate in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.\n2017 - A reduction of $15.8 million, or 188.6%, to the statutory rate resulted from revaluation of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the change in the federal enacted rate from 34% to 21%. An increase of $13.9 million, or 166.5%, to the statutory rate resulted from changes in the valuation allowance during the year, including a corresponding change in the valuation allowance due to revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities mentioned above. A reduction of $0.7 million, or 8.2%, resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions and a true-up of foreign income tax payables. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. No U.S. taxes were provided on foreign current year earnings/losses as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. No repatriation tax was provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries due to a net foreign earnings and profits deficit position. The net effect of all changes was an income tax benefit of $0.2 million recorded in 2017.\n2016 - A reduction of $4.0 million, or 29.3%, to the statutory rate resulted from changes in the valuation allowance during the year. A reduction of $0.4 million, or 3.1%, resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $23.0 million, an increase of $13.9 million compared to $9.1 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, our cash balance was $19.1 million.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,832\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (967\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (549\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (564\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch, debt obligations, purchase commitments and other obligations. Gross committed operating lease obligations are $4.4 million, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch is $4.3 million, the bank term loan, revolving loan facility and interest related obligation is $19.7 million, and purchase commitments and other obligations are $11.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total commitments due within one year are $29.7 million and due thereafter are $10.1 million at December 31, 2017. These commitment levels are based on existing terms of our operating leases, obligation with suppliers, our contractual payment obligation and the existing Loan and Security Agreements with EWB and VLL7 and VLL8 as of December 31, 2017.\nCash used in operating activities for 2017 primarily was due to the net loss of $8.2 million and decreases in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.8 million which was partially offset by adjustments for certain non-cash items of $7.1 million which primarily consisted of depreciation, amortization, amortization of debt issue costs, stock-based compensation and a loss on extinguishment of debt, net. For 2016, cash used in operating activities primarily was due to the net loss of $13.7 million and a decrease in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of less than $0.1 million, which were partially offset be adjustments for certain non-cash items of $7.6 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2017 reflects $1.0 million in capital expenditures. For 2016, cash used in investing activities reflects $0.5 million in capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities for 2017 related to borrowings of debt, net of issuance costs, of $53.0 million, proceeds from the sale of our common stock, net of issuance costs, of $12.6 million, and the issuance of Series B preferred stock of $12.0 million, offset by repayments of debt of $58.7 million and taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units of $0.8 million. Cash used in financing activities for 2016 was attributable to taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units of $0.2 million.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if any, as of December 31, 2017, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. Generally most of our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated deficits and cash and cash equivalents that are held outside the United States are typically not cash generated from earnings that would be subject to tax upon repatriation if transferred to the United States. We have access to the cash held outside the United States to fund domestic operations and obligations without any material income tax consequences. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash included at such subsidiaries was $1.4 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nOn February 8, 2017, we entered into Loan and Security Agreements with EWB and VLL7 and VLL8. The Loan and Security Agreement with EWB provides for a $10.0 million revolving loan facility, and the Loan Security Agreement with VLL7 and VLL8 provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. In connection with the closing of both Loan and Security Agreements, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our credit agreement with Opus Bank. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn December 28, 2017, we paid down an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million of the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance of the term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement with VLL7 and VLL8, and $0.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest outstanding at the prepayment date, together with all the scheduled interest that would have accrued and been payable through the stated maturity of the term loan. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn December 20, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with each of 21 April Fund, Ltd. and 21 April Fund, LP (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d), in which we, through a private placement, agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of up to 5,000,000 shares of Series B non-voting convertible preferred stock. The Purchasers purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 preferred shares at a price of $4.00 per share in cash at the initial closing of the transaction. We have the option to issue and sell an additional 2,000,000 preferred shares at a price of $4.00 per share in cash at a second closing within one year of initial closing. The total purchase price payable to us is $20,000,000, of which $12,000,000 was paid at the initial closing and $8,000,000 will be paid, if at all, at the second closing. We are required to use the proceeds from the issuance of the preferred shares to pay off existing debt obligations and to fund future acquisitions of technology, business and other assets. See Note 3, Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn January 31, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to our Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. Under the Third Amendment, the revolving loan facility under the Loan and Security Agreement was increased from $10.0 million to $12.0 million, the interest rate was reduced from prime rate plus 2.0% to prime rate plus 1.0%, a non-formula line of credit sublimit was added not to exceed $3.0 million, and certain financial covenants were amended, including the definition of EBITDA. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn February 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to our Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. Under the Fourth Amendment, EWB agreed to include as Permitted Indebtedness, as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement, the issuance of $2.0 million in subordinated unsecured promissory notes associated with the acquisition of 3VR, subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition, EWB agreed to include certain 3VR indebtedness payable to 3VR's lender, which remained outstanding subsequent to the acquisition, as Permitted Indebtedness, subject to us repaying in full amounts outstanding within 5 business days of the closing of the acquisition. On February 14, 2018, we completed the acquisition of 3VR, and on February 21, 2018, we paid 3VR's lender $3.6 million in full repayment of all indebtedness outstanding of 3VR. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to our Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. Under the Fifth Amendment, the revolving loan facility under the Loan and Security Agreement was increased from $12.0 million to $16.0 million. In addition, certain definitions were amended, including the definition of Borrowing Base. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we have a total accumulated deficit of $399.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a consolidated net loss of $8.1 million. Although we have, and expect to continue, to realize benefits of the restructuring initiatives realized in 2016, we may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe believe our existing cash balance, together with cash generated from operations and available credit under our Loan and Security Agreements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs to fund operations for the next twelve months. We may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. We may also finance our cash requirements through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that additional capital, if required, will be available to us or that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Loan and Security Agreements impose restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and have restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to curtail or reduce the scope of our business or forgo potential business opportunities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or issued guarantees to third parties.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes expected cash requirements for contractual obligations, excluding the bank term loan and revolving loan facility, as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More\nthan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual payment obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments and other obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contractual payment obligation was assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch. See Note 6, Contractual Payment Obligation, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nBank term loan and revolving loan facility contractual obligations include payments to be made for principal and interest in accordance with the terms at December 31, 2017 of the revolving loan facility and term loan under our Loan and Security Agreements. See Note 7, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe lease facilities, certain equipment, and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Purchases for inventories are highly dependent upon forecasts of customer demand. Due to the uncertainty in demand from our customers, we may have to change, reschedule, or cancel purchases or purchase orders from our suppliers. These changes may lead to vendor cancellation charges on these orders or contractual commitments. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur other long-term liabilities include gross unrecognized tax benefits, and related interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligation table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies contain our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenue Recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Inventory Valuation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income Taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Intangible and Long-lived Assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock-based Compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Delivery has occurred.

We assess collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by credit checks and customer payment histories. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements, and, in certain transactions, ASC 985 Software - Revenue Recognition.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some sales arrangement are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware, bundled with professional services, maintenance contracts, and in some cases with its software products, we evaluate each element, delivered and undelivered, in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. In these multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on a vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors, including pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives,\ninternal costs, competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles. Some of our offerings contain a significant element of proprietary technology and provide substantially unique features and functionality; as a result, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, typically we are not able to determine TPE for such products. Therefore ESP is used for such products in the selling price hierarchy for allocating the total arrangement consideration.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include software, we account for each element under the standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software is a delivered element, we use the residual method (ASC 605-25) for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for the delivered software component if VSOE for all of the undelivered elements has been established. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nRevenue from professional services contracts is recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance, if applicable. Professional services include security system integration, system migration and database conversion services. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contracts. Certain sales arrangement contains hardware, software and professional service elements where professional services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software system and a test of the functionality of the complete system is required before the customer accepts the system. As a result, hardware, software and professional service elements are accounted for as one unit of accounting and revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon completion of the project.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using FIFO, average cost or standard cost, as applicable) or market (net realizable value). We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory reserve based on judgment and assumptions involving an evaluation of technical obsolescence and our ability to sell based primarily on historical sales patterns and expectations for future demand. Actual demand and market conditions may differ from the projections utilized by management in establishing our inventory reserves. If we were to use different assumptions or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing of our inventory reserves could be materially different. Adverse changes in our inventory reserve valuations could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's assessment of estimated current and future income taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $108.5 million and $34.6 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017 - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 - 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2029 - 2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2035 - 2039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d) states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available.\nWe believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the associated interest and penalties, which are insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2017.\nWe consider the earnings of all our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide to repatriate foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.\nIntangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets and certain identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired (i.e., if the sum of its estimated future undiscounted cash flows used to test for recoverability is less than its carrying value), the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). Stock-based compensation expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option awards. The Black Scholes pricing model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense and operating results could be different.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a company called Identiv, Inc.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nEach of the terms the Company,\u201d Identiv,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nOverview\nIdentiv is a global security technology company that secures and manages access to physical places, things and information. Global organizations across government, education, retail, transportation, healthcare and other markets rely upon our solutions. We empower them to create secure and convenient experiences in schools, government offices, stores, banks, critical infrastructure, transportation, hospitals and virtually every type of facility and for a wide range of products.\nOur operating segments focus on the following solutions:\n \u2022 Physical security and customer insight solutions, securing buildings via an integrated access control system, included in our Premises (formerly referred to as PACS\u201d) segment. \n \u2022 Information security solutions, securing enterprise information access and secure transactions across PCs, networks, email, login, secure payments and printers via delivery of smart card reader products, included in our Identity segment. \n \u2022 Radio frequency identification ( RFID\u201d) based solutions for use in a wide range of applications from asset tracking to product authenticity, customer engagement, product instrumentation, transportation access and other applications sometimes included in the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d). The RFID devices are embedded into access cards, transponders and other embedded devices that enable frictionless access to and interaction with the physical world. \nThe foundation of our business is our deep technical expertise in RFID, smart card technology, and physical security technologies. Our close customer relationships and analytics platforms allow us to develop customer-relevant products and applications. This is all underpinned by our core value of uncompromising quality.\nTo deliver our solutions, we have organized our operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials, and All Other.\nPremises\nThe foundation of our physical security platform has been the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and a wide range of integrations that provide Velocity/MX's unique flexibility across a wide range of industries and implementations. We have further extended our physical access platform with our Identiv Connected Physical Access Manager ( ICPAM\u201d) software, derived from Cisco's Physical Access Manager ( CPAM\u201d) system and available in partnership with Cisco. Additionally, we sell either individual components or complete bundled solutions which can include any or all among software, edge controllers, multi-door panels, access readers, access cards and other components.\nOur modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nTo our price/performance/quality-leading commercial offerings, we have added what we believe to be the highest performance, lowest per-door cost access control system for the U.S. federal government security mandate known as the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management ( FICAM\u201d) architecture. This brings all of the advantages above into the next generation of physical security for the U.S. government departments and agencies to achieve Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS\u201d) 201 compliance.\nOur TouchSecure ( TS\u201d) door readers provide unique features to support a wide range of security standards. We support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication (\"NFC\") and government-issued credentials including Common Access Card ( CAC\u201d), Personal Verification Identification ( PIV\u201d), Personal Verification Identification - Interoperable ( PIV-I\u201d) and others. Additionally, our Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered, and providing both secure two-factor authentication and convenient alternative-factor access.\nIn addition to this solution offering, in 2017, we launched Identiv Global Services ( IGS\u201d), a service offering with a comprehensive catalog of end-to-end services that facilitates customer success and drives deeper adoption of the Identiv product portfolio. IGS supports customers throughout their premises security lifecycle from system design, to deployment to managed services. IGS experts enable customers to address today's complex security and IT systems interoperability requirements, and helps them achieve a tailor-made set-up.\nIn February 2018, we acquired 3VR Security, Inc. ( 3VR\u201d), a video technology and analytics company. Our new offerings include video intelligence solutions which provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems' capabilities seamlessly.\nIn addition to our core products, we have a range of product initiatives to leverage leading technology advances across mobile, biometric, machine-learning and other areas, to provide convenient, frictionless, low-cost yet highly secure physical access. We invest independently and in partnership with other leading technology companies in these emerging aspects of physical security and analytics platforms.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical access (i.e., PC, network or data access) and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nWith over 20 years of smart card reader, application and token experience, we are known for our expertise in this complex ecosystem. We combine our deep technical expertise with an optimized supply chain, to provide the most optimal, cost-effective and high-quality smart card-based products. Whether Identiv branded products, original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) branded, or embedded chips or modules, our position is as the trusted business solution provider for all users and issuers of smart cards and embedded-chip applications.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials segment includes NFC and RFID products, including inlays and inlay\u00adbased and other cards, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and integrated circuits ( IC\u201d) components and our generally grouped into access cards and transponders. Our TS Cards product line, we believe, is the first complete solution to allow customers to pay only for the most basic low-frequency proximity access technology while having the ability to evolve to the higher-security high-frequency and highest-security public key infrastructure ( PKI\u201d) based access credentials. This product line exemplifies our values: we place no burden on our customers, instead providing the most cost-effective solution to their basic needs; and then delivering within this platform the ability for them to move to higher-level needs and capabilities, when they want, when they are ready and when they will realize economic and experience benefits.\nOur transponder products span the full range of high frequency ( HF\u201d) and ultra-high frequency ( UHF\u201d) technologies. Our differentiation is analogous to application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICS\u201d) in the semiconductor market. We leverage our flexible platform, our deep technical expertise and our infrastructure and supply chain to deliver solutions optimized for our customers' business goals. We believe we are more responsive, more flexible, more experienced in business-optimized solutions and have a better track record of sustained delivery of solution-specific, high-quality RFID devices than our competitors. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment such as virtual reality ( VR\u201d), games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management, cold-chain management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we are developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the IoT, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment included legacy product lines, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. No revenues from this segment were generated in 2017 and no revenues are expected to be generated in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we phased out our Digital Media product lines and discontinued our Chipdrive product line.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or OEMs. We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 9, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\n\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2017 was $60.2 million, an increase of 7% compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Approximately 40% of our net revenue came from our Premises segment. Net revenue in our Premises segment was $24.2 million in 2017 compared to $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Identity segment, which represented approximately 24% of total net revenue, was $14.3 million in 2017 compared with $12.9 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Credentials segment represented approximately 36% of our net revenue. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2017 was $21.8 million compared with $18.0 million in 2016.\nNet revenue in the Americas\nNet revenue in the Americas was $40.0 million in 2017, accounting for 67% of total net revenue, up 5% compared with $38.1 million in 2016. Net revenue from our Premises solution for security programs within various U.S. government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags represented approximately 54% of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment in the Americas in 2017 was comparable to 2016 primarily due to higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, offset by lower sales of physical access control readers. Net revenue from our Identity segment decreased 24% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to lower smart card reader sales. Net revenue in our Credentials segment increased 33% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher RFID and NFC transponder and access card sales.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive ( HSPD\u201d) 12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our solution for trusted physical access is an attractive offering to help federal agency customers move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders sourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and our sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was approximately $20.2 million in 2017, accounting for 33% of total net revenue, an increase of approximately 12% compared with 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales in the Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower sales in the Europe and the Middle East regions. Net revenue in these regions are dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Premises products decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to lower sales of physical access control solutions in the Europe and Middle East regions, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Net revenue from our Identity products increased approximately 39% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher sales of smart card readers in both regions. Identity reader sales in 2017 and 2016 comprised approximately 49% and 40% of the net revenue throughout these regions, respectively. Net revenue from our Credentials products in 2017, which comprised approximately 38% of sales in these regions, increased 4% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of higher RFID and NFC transponder product sales in both regions.\nSeasonality and Other Factors\nIn our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e., research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) decreased 16% in 2017 compared with 2016. Research and development spending decreased by 6% in 2017 compared with 2017 resulting from restructuring initiatives undertaken in the first quarter of 2016 and additional headcount reductions in 2017, partially offset by higher product certification costs. Selling and marketing spending in 2017 decreased by 4% compared with 2016, due to cost saving initiatives taken in the sales and marketing organization reducing marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2017 decreased by 36% compared with 2016 primarily due to lower legal and professional fees, reimbursements received from an insurance provider for legal fees incurred related to legal proceedings, and credits received from service providers for legal fees invoiced in prior periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue and segment net profit information by business segment and reconciles gross profit to results of operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest.\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue in 2017 was $60.2 million, up 7% compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Net revenue was higher in 2017 primarily driven by higher sales in our Identity and Credentials segments. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2017 was comparable with 2016. A more detailed discussion of net revenue by segment follows below.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment of $24.2 million in 2017 was comparable with $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue from higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, were offset by lower sales of physical access control readers.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment of $14.3 million in 2017 increased 11% from $12.9 million in 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales of smart card readers in the Europe and the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, partially offset by lower smart card reader sales in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $21.8 million in 2017, an increase of 21% from $18.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher RFID and NFC transponder sales and in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions. In addition, sales of access card products increased 27% in the Americas, slightly offset by lower access card product sales in Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2017 was $22.2 million, or 37% of net revenue, compared to $23.7 million or 42% of net revenue in 2016. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $13.7 million in 2017 and $14.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were 57% in 2017 and in 2016.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as credential provisioning and management services was $5.1 million in 2017 compared to $5.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins were lower in 2017 at 36% compared with 39% in 2016 primarily due to Identity product sales to international customers with lower margins.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of physical access credentials and authenticity and tracking applications was $3.4 million in 2017 compared with $4.4 million in 2016. Gross profit in the Credentials segment was lower primarily due to a transponder related inventory reserve adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with a customer relationship which ended at the end of 2015 and our decision to discontinue plans for alternate use of the product. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment were lower in 2017 at 15% compared with 25% in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of lower margin sales and the transponder related inventory reserve adjustment described above.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities.\nResearch and development expenses in 2017 decreased primarily as a result of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in the first quarter of 2016 and additional headcount reductions in 2017, partially offset by higher product certification costs.\nSelling and Marketing\n\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation as well as amortization expense of certain intangible assets, tradeshow participation, advertising and other marketing and selling costs.\nSelling and marketing expenses in 2017 decreased compared with 2016 primarily due to a reduction in headcount and marketing program spending.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees performing administrative functions, and professional fees incurred for legal, auditing and other consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower professional and legal fees, including reimbursements of $1.0 million in 2017 from our insurance provider for legal fees incurred in connection with matters related to a complaint by a former employee, related investigations, the class and derivative litigation and related proceedings, and credits received from service providers for legal fees invoiced in prior periods.\nRestructuring and Severance Charges\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus our resources on our core business segments, including", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.

The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nTo our price/performance/quality-leading commercial offerings, we have added what we believe to be the highest performance, lowest per-door cost access control system for the U.S. federal government security mandate known as the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management ( FICAM\u201d) architecture. This brings all of the advantages above into the next generation of physical security for the U.S. government departments and agencies to achieve Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS\u201d) 201 compliance.\nOur TouchSecure ( TS\u201d) door readers provide unique features to support a wide range of security standards. We support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication (\"NFC\") and government-issued credentials including Common Access Card ( CAC\u201d), Personal Verification Identification ( PIV\u201d), Personal Verification Identification - Interoperable ( PIV-I\u201d) and others. Additionally, our Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered, and providing both secure two-factor authentication and convenient alternative-factor access.\nIn addition to this solution offering, in 2017, we launched Identiv Global Services ( IGS\u201d), a service offering with a comprehensive catalog of end-to-end services that facilitates customer success and drives deeper adoption of the Identiv product portfolio. IGS supports customers throughout their premises security lifecycle from system design, to deployment to managed services. IGS experts enable customers to address today's complex security and IT systems interoperability requirements, and helps them achieve a tailor-made set-up.\nIn February 2018, we acquired 3VR Security, Inc. ( 3VR\u201d), a video technology and analytics company. Our new offerings include video intelligence solutions which provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems' capabilities seamlessly.\nIn addition to our core products, we have a range of product initiatives to leverage leading technology advances across mobile, biometric, machine-learning and other areas, to provide convenient, frictionless, low-cost yet highly secure physical access. We invest independently and in partnership with other leading technology companies in these emerging aspects of physical security and analytics platforms.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical access (i.e., PC, network or data access) and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nWith over 20 years of smart card reader, application and token experience, we are known for our expertise in this complex ecosystem. We combine our deep technical expertise with an optimized supply chain, to provide the most optimal, cost-effective and high-quality smart card-based products. Whether Identiv branded products, original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) branded, or embedded chips or modules, our position is as the trusted business solution provider for all users and issuers of smart cards and embedded-chip applications.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials segment includes NFC and RFID products, including inlays and inlay\u00adbased and other cards, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and integrated circuits ( IC\u201d) components and our generally grouped into access cards and transponders. Our TS Cards product line, we believe, is the first complete solution to allow customers to pay only for the most basic low-frequency proximity access technology while having the ability to evolve to the higher-security high-frequency and highest-security public key infrastructure ( PKI\u201d) based access credentials. This product line exemplifies our values: we place no burden on our customers, instead providing the most cost-effective solution to their basic needs; and then delivering within this platform the ability for them to move to higher-level needs and capabilities, when they want, when they are ready and when they will realize economic and experience benefits.\nOur transponder products span the full range of high frequency ( HF\u201d) and ultra-high frequency ( UHF\u201d) technologies. Our differentiation is analogous to application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICS\u201d) in the semiconductor market. We leverage our flexible platform, our deep technical expertise and our infrastructure and supply chain to deliver solutions optimized for our customers' business goals. We believe we are more responsive, more flexible, more experienced in business-optimized solutions and have a better track record of sustained delivery of solution-specific, high-quality RFID devices than our competitors. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment such as virtual reality ( VR\u201d), games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management, cold-chain management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we are developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the IoT, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment included legacy product lines, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. No revenues from this segment were generated in 2017 and no revenues are expected to be generated in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we phased out our Digital Media product lines and discontinued our Chipdrive product line.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or OEMs. We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 9, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2017 was $60.2 million, an increase of 7% compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Approximately 40% of our net revenue came from our Premises segment. Net revenue in our Premises segment was $24.2 million in 2017 compared to $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Identity segment, which represented approximately 24% of total net revenue, was $14.3 million in 2017 compared with $12.9 million in 2016. Net revenue in our Credentials segment represented approximately 36% of our net revenue. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2017 was $21.8 million compared with $18.0 million in 2016.\nNet revenue in the Americas\nNet revenue in the Americas was $40.0 million in 2017, accounting for 67% of total net revenue, up 5% compared with $38.1 million in 2016. Net revenue from our Premises solution for security programs within various U.S. government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags represented approximately 54% of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment in the Americas in 2017 was comparable to 2016 primarily due to higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, offset by lower sales of physical access control readers. Net revenue from our Identity segment decreased 24% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to lower smart card reader sales. Net revenue in our Credentials segment increased 33% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher RFID and NFC transponder and access card sales.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive ( HSPD\u201d) 12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our solution for trusted physical access is an attractive offering to help federal agency customers move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders sourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and our sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was approximately $20.2 million in 2017, accounting for 33% of total net revenue, an increase of approximately 12% compared with 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales in the Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower sales in the Europe and the Middle East regions. Net revenue in these regions are dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Premises products decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to lower sales of physical access control solutions in the Europe and Middle East regions, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Net revenue from our Identity products increased approximately 39% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher sales of smart card readers in both regions. Identity reader sales in 2017 and 2016 comprised approximately 49% and 40% of the net revenue throughout these regions, respectively. Net revenue from our Credentials products in 2017, which comprised approximately 38% of sales in these regions, increased 4% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of higher RFID and NFC transponder product sales in both regions.\nSeasonality and Other Factors\nIn our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e., research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) decreased 16% in 2017 compared with 2016. Research and development spending decreased by 6% in 2017 compared with 2017 resulting from restructuring initiatives undertaken in the first quarter of 2016 and additional headcount reductions in 2017, partially offset by higher product certification costs. Selling and marketing spending in 2017 decreased by 4% compared with 2016, due to cost saving initiatives taken in the sales and marketing organization reducing marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2017 decreased by 36% compared with 2016 primarily due to lower legal and professional fees, reimbursements received from an insurance provider for legal fees incurred related to legal proceedings, and credits received from service providers for legal fees invoiced in prior periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue

compared with $56.2 million in 2016. Net revenue was higher in 2017 primarily driven by higher sales in our Identity and Credentials segments. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2017 was comparable with 2016. A more detailed discussion of net revenue by segment follows below.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment of $24.2 million in 2017 was comparable with $24.7 million in 2016. Net revenue from higher software product sales, higher sales through our channel partners, and an increase in professional services engagements, were offset by lower sales of physical access control readers.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment of $14.3 million in 2017 increased 11% from $12.9 million in 2016 primarily as a result of higher sales of smart card readers in the Europe and the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, partially offset by lower smart card reader sales in the Americas region.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $21.8 million in 2017, an increase of 21% from $18.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher RFID and NFC transponder sales and in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions. In addition, sales of access card products increased 27% in the Americas, slightly offset by lower access card product sales in Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2017 was $22.2 million, or 37% of net revenue, compared to $23.7 million or 42% of net revenue in 2016. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $13.7 million in 2017 and $14.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were 57% in 2017 and in 2016.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as credential provisioning and management services was $5.1 million in 2017 compared to $5.0 million in 2016. Gross profit margins were lower in 2017 at 36% compared with 39% in 2016 primarily due to Identity product sales to international customers with lower margins.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of physical access credentials and authenticity and tracking applications was $3.4 million in 2017 compared with $4.4 million in 2016. Gross profit in the Credentials segment was lower primarily due to a transponder related inventory reserve adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with a customer relationship which ended at the end of 2015 and our decision to discontinue plans for alternate use of the product. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment were lower in 2017 at 15% compared with 25% in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of lower margin sales and the transponder related inventory reserve adjustment described above.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products.
