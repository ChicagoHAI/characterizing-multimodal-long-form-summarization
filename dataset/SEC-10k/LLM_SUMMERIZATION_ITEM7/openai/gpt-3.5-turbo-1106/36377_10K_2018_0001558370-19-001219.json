MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains, and from time to time our management may make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may,\u201d might,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d continue,\u201d will,\u201d anticipate,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d projection,\u201d would,\u201d annualized\u201d and outlook,\u201d or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nA number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including the following: the geographic concentration of our business; current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan in particular; concentrated exposures to certain asset classes and individual obligors; the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our business including our net interest income, net interest margin, the fair value of our investment securities, and our mortgage loan originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined; the possibility we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio; our inability to receive dividends from our bank, pay dividends to our common stockholders and satisfy obligations as they become due; the effects of geopolitical instability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and man-made and natural disasters; our ability to maintain our bank's reputation; our ability to attract and retain skilled employees or changes in our management personnel; our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies and the effects of competition in the financial services industry on our business; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; changes in the demand for our products and services; the effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; any failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks; the effect of a material breach of, or disruption to, the security of any of our or our vendors' systems; the failure to properly use and protect our customer and employee information and data; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; our ability to attract and retain customer deposits; the effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions; our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; our use of the secondary mortgage market as a source of liquidity; risks associated with the sale of loans and with our use of appraisals in valuing and monitoring loans; the possibility that actual results may differ from estimates and forecasts; the potential for environmental liability; fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures; the effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party; the impact of, and changes in, applicable laws, regulations and accounting standards and policies, including the enactment of the Tax Act (Public Law 115-97) on December 22, 2017; possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations; our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, litigation or regulatory actions; market perceptions associated with our separation from BNPP and other aspects of our business; our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock; contingent liabilities and unexpected tax liabilities that may be applicable to us as a result of the Reorganization Transactions; our ability to retain service providers to perform oversight or control functions or services that have otherwise been performed in the past by affiliates of BNPP; the one-time and incremental costs of operating as a stand-alone public company; our ability to meet our obligations as a public company, including our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and damage to our reputation from any of the factors described above.\nThe foregoing factors should not be considered an exhaustive list and should be read together with the other cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual\nresults may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nCompany Overview\nFHI, a bank holding company, owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of FHB. FHB was founded in 1858 under the name Bishop & Company and was the first successful banking partnership in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the second oldest bank formed west of the Mississippi River.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were the largest full service bank headquartered in Hawaii as measured by assets, loans and leases, deposits and net income. As of December 31, 2018, we had $20.7 billion of assets, $13.1 billion of gross loans and leases and $17.2 billion of deposits. We also generated $264.4 million of net income or diluted earnings per share of $1.93 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. We operate our business through three operating segments: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Treasury and Other. See Note 23. Reportable Operating Segments\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.\nReorganization Transactions\nOn April 1, 2016, BNPP effected the Reorganization Transactions pursuant to which FHI, which was then known as BancWest, contributed BOW, its subsidiary at the time, to BWHI, a newly formed bank holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. Upon formation, BWHI was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BancWest and, as part of the Reorganization Transactions, BancWest contributed 100% of its interest in BOW to BWHI. Following the contribution of BOW to BWHI, BancWest distributed its interest in BWHI to BNPP, and BWHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. As part of these transactions, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name to First Hawaiian, Inc., with the Bank remaining our only direct wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe Reorganization Transactions were made in connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP. On July 1, 2016, in order to comply with the Federal Reserve's requirement (under Regulation YY) applicable to BNPP that a foreign banking organization with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets as of June 30, 2015 establish a U.S. intermediate holding company and hold its interest in the substantial majority of its U.S. subsidiaries through the intermediate holding company by July 1, 2016, we became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA, BNPP's U.S. intermediate holding company. As part of that reorganization, we became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BWC, the BNPP selling stockholder and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA.\nPublic Offerings and Separation from BNPP\nShares of FHI's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol FHB\u201d on August 4, 2016. In August 2016, FHI completed its IPO of 24,250,000 shares of common stock sold by BWC. In February 2017, BWC sold an additional 28,750,000 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering. In May and June 2018, BWC sold an additional 16,830,000 shares of FHI common stock in the aggregate in a secondary offering. BWC sold 20,000,000 additional shares of FHI common stock in secondary offerings completed in each of August and September 2018, respectively. BWC sold shares of FHI common stock of 2,968,069 and 1,801,801 in May and August 2018, respectively, to the Company pursuant to share repurchase agreements. BWC sold 24,859,750 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering completed in February 2019. FHI did not receive any of the proceeds from the aforementioned sales of shares of its common stock by BWC. Following the completion of the secondary offering completed on February 1, 2019, BNPP (through BWC) fully exited its ownership interest in FHI common stock.\nUpon the completion of the August 2018 and September 2018 offerings, BNPP-directors Jean-Milan Givadinovitch, Xavier Antiglio and J. Michael Shepherd resigned from the board of directors. The FHI board of directors appointed Faye Kurren, Jenai Wall and C. Scott Wo to fill such vacancies. Following the completion of the February 2019 offering, Michel Vial and G\u00e9rard Gil, the remaining BNPP designees to the FHI board of directors, resigned from the board of directors. As a result, all directors designated by BNPP have resigned from the FHI board of directors.\nThe Company and/or Bank entered into contractual arrangements with BNPP and/or its affiliates to provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with BNPP, including a Stockholder Agreement, a Transitional Services Agreement, a Registration Rights Agreement, a License Agreement and an Insurance Agreement. Among other things, the Stockholder Agreement set forth certain agreements that governed the relationship between the Company and BNPP following the IPO until the Non-Control Date\u201d, which is defined in the Stockholder Agreement as the date on which BNPP ceases to control the Company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as provided for in a written determination from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or such earlier date as BNPP may designate in writing to the Company. On February 12, 2019, following the completion of BNPP's divestiture of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2019 and the resignation from the Company's board of directors of all remaining directors nominated by BNPP, under the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, the non-control date under the Stockholder Agreement occurred. As a result, BNPP's governance and consent rights under the Stockholder Agreement, and its substantive rights under the Registration Rights Agreement, have terminated.\nPursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement, BNPP, BWHI and BOW provided us with certain services they provided prior to the IPO either directly or on a pass-through basis, and we provided, or arranged to provide, BNPP, BWHI and BOW with certain services we provided to them prior to the IPO, either directly or on a pass-through basis. The Transitional Services Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018, although the provision of certain services terminated prior to the agreement termination date and certain other services continue to be provided beyond the agreement termination date as agreed by the parties. In connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental ongoing and one-time expenses, as well as increases in audit fees, insurance premiums, employee salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation expenses for employees and non-employee directors), and fees and expenses that may have been previously reimbursed by BNPP or its affiliates and consulting fees. These costs also include increases that we expect to result from the higher pricing of services by third-party vendors whose future contracts with us do not reflect BOW volumes or the benefits of BNPP bargaining power. Our one-time expenses incurred in connection with our IPO included professional fees, consulting fees and certain filing and listing fees. The actual amount of the incremental expenses we incur as a stand-alone public company may be higher, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons and there may be additional related costs we may incur that we have not currently anticipated.\nBasis of Presentation\nFor periods prior to April 1, 2016, the financial operations, assets and liabilities of BancWest (now known as First Hawaiian, Inc.) related to FHB (and not BOW) have been combined with FHB and are presented on a basis of accounting that reflects a change in reporting entity as if we were a separate stand-alone entity for all periods presented. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain assets of BancWest as agreed to by the parties and also certain expenses amounting to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, specifically applicable to the operations of BancWest related to FHB through the date of the Reorganization Transactions. Management believes these allocations are reasonable. Prior to April 1, 2016, the residual revenues and expenses not included in our consolidated financial statements represent those directly related to BWHI and BOW. The allocated expenses included in our consolidated financial statements, residual revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations of our company if we had operated as a stand-alone public entity during the reporting periods prior to April 1, 2016 and may not be indicative of our company's future results of operations and financial condition.\nUpon completion of the Reorganization Transactions on April 1, 2016, the consolidated financial statements of the Company reflected the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of FHI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, FHB. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any changes that may occur in our operations and expenses as a result of the Reorganization Transactions or our IPO.\nHawaii Economy\nHawaii's economy continued to perform well during the year ended December 31, 2018, led in large part by a strong tourism industry and growth in personal income and tax revenues, offsetting a slight decline in real estate and labor market conditions. Hawaii's tourism industry remained robust, achieving new records in 2018 in visitor arrivals and spending. Visitor arrivals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 5.9% compared to 2017, and total visitor spending for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 6.8% compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Tourism\nAuthority. Visitor arrivals and spending increased, in particular, from U.S. mainland and Canadian visitors. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 2.0% in December 2017 according to the Hawaii State Department of Labor & Industrial Relations. The national seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9% in December 2018 compared to 4.1% in December 2017. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased by 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased by 2.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Honolulu Board of Realtors. However, the median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu was $790,000 and $420,000, respectively, or an increase of 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively. Lastly, state general excise and use tax revenues increased by 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Department of Taxation.\nHawaii's economy continued to grow during 2018, but is significantly dependent on U.S. mainland economic conditions as well as key international economies, particularly Japan. We continue to monitor construction activity in Hawaii and the local economy's ability to absorb further planned expansion given deteriorating home affordability, tourism in Hawaii, the movement of interest rates in the U.S., the agenda of the U.S. administration and its impact on existing banking regulations, changes in Japan's economic conditions including the exchange rate of its currency, and the economic and regulatory conditions of the European Union, as such factors could impact our profitability in future reporting periods.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet income was $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $80.7 million or 44% as compared to the same period in 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.61 or 46% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for income taxes and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $24.1 million OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Core net income was $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $56.3 million or 24% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $2.09 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.44 or 27% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nNet income was $183.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $46.5 million or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.32 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.33 or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for income taxes, a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $47.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes as a result of the Tax Act. Core net income was $230.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.3 million or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.09 or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 1.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 39 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 10.76% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 352 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. Our return on average tangible assets was 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 18.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 617 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. We continued to manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 48.96% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47.32% for the same period in 2017. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 27 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 7.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 172 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. Our return on average tangible assets was 0.97% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 29 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 11.91% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 273 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. We continued to prudently manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 47.32% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 46.99% for the same period in 2016. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was favorably impacted by net gains on the sale of investment securities of $27.3 million. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6.

to the same period in 2017. Our net interest margin was 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 17 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher average balances and yields in most loan categories and higher yields in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio and higher deposit funding costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average balance of our loans and leases was $12.6 billion, an increase of $625.6 million or 5% compared to the same period in 2017. The higher average balance in loans and leases was primarily due to growth in our residential mortgage, commercial real estate, consumer and construction lending portfolios, partially offset by declines in our commercial and industrial portfolio. Yields on our loans and leases were 4.22% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 35 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. We experienced an increase in our yields from total loans primarily due to increases in adjustable rate commercial loans, which are typically based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased $358.5 million or 7% to $4.8 billion. Yields on our investment securities portfolio were 2.21% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 24 basis points from the same period in 2017. Deposit funding costs were $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $31.0 million compared to the same period in 2017. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 65 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 27 basis points compared to the same period in 2017. While we experienced higher rates paid on all interest-bearing deposit categories in the year ended December 31, 2018, particularly high rates were paid on our time deposits with an increase of 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million or 8% as compared to the same period in 2016. Our net interest margin was 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher average balances in most loan categories and higher average balances and yields in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset\nby higher average balances in interest-bearing deposits and higher deposit funding costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average balance of our loans and leases was $11.9 billion, an increase of $769.4 million or 7% compared to the same period in 2016. The higher average balance in loans and leases was primarily due to strong growth in our commercial real estate, construction, residential mortgage and consumer lending portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2017, yields on our investment securities portfolio were 1.97%, an increase of 15 basis points from the same period in 2016. The average balance of our investment securities portfolio increased $652.5 million or 14% to $5.2 billion. Yields on our loans and leases were 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of four basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. Deposit funding costs were $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $15.4 million or 58% compared to the same period in 2016. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 38 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 13 basis points from the same period in 2016.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Provision was $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of $3.7 million compared to the same period in 2017. We recorded net charge-offs of $17.7 million and $16.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This represented net charge-offs of 0.14% of total average loans and leases as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Allowance was $141.7 million and $137.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and represented 1.08% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.12% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2017. The Provision is recorded to maintain the Allowance at levels deemed adequate by management based on the factors noted in the Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Credit Risk\u201d section of this MD&A.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 3 presents the major components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nService charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,771)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,585)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredit and debit card fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,213)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,292)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrust and investment services income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,066)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,738)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment securities gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27,277)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn.m.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24,085)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24,085)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn.m.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n178,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n205,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n226,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(26,612)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(20,432)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nn.m. - Denotes a variance that is not a meaningful metric to inform the change in noninterest income from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2018 and from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in 2017.\nTotal noninterest income was $179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $26.6 million or 13% as compared to the same period in 2017. Total noninterest income was $205.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $20.4 million or 9% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nService charges on deposit accounts were $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.8 million or 11% as compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $3.7 million decrease in account analysis service charges due to higher earning credit rates that offset fee income. Service charges on deposit accounts were $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.6 million or 4% as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.8 million decrease in account analysis service charges due to both higher balances in business accounts and higher credit rates, which resulted in higher earning credits that offset fee income, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in overdraft and checking account fees from lower average transactional account balances during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCredit and debit card fees were $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.7 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in merchant service revenues and a $1.5 million increase in interchange settlement fees, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in network association dues. Credit and debit card fees were $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.2 million or 2% as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in interchange settlement fees, a $1.0 million increase in network association dues and a $0.3 million decrease in rental fees from credit card terminals, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in merchant service revenues.\nOther service charges and fees were $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.3 million or 12% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in fees from the sale of annuities and securities, a $0.8 million increase in fee income from our cash management services, a $0.6 million increase in fees from standby letters of credit arrangements and a $0.5 million increase in residential mortgage loan servicing fees. Other service charges and fees were $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.3 million or 4% as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in residential mortgage loan servicing fees.\nTrust and investment services income was $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.8 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in investment management fees and a $0.3 million increase in business cash management fees. Trust and investment services income was $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.0 million or 4% as compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in irrevocable trust fees, a $0.3 million increase in business cash management fees, a $0.2 million increase in investment management fees and a $0.2 million increase in corporate trust and agency fees.\nBOLI income was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.1 million or 31% as compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in BOLI earnings and a $0.6 million decrease in death benefits received. BOLI income was $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.7 million or 12% as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.5 million decrease in death benefits received, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in BOLI earnings.\nNet gains on the sale of investment securities were nil for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This was a decrease of $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Net gains on the sale of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily due to a $22.7 million net gain on the sale of 274,000 Visa Class B restricted shares.\nOTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $24.1 million as compared to the same period in 2017. OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were due to our intent to sell 48 securities with a book value of $898.2 million. As a result we recorded an OTTI write-down of $24.1 million, representing the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the securities, during December 2018. OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities were nil for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther noninterest income was $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.4 million or 5% as compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $7.0 million decrease related to gains on the sale of bank properties in 2017, a $2.2 million decrease in income due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions, a $0.8 million decrease related to insurance proceeds from severe weather which affected the Hawaiian Islands and a $0.6 million decrease in merchant discount fees related to debit card transactions. This was partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in net gains recognized in income related to derivative contracts, a $1.2 million increase in gains on the sale of leased equipment and a $1.2 million general excise tax refund. Other noninterest income was $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $11.6 million or 71% as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $6.9 million gain on the sale of real estate, a $3.9 million increase in income due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the signing of the Tax Act, a $1.2 million increase in vendor bonuses received, a $1.1 million decrease in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights and a $1.0 million increase related to insurance proceeds from severe weather which affected the Hawaiian Islands. This was partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in recoveries on loans in excess of amounts previously charged-off for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 4 presents the major components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and employee benefits(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n167,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n163,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n157,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContracted services and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(334)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRegulatory assessment and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(690)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdvertising and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,378)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCard rewards program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(451)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n364,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n347,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n337,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively.

Total noninterest expense was $347.6 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense was $167.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.1 million or 2% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $7.7 million increase in base salaries and related payroll taxes and a $2.4 million increase in group health plan costs. This was partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in deferred loan origination costs, a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation and a $1.4 million decrease in other compensation, primarily related to bonuses to employees due to the benefits from the Tax Act being passed in December 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.9 million or 4% as compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to an $8.3 million increase in base salaries and related payroll taxes, a $2.2 million increase in other compensation, primarily related to the aforementioned bonuses to employees and a $0.8 million increase in group health plan costs. This was partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in deferred loan origination costs and a $2.7 million decrease in incentive compensation.\nContracted services and professional fees were $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.8 million or 11% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in outside services, primarily attributable to marketing services and new customer services and a $1.9 million increase in contracted data processing, primarily related to new merchant billing services. Contracted services and professional fees were $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.3 million or 1% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nOccupancy expense was $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.8 million or 16% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in net sublease rental income, a $1.5 million increase in building maintenance expense and a $0.6 million increase in utilities expense. This was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in ATM rent expense. Occupancy expense was $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.9 million or 9% as compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in net sublease rental income and a $0.3 million increase in building maintenance expense.\nEquipment expense was $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.5 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2017. Equipment expense was $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.3 million or 2% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nRegulatory assessment and fees were $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million or 5% as compared to the same period in 2017. Regulatory assessment and fees were $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.9 million or 15% as compared to the same period in 2016. Starting in the third quarter of 2016, there was a change in the calculation of the FDIC insurance assessment and the adoption of an addition surcharge, which resulted in a higher insurance rate. This additional surcharge required by the FDIC ended during the third quarter of 2018. The decrease of the regulatory assessment and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 was based on the exclusion of the additional surcharge for the last three months of 2018. The increase of the regulatory assessment and fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to six additional months under the new calculation and surcharge during 2017 as well as a higher assessment base (i.e., average total assets) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAdvertising and marketing expense was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.4 million or 22% as compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in vendor reimbursements, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in advertising costs. Advertising and marketing expense was $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.1 million or 1% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nCard rewards program expense was $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.5 million or 6% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in credit card cash reward redemptions. Card rewards program expense was $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.9 million or 4% as compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a change in terms related to the expiration of our debit card reward points recorded during 2017.\nOther noninterest expense was $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.8 million or 9% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $4.1 million charge recorded in 2018 in connection with an agreement in principle to settle a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, a $1.0 million increase in operational losses (which includes losses as a result of bank error, fraud, items processing, or theft), a $0.9 million increase in charitable contributions and a $0.7 million loss on our funding swap related to a decrease in the conversion rate of our Visa Class B restricted shares sold in 2016. This was partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in pension-related expenses. Other noninterest expense was $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million or 1% as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in operational losses (which includes losses as a result of bank error, fraud, items processing, or theft), a $0.7 million decrease in expenses related to clean-up and repairs from severe weather which affected the Hawaiian Islands in 2016, a $0.4 million decrease in telephone expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in travel expenses. This was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in software amortization expense and a $0.8 million increase in insurance expense as a result of higher rates due to our transition to a stand-alone public company.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $93.8 million (reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.18%) for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a provision for income taxes of $184.7 million (reflecting an effective tax rate of 50.13%) for the same period in 2017. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction in the corporate tax rate required a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets, which resulted in the Company recording $47.6 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional information about the provision for income taxes is presented in Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Deposit products offered include checking, savings and time deposit accounts. Our Retail Banking segment also includes our wealth management services. Products and services from Retail Banking are delivered to customers through 60 banking locations throughout the State of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan.\nNet income for the Retail Banking segment was $225.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $73.5 million or 48% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a $60.9 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and a $16.6 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in noninterest expense and a $1.9 million increase in the Provision. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the reduction of the corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits as a result of higher average balances and margins in our deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a charge related to a settlement agreement to resolve a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense and contracted services and professional fees, partially offset by lower expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment. The increase in total assets for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to strong residential real estate loan growth, reflective of the strong housing market and economic conditions in Hawaii during 2018.\nNet income for the Retail Banking segment was $151.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $30.6 million or 17% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a $28.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes, an $11.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a $3.7 million increase in the Provision, partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in net interest income. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets under the Tax Act in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher allocated expenses, salaries and employee benefits expense, contracted services and professional fees, occupancy expense and regulatory assessment and fees. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits as a result of higher average balances and margins in our deposit portfolio. The increase in total assets for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to strong residential real estate loan growth, reflective of the strong housing market and economic conditions in Hawaii during 2017.\nCommercial Banking. Our Commercial Banking segment includes our corporate banking, residential and commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, automobile loans and auto dealer financing, business deposit products and credit cards that we provide primarily to middle market and large companies in Hawaii, Guam, Saipan and California.\nNet income for the Commercial Banking segment was $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.6 million or 31% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a $24.0 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, a $5.5 million increase in noninterest income and a $2.4 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $12.6 million increase in noninterest expense and a $1.8 million increase in the Provision. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the reduction of the corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The increase in noninterest income was\nprimarily due to an increase in merchant service revenues and interchange settlement fees, a gain on the sale of leased equipment and an increase in fee income from our cash management services, partially offset by an increase in network association dues. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher interest income from our commercial lending portfolio, particularly our commercial real estate loans. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment and an increase in card reward expenses, contracted services and professional fees and operational losses. The increase in total assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to growth in our commercial real estate portfolio, reflective of a strong real estate market in Hawaii during 2018.\nNet income for the Commercial Banking segment was $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $18.6 million or 25% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a $6.2 million increase in the Provision, a $5.0 million increase in noninterest expense, a $4.3 million decrease in net interest income and a $4.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher allocated expenses, regulatory assessment and fees and card reward expenses, partially offset by lower operational losses. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher allocated charges from credit cards and lower amortized loan origination fees. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets under the Tax Act in 2017. The increase in total assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to growth in our commercial real estate portfolio, reflective of a strong real estate market in Hawaii during 2017.\nTreasury and Other. Our Treasury and Other segment includes our treasury business, which consists of corporate asset and liability management activities, including interest rate risk management. The assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) of our treasury business consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, short and long-term borrowings and bank-owned properties. Our primary sources of noninterest income are from BOLI, net gains from the sale of investment securities, foreign exchange income related to customer driven currency requests from merchants and island visitors and management of bank-owned properties in Hawaii and Guam. The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury and Other, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions.\nOther organizational units (Technology, Operations, Credit and Risk Management, Human Resources, Finance, Administration, Marketing, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide range of support to our other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the applicable business segments through an internal cost allocation process.\nNet loss for the Treasury and Other segment was $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase in net loss of $10.4 million or 42% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $32.2 million decrease in noninterest income and a $2.6 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in net interest income and a $5.9 million increase in the benefit for income taxes. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the OTTI losses on available-for-sale securities and a decrease in gains related to the sale of bank properties, BOLI income, income due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and insurance proceeds from severe weather which affected the Hawaiian Islands, partially offset by an increase in net gains recognized in income related to derivative contracts. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase in occupancy expense, salaries and employee benefits expense, contracted services and professional fees, charitable contributions and a loss on our funding swap related to a decrease in the conversion rate of our Visa Class B restricted shares sold in 2016. This was partially offset by a decrease in pension-related expenses and advertisings costs. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits as a result of higher average balances in our loan portfolio, partially offset by higher expense charges as a result of higher average balances and margins in our deposit portfolio. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the reduction of the corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The decrease in total assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to a decrease in our investment securities portfolio.\nNet loss for the Treasury and Other segment was $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease in net loss of $2.7 million or 10% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a $27.1 million decrease in net interest expense and a $6.6 million decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $20.5 million decrease in noninterest income and a $10.4 million decrease in the benefit for income taxes. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to higher earnings credits as a result of higher average balances in our loan portfolio and higher average balances and yields in our investment securities portfolio. The decrease in noninterest expense\nwas primarily due to lower allocated expenses and contracted services and professional fees, partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits expense and occupancy expense. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a $22.7 million net gain on the sale of 274,000 Visa Class B restricted shares in 2016, partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate. The decrease in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets under the Tax Act in 2017. The increase in total assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to an increase in investment securities.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to our ability to maintain cash flow that is adequate to fund operations and meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength. Our objective is to manage our cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost.\nLiquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit, deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements and off balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory and internal guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability and off balance sheet positions. The Company's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.\nImmediate liquid resources are available in cash which is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB\u201d). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $1.0 billion. Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. The carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities were $4.5 billion and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we maintained our excess liquidity primarily in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or to help offset reductions in our deposit funding base. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLB\u201d) and the FRB. As of December 31, 2018, we have borrowing capacity of $1.3 billion from the FHLB and $671.8 million from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, advances totaling $600 million were issued from the FHLB.\nOur core deposits have historically provided us with a long term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. Our core deposits, defined as all deposits exclusive of time deposits exceeding $250,000, totaled $15.3 billion and $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, which represented 89% and 83%, respectively, of our total deposits. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company. While we consider core deposits to be less volatile, deposit levels could decrease if interest rates increase significantly or if corporate customers increase investing activities and reduce deposit balances.\nThe Company's routine funding requirements are expected to consist primarily of general corporate needs and capital to be returned to our shareholders. We expect to meet these obligations from dividends paid by the Bank to the Parent. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include selling residential real estate loans in the secondary market, short-term borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities.\nInvestment Securities\nTable 6 presents the estimated fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 66: <table> <tr>

decrease of $736.3 million or 14% compared to December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to our use of paydowns and maturities to fund loan growth. Our available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss), unless a security is deemed to be OTTI.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we maintained all of our investment securities in the available-for-sale category recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, with $3.3 billion invested in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our available-for-sale portfolio also included $389.5 million in U.S. Treasury securities, $241.6 million in debt securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises (FHLB and Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation callable bonds), $562.4 million in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $19.9 million in debt securities issued by state and political subdivisions.\nWe continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities and change the composition of our investment securities portfolio.\nGross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $0.1 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Gross unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio were $142.2 million and $122.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Higher unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio were primarily due to higher market interest rates as of December 31, 2018, relative to\nwhen the investment securities were purchased. The higher gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to our collateralized mortgage obligations, the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates.\nWe conduct a regular assessment of our investment securities portfolio to determine whether any securities are OTTI. When assessing unrealized losses for OTTI, we consider the nature of the investment, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of unrealized losses, expected cash flows of underlying assets and market conditions. As of December 31, 2018, we intended to sell 48 investment securities with an aggregate book value of $898.2 million, primarily comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and longer duration collateralized mortgage obligations. As a result, we recorded a non-credit related OTTI write-down of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2019, the sale of these securities were executed and the proceeds were used to invest in securities to improve portfolio return, reposition interest rate risk, maintain liquidity and to diversify asset allocation.\nWe are required to hold non-marketable equity securities, comprised of FHLB stock, as a condition of our membership in the FHLB system. Our FHLB stock is accounted for at cost, which equals par or redemption value.

We also offer a variety of automobile dealer flooring lines to our customers in Hawaii and California to assist with the financing of their inventory. Commercial and industrial loans were $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $73.5 million or 2% from December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a higher volume of mainland and Hawaii loans. High levels of outstanding balances in this portfolio were reflective of a strong Hawaii economy, which has encouraged local businesses to expand and to reinvest in their businesses.\nCommercial real estate loans are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan to value ( LTV\u201d) ratios generally not exceeding 75% and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1. The commercial properties are predominantly apartments, neighborhood and grocery anchored retail, industrial, office, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business. Commercial real estate loans were $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $323.2 million or 12% from December 31, 2017. Strong demand for\ncommercial real estate lending activities was reflective of a strong real estate market in Hawaii and the demand by both investors and owner occupants to refinance and/or to acquire new real estate assets.\nConstruction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. Loans in this portfolio are primarily for the purchase of land, as well as for the development of commercial properties, single family homes and condominiums. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained by the Bank, the loan is reclassified to the commercial real estate or residential real estate classes of loans. Construction loans were $626.8 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.2 million or 1% from December 31, 2017 in part due to greater than expected prepayments.\nResidential real estate loans are generally secured by 1-4 unit residential properties and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income ( DTI\u201d) ratios, liquidity and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer fixed rate mortgage products and variable rate mortgage products with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth or tenth year, depending on the product and are based on LIBOR. Variable rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We generally do not offer interest-only, payment-option facilities, Alt-A loans or any product with negative amortization. Residential real estate loans were $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $349.6 million or 9% from December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $300.5 million or 9% increase in residential mortgages. Our portfolio of residential real estate loans continues to benefit from Hawaii's strong real estate market and continued demand for new housing developments in this relatively low interest rate environment.\nConsumer loans consist primarily of open- and closed-end direct and indirect credit facilities for personal, automobile and household purchases as well as credit card loans. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in consumer lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines, which include an evaluation of personal credit history, cash flow and collateral values based on existing market conditions. Consumer loans were $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $76.0 million or 5% from December 31, 2017. High levels of consumer outstanding balances were reflective of a strong Hawaii economy, higher statewide personal income and lower unemployment trends. These factors contribute to higher levels of consumer spending.\nLease financing consists of commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases. Underwriting of new lease transactions is based on our lending policy, including but not limited to an analysis of customer cash flows and secondary sources of repayment, including the value of leased equipment, the guarantors' cash flows and/or other credit enhancements. No new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Lease financing was $147.8 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $17.3 million or 10% from December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 4.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the discussion in Analysis of Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d of this MD&A for more information on our loan and lease portfolio.\nThe Company's loan and lease portfolio includes adjustable-rate loans, primarily tied to Prime and LIBOR, hybrid-rate loans, for which the initial rate is fixed for a period from one year to as much as ten years, and fixed rate loans,\nfor which the interest rate does not change through the life of the loan.

A loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We generally place a loan on non-accrual status when management believes that collection of principal or interest has become doubtful or when a loan or lease becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans on non-accrual status are generally classified as impaired, but not all impaired loans are necessarily placed on non-accrual status. See Note 5. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our credit quality indicators.\nFor purposes of managing credit risk and estimating the Allowance, management has identified three categories of loans (commercial, residential real estate and consumer) that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the Allowance. The categorization of loans for the evaluation of credit risk is specific to our credit risk evaluation process and these loan categories are not necessarily the same as the loan categories used for other evaluations of our loan portfolio. See Note 5. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our approach to estimating the Allowance.\nThe following tables and discussion address non-performing assets, loans and leases that are 90 days past due but are still accruing interest, impaired loans and loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring.\nNon-Performing Assets and Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and

<td>\n10,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe level of NPAs represents an indicator of the potential for future credit losses. NPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases and OREO. Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to OREO or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower's financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.\nTotal NPAs were $7.3 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.9 million or 28% from December 31, 2017. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases and OREO was 0.06% as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of 2 basis points from December 31, 2017. The decrease in total NPAs was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans and a $0.5 million decrease in residential mortgage non-accrual loans.\nThe largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. The level of these NPAs remains elevated due to a lengthy judicial foreclosure process in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2018, residential mortgage non-accrual loans were $4.6 million, a decrease of $0.5 million or 10% from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 26 loans with a weighted average current loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio of 70%.\nCommercial real estate non-accrual loans were $1.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million or 7% from December 31, 2017.\nCommercial and industrial non-accrual loans were $0.3 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.7 million or 91% from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to six commercial and industrial non-accrual loans totaling $2.4 million that were paid off in 2018.\nOREO represents property acquired as a result of borrower defaults on loans. OREO is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. OREO was $0.8 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was comprised of two residential properties as of December 31, 2018 and one residential property as of December 31, 2017.\nWe attribute the lower level of NPAs to strong general economic conditions in Hawaii, led by strong tourism and construction industries, relatively low unemployment and favorable real estate valuations. We have also continued to remain diligent in our collection and recovery efforts and have continued to seek new lending opportunities while maintaining sound judgment and underwriting practices.\nLoans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest. Loans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection.\nLoans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $6.4 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.0 million or 46% as compared to December 31, 2017. Consumer loans and home equity lines that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased by $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by decreases in delinquencies in our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For a loan that has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refers to the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the modified loan agreement.\nImpaired loans were $30.6 million and $45.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These impaired loans had a related Allowance of $0.5 million as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in impaired loans during 2018 was primarily due to a net decrease of 10 commercial and industrial loans totaling $7.9 million and a net decrease of five commercial real estate loans totaling $4.1 million. The balance of impaired loans was also affected by charge-offs and paydowns. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded charge-offs of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to our total impaired loans. Our impaired loans are considered in management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the Allowance.\nIf interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2018 had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.5 million in additional interest income would have been recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018 and approximately $0.3 million in additional interest income would have been recorded for 2017. Actual interest income recorded on these loans was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTable 15 presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,251\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,850\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,101\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,394\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,394\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n36,495\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans modified in a TDR were $24.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a net decrease of $11.8 million or 32% from 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the net reduction of five commercial and industrial loans totaling $5.1 million and a net reduction of five commercial real estate loans of $4.1 million. This was further decreased by charge-offs and paydowns on existing loans. As of December 31, 2018, $24.0 million or 97% of our loans modified in a TDR were performing in accordance with their modified contractual terms and were on accrual status.\nGenerally, loans modified in a TDR are returned to accrual status after the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making six consecutive timely payments. See Note 5. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information and a description of the modification programs that we currently offer to our customers.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nWe maintain the Allowance at a level which, in our judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses that have been incurred in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Allowance consists of two components, allocated and unallocated. The allocated portion of the Allowance includes reserves that are allocated based on impairment analyses of specific loans or pools of loans. The unallocated component of the Allowance incorporates our judgment of the determination of the risks inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, economic uncertainties and imprecision in the estimation process. Although we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios and other relevant factors.\nTable 16 presents an analysis of our Allowance for the years

of $137.3 million or 1.12% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The level of the Allowance was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a strong Hawaii economy.\nNet charge-offs of loans and leases were $17.7 million or 0.14% of total average loans and leases outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $16.7 million or 0.14% for 2017. Net charge-offs in our commercial lending portfolio were $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net charge-offs of $0.2 million for 2017. Net recoveries in our residential lending portfolio were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net recoveries of $0.3 million for 2017. Our net recovery position in this portfolio segment is largely attributable to rising real estate prices in Hawaii. Net charge-offs in our consumer lending portfolio were $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net charge-offs of $16.8 million for 2017. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolio segment include those related to credit card, automobile loans, installment loans and small business lines of credit and reflect the inherent risk associated with these loans.\nAlthough we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios and other relevant factors.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the allocation of the Allowance to our commercial loans increased by $1.0 million or 2% from 2017 primarily due to an increase in commercial loans of $373.2 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the allocation of the Allowance to our residential real estate loan portfolio increased by $2.1 million or 5% from 2017 primarily due to an increase in residential loans of $349.6 million in 2018. Although there were increases in the allocation of Allowance to the commercial and residential lending portfolios, the Company reviews qualitative factors periodically to reflect changing conditions, which resulted in a net decrease in the allocated Allowance as a percentage of loan or lease category for both commercial loans and residential loans.\nSee Note 5. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the Allowance.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was $995.5 million as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our goodwill originated from the acquisition of BancWest by BNPP in December of 2001. Goodwill generated in that acquisition was recorded on the balance sheet of the Bank as a result of push down accounting treatment, and remains on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. Determining the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, includes assessing the current implied fair value of the reporting unit as if it were being acquired in a business combination and comparing it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. There was no impairment in our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2018. Future events that could cause a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in our business or the business climate may necessitate taking charges in future reporting periods related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOther Assets\nOther assets were $446.4 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $91.1 million or 26% from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $59.2 million increase in affordable housing and other tax credit investment partnership interests, a $31.9 million increase in interest-earning advances, a $24.0 million increase in our investment in FHLB Stock and a $12.9 million increase in prepaid expenses. This was partially offset by a $39.4 million decrease in current tax receivables and deferred tax assets.\nDeposits\nDeposits are the primary funding source for the Bank and are acquired from a broad base of local markets, including both individual and corporate customers. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time.\nTable 19 presents the composition of our deposits as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 19\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDemand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,007,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,126,853\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,853,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,509,419\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoney Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,196,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,801,968\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,092,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,173,882\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,150,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,612,122\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPublic time deposits were $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $962.3 million or 49% as compared to December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $462.1 million or 3% from December 31, 2017.

This was partially offset by a $394.7 million or 14% increase in money market deposit balances and a $343.9 million or 8% increase in savings deposit balances.\nTable 20 presents the amount of time deposits of $100,000 or more issued by the Company, further segregated by time remaining until maturity, as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDomestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nForeign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThree months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,165,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,211,058\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver three through six months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n329,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n354,349\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver six through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n448,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n503,012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n207,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n281,757\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,150,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n199,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,350,176\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term Borrowings\nLong-term borrowings were $600.0 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $600.0 million from December 31, 2017 due to the execution of FHLB fixed-rate advances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.80% and maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2024. The increase in long-term fixed rate borrowings was primarily to fund loan growth and to fix liability costs during a period of rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, the available remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.3 billion. The FHLB fixed rate advances and remaining borrowing capacity were secured by residential real estate loan collateral as of December 31, 2018.\nPension and Postretirement Plan Obligations\nWe have a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan, a directors' retirement plan, a non-qualified pension plan for eligible directors and a postretirement benefit plan providing life insurance and healthcare benefits that we offer to our directors and employees, as applicable. The qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan and the directors' retirement plan are all frozen plans to new participants. To calculate annual pension costs, we use the following key variables: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate.\nPension and postretirement benefit plan obligations, net of pension plan assets was $119.2 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.0 million or 1% from December 31, 2017. The balance as of December 31, 2018 included retirement benefits payable of $127.9 million for the Company's underfunded plans, partially offset by pension plan assets for overfunded plans, recorded as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, of $8.7 million.\nSee Note 15. Benefit Plans\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nForeign Activities\nCross-border outstandings are defined as loans (including accrued interest), acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and any other monetary assets which are denominated in dollars or other non-local currency. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, aggregate cross-border outstandings in countries which amounted to 0.75% to 1% of our total consolidated assets totaled approximately $186.3 million and $177.3 million to Japan and $151.9 million to Canada, respectively. There were no cross-border outstandings in excess of 1% of our total consolidated assets.\nCapital\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the Capital Rules, implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Subject to a phase-in period for various provisions, the Capital Rules became effective for us and for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and \u2018\u2018Additional Tier 1 capital'' instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.\nThe phase-in period became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 when banks were required to maintain 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets. On that date, the deductions from CET1 capital were limited to 40% of the final phased-in deductions. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 will be phased-in over a five year period which began on January 1, 2015. Implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased-in over a four year period (increasing each subsequent January 1st by the same amount until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).\nAs of December 31, 2018, our capital levels remained characterized as well capitalized\u201d under the Capital Rules. Our regulatory capital ratios, calculated in accordance with the Capital Rules, are presented in Table 21 below. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2018 that management believes have changed either the Company's or the Bank's capital classifications.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRegulatory Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStockholders' Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,524,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,532,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGoodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n995,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n995,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(132,195)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(96,383)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,661,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,633,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowable Reserve for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n137,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,803,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,771,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-Weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,884,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,120,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nKey Regulatory Capital Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.97\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.45\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.97\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.45\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.99\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.50\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.72\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.52\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal stockholders' equity was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million or less than 1% from December 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily due to an increase of $131.8 million in treasury stock related to our share repurchases from BWC concurrent with secondary offerings completed in May and August 2018, dividends declared and paid to the Company's stockholders of $131.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and an increase of $15.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, primarily due to higher unrealized losses on our investment securities due to rising interest rates. This was partially offset by earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $264.4 million and equity-based awards of $6.1 million.\nIn January 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share on our outstanding shares. The dividend is to be paid on March 8, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2019.\nWe reclassified a credit balance of $20.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 based on our prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. If ASU No. 2018-02 had been adopted retrospectively, the CET1 Capital Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio would have both been 12.60%, the Total Capital Ratio would have been 13.65% and the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio would have been 8.62% as of December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low income housing tax credit investments in partnerships and limited liability companies. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity's net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. Based on our analysis, we have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs.\nGuarantees\nWe sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover: ownership of the loan; validity of the lien securing the loan; the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan; compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement; compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws; and other matters. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold was $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met in the origination of those loans. Upon receipt of a repurchase request, we work with investors to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred. We manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there was one repurchase of a residential mortgage loan of $0.7 million and there was one pending repurchase request of residential mortgage loans.\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained. We also service loans originated by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans, or loan modifications or short sales. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection\nagainst expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor. These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had no repurchase requests related to loan servicing activities, nor were there any pending repurchase requests as of December 31, 2018.\nAlthough to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. However, as of December 31, 2018, management believes that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus has not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases. As of December 31, 2018, 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current. We maintain ongoing communications with investors and continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in loans sold to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 22\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime certificates of deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,575,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n351,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n165,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,092,164\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n600,026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoncancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n65,082\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPostretirement benefit contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,526\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n61,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n121,355\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,639,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n831,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n280,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n143,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,894,153\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon; therefore, these items are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations. Postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the postretirement benefit plan. Actual contributions may differ from these estimates.\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits ( UTBs\u201d) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $144.1 million and $141.3 million, respectively. The increase in UTB was primarily due to additions related to previously identified tax positions. We are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As a result, our liability for UTBs is not disclosed in the table above.\nSee the discussion of credit, lease and other contractual commitments in Note 4. Loans and Leases\u201d and Note 18. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the Allowance, fair value estimates, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nWe perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our loan and lease portfolio to assess overall collectability.\nThe Allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process. There is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan and lease portfolio.\nManagement's evaluation of the adequacy of the Allowance is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the Allowance is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios and consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors and trends. While our methodology in establishing the Allowance attributes portions of the Allowance to the commercial, residential real estate and consumer portfolios, the entire Allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio.\nThe Allowance related to our commercial portfolio is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The Allowance related to our residential real estate portfolio is most sensitive to the accuracy of delinquency data. Further refinement of the Allowance related to the residential real estate portfolio requires management to evaluate the borrower's financial condition and collateral values, among other factors. The Allowance related to our consumer portfolio is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends.\nThe Allowance attributable to each portfolio also includes an unallocated amount for imprecision in the estimation process. Furthermore, the estimate of the Allowance may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan and lease balances outstanding and general economic conditions as evidenced by changes in interest rates, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings and real estate values. While no one factor is dominant, each has the ability to result in actual loan losses which differ from originally estimated amounts.\nSee Note 5. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data and - Analysis of Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d for more information on the Allowance.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $4.5 billion or 22% and $5.2 billion or 26%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $14.7 million or less than 1% and $20.5 million or less than 1%, respectively, of our total liabilities, consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $12.1 million and $15.1 million, respectively, was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and $2.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively, was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the liability which was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was related to the sale of our Visa Class B restricted shares in 2016. We recorded a derivative liability which requires payment to the buyer of the Visa Class B restricted shares in the event Visa further reduces the conversion rate to its publicly traded Visa Class A shares.\nOur third party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third party pricing service:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur third party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOn a monthly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to non-binding third party broker quotes, as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third party pricing service. We also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades relative to historic levels, as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets. As of December 31, 2018, management did not make adjustments to prices provided by our third party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOn an annual basis, to the extent available, we obtain and review independent auditor's reports from our third party pricing service related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness.

Our third party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on the composition of our investment securities portfolio, we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements by our third party pricing service. See Note 22. Fair Value\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our use of fair value estimates.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nWe use the following key variables to calculate annual pension costs: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate. Pension cost is directly affected by the number of employees eligible for pension benefits and their estimated compensation increases. To calculate estimated compensation increases, management reviews our salary increases each year and compares this data with industry information. For all pension and postretirement plan calculations, we use a measurement date of December 31.\nThe expected long-term rate of return was based on a calculated rate of return from average rates of return on various asset classes over a 20 year historical time horizon. Using long-term historical data allows the Company to capture multiple economic environments, which management believes is relevant when using historical returns. Net actuarial gains or losses that exceed a 5% corridor of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost on a straight-line basis over five years.\nIn estimating the projected benefit obligation, an independent actuary bases assumptions on factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and other assumptions related to the population of individuals in the pension plan. If significant actuarial gains or losses occur, the actuary reviews the demographic and economic assumptions with management, at which time the Company considers revising these assumptions based on actual results.\nOur determination of the pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash inflows for maturities and return on plan assets. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. The discount rate assumption is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate assumption used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year end is the rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.\nSee Note 15. Benefit Plans\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our consolidated statements of income and balance sheets.\nFor example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes many significant amendments to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), including reducing the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax from 35% to 21%. The reduction in the corporate tax rate under the Tax Act required a one-time revaluation of certain of our tax-related assets. As such, we recorded approximately $47.6 million of additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nManagement's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe are also required to record a liability for UTBs for the entire amount of a tax benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our liabilities for UTBs were $144.1 million and $141.3 million, respectively. See Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on income taxes.\nFuture Application of Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not adopted by us as of December 31, 2018, see Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.\nRisk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management and operational risk. See Analysis of Financial Condition - Liquidity\u201d and -Capital\u201d sections of MD&A for further discussions of liquidity risk management and capital management, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management also includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial, real estate and consumer credit policies, risk ratings and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers' borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.\nManagement has identified three categories of loans that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the Allowance: commercial, residential real estate and consumer.\nCommercial lending is further categorized into four distinct classes based on characteristics relating to the borrower, transaction and collateral. These classes are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes by medium to larger Hawaii based corporations, as well as U.S. mainland and international companies. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by non-real estate assets whereby the collateral is trading assets, enterprise value or inventory. As with many of our customers, our commercial and industrial loan customers are heavily dependent on tourism, government expenditures and real estate values. Commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate, including but not limited to structures and facilities to support activities designated as retail, health care, general office space, warehouse and industrial space. Our bank's underwriting policy generally requires that net cash flows from the property be sufficient to service the debt while still\nmaintaining an appropriate amount of reserves. Commercial real estate loans in Hawaii are characterized by having a limited supply of real estate at commercially attractive locations, long delivery time frames for development and high interest rate sensitivity. Our construction lending portfolio consists primarily of land loans, single family and condominium development loans. Financing of construction loans is subject to a high degree of credit risk given the long delivery time frames for such projects. Construction lending activities are underwritten on a project financing basis whereby the cash flows or lease rents from the underlying real estate collateral or the sale of the finished inventory is the primary source of repayment. Market feasibility analysis is typically performed by assessing market comparables, market conditions and demand in the specific lending area and general community. We require presales of finished inventory prior to loan funding. However, because this analysis is typically performed on a forward looking basis, real estate construction projects typically present a higher risk profile in our lending activities. Lease financing activities include commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases used to purchase items ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. Underwriting of new leasing arrangements typically includes analyzing customer cash flows, evaluating secondary sources of repayment such as the value of the leased asset, the guarantors' net cash flows as well as other credit enhancements provided by the lessee.\nResidential real estate is further categorized into the following classes: residential mortgages (loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and home equity loans) and home equity lines of credit. Our bank's underwriting standards typically require LTV ratios of not more than 80%, although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance. First mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk, with an average loan size of approximately $335,000. Residential mortgage loan production is added to our loan portfolio or is sold in the secondary market, based on management's evaluation of our liquidity, capital and loan portfolio mix as well as market conditions. Changes in interest rates, the economic environment and other market factors have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, the marketability and value of collateral and the financial condition of our borrowers which impacts the level of credit risk inherent in this portfolio, although we remain a supply constrained housing environment in Hawaii. Geographic concentrations exist for this portfolio as nearly all residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are for residences located in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. These island locales are susceptible to a wide array of potential natural disasters including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes. We offer home equity lines of credit with variable rates; fixed rate options may be available post-closing. All lines are underwritten at 2% over the fully indexed rate. Our procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on repayment ability via debt-to-income ratios, LTV ratios and an evaluation of credit history.\nConsumer lending is further categorized into the following classes of loans: credit cards, automobile loans and other consumer-related installment loans. Consumer loans are either unsecured or secured by the borrower's personal assets. The average loan size is generally small and risk is diversified among many borrowers. We offer a wide array of credit cards for business and personal use. In general, our customers are attracted to our credit card offerings on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. Credit card underwriting decisions are generally based on repayment ability of our borrower via DTI ratios, credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and analysis of financial capacity. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate the majority of our automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan or lease. Although an applicant's creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured. Installment loans consist of open and closed end facilities for personal and household purchases. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in installment lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines which include an evaluation of personal credit history and cash flow.\nIn addition to geographic concentration risk, we also monitor our exposure to industry risk. While the Bank and our customers could be adversely impacted by events affecting the tourism industry, we also monitor our other industry exposures, including but not limited to our exposures in the oil, gas and energy industries. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have material exposures to customers in the oil, gas and energy industries.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the potential of loss arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates.\nThe potential cash flows, sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In the banking industry, changes in interest rates can significantly impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity.\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. This occurs when our interest earning loans and interest bearing deposits mature or reprice at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rates may also affect loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, pre- payment speeds and other items affecting earnings.\nMany factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe primarily use net interest income simulation analysis to measure and analyze interest rate risk. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis and compare these results against a measured base case scenario. Our net interest income simulation analysis incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments on and off balance sheet, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios and (6) overall increase or decrease in the size of the balance sheet and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset liability management strategies to manage our interest rate risk.\n\u2003\nTable 23 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from an immediate change in market interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged. We evaluate the sensitivity by using: 1) a dynamic forecast, incorporating expected changes in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast, where the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is held constant.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity Profile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTable 23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDynamic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStatic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDynamic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStatic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDynamic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStatic Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImmediate Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n11.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n10.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n11.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above shows the effects of a simulation which estimates the effect of an immediate and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve of \u2212100, +100 and +200 basis points in market interest rates over a twelve month period on our net interest income. One declining interest rate scenario and two rising interest rate scenarios were selected as shown in the table and net interest income was calculated and compared to the base case scenario, as described above.\nUnder the dynamic balance sheet forecasts as of December 31, 2018, the change in net interest income from the base case scenario was generally higher or more sensitive as compared to similar projections made as of December 31,\n2017. This was, in part, due to the replacement of short-term public time deposits with longer-term fixed rate FHLB Advances. Under the dynamic balance sheet forecasts as of December 31, 2017, the change in net interest income from the base case scenario was generally lower or less sensitive as compared to similar projections made as of December 31, 2016. This was, in part, due to our larger fixed rate investment securities portfolio as well as our larger fixed rate residential real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Generally, fixed rate investment securities and loan portfolios will not reprice as quickly in response to changes in market interest rates.\nUnder the static balance sheet forecasts, larger sensitivities are generally experienced under all scenarios as expected changes in the deposit mix are not reflected in the forecast over the next twelve months.\nWe also have longer term interest rate risk exposures which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income simulation analysis. We use market value of equity ( MVE\u201d) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital. MVE involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our MVE. MVE analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. The amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allows management to measure longer term repricing option risk in the balance sheet.\nWe also analyze the historical sensitivity of our interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year. This analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap\u201d between maturing assets and liabilities in each category.\nLimitations of Market Risk Measures\nThe results of our simulation analyses are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, our net interest income might vary significantly. Non parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause our net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short term liabilities re-price faster than expected or faster than our assets re-price. Actual results could differ from those projected if we grow assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if we experience a net outflow of deposits or if our mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. For example, while we maintain relatively large cash balances with the FRB, a faster than expected withdrawal of deposits out of the bank may cause us to seek higher cost sources of funding. Actual results could also differ from those projected if we experience substantially different prepayment speeds in our loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation analyses. Finally, these simulation results do not consider all the actions that we may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to our loan, investment, deposit, funding or hedging strategies.\nMarket Risk Governance\nWe seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from changes in market interest rates. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to increase net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.\nTo manage the impact on net interest income, we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates through our asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our ALCO and approved by our board of directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposures. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.\nThrough review and oversight by the ALCO, we attempt to engage in strategies that neutralize interest rate risk as much as possible. Our use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 17. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities\nportfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.\nManagement uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (such as natural disasters), or compliance, reputational or legal matters, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business ventures and the management of that risk is important to the achievement of our objectives. We have a framework in place that includes the reporting and assessment of any operational risk events, and the assessment of our mitigating strategies within our key business lines. This framework is implemented through our policies, processes and reporting requirements. We measure and report operational risk using the seven operational risk event types projected by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel II: (1) external fraud; (2) internal fraud; (3) employment practices and workplace safety; (4) clients, products and business practices; (5) damage to physical assets; (6) business disruption and system failures; and (7) execution, delivery and process management. Our operational risk review process is also a core part of our assessment of material new products or activities.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains, and from time to time our management may make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may,\u201d might,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d continue,\u201d will,\u201d anticipate,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d projection,\u201d would,\u201d annualized\u201d and outlook,\u201d or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nA number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including the following: the geographic concentration of our business; current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan in particular; concentrated exposures to certain asset classes and individual obligors; the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our business including our net interest income, net interest margin, the fair value of our investment securities, and our mortgage loan originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined; the possibility we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio; our inability to receive dividends from our bank, pay dividends to our common stockholders and satisfy obligations as they become due; the effects of geopolitical instability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and man-made and natural disasters; our ability to maintain our bank's reputation; our ability to attract and retain skilled employees or changes in our management personnel; our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies and the effects of competition in the financial services industry on our business; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; changes in the demand for our products and services; the effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; any failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks; the effect of a material breach of, or disruption to, the security of any of our or our vendors' systems; the failure to properly use and protect our customer and employee information and data; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; our ability to attract and retain customer deposits; the effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions; our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; our use of the secondary mortgage market as a source of liquidity; risks associated with the sale of loans and with our use of appraisals in valuing and monitoring loans; the possibility that actual results may differ from estimates and forecasts; the potential for environmental liability; fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures; the effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party; the impact of, and changes in, applicable laws, regulations and accounting standards and policies, including the enactment of the Tax Act (Public Law 115-97) on December 22, 2017; possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations; our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, litigation or regulatory actions; market perceptions associated with our separation from BNPP and other aspects of our business; our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock; contingent liabilities and unexpected tax liabilities that may be applicable to us as a result of the Reorganization Transactions; our ability to retain service providers to perform oversight or control functions or services that have otherwise been performed in the past by affiliates of BNPP; the one-time and incremental costs of operating as a stand-alone public company; our ability to meet our obligations as a public company, including our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and damage to our reputation from any of the factors described above.\nThe foregoing factors should not be considered an exhaustive list and should be read together with the other cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual\nresults may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nCompany Overview\nFHI, a bank holding company, owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of FHB. FHB was founded in 1858 under the name Bishop & Company and was the first successful banking partnership in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the second oldest bank formed west of the Mississippi River.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were the largest full service bank headquartered in Hawaii as measured by assets, loans and leases, deposits and net income. As of December 31, 2018, we had $20.7 billion of assets, $13.1 billion of gross loans and leases and $17.2 billion of deposits. We also generated $264.4 million of net income or diluted earnings per share of $1.93 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. We operate our business through three operating segments: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Treasury and Other. See Note 23. Reportable Operating Segments\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.\nReorganization Transactions\nOn April 1, 2016, BNPP effected the Reorganization Transactions pursuant to which FHI, which was then known as BancWest, contributed BOW, its subsidiary at the time, to BWHI, a newly formed bank holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. Upon formation, BWHI was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BancWest and, as part of the Reorganization Transactions, BancWest contributed 100% of its interest in BOW to BWHI. Following the contribution of BOW to BWHI, BancWest distributed its interest in BWHI to BNPP, and BWHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. As part of these transactions, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name to First Hawaiian, Inc., with the Bank remaining our only direct wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe Reorganization Transactions were made in connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP. On July 1, 2016, in order to comply with the Federal Reserve's requirement (under Regulation YY) applicable to BNPP that a foreign banking organization with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets as of June 30, 2015 establish a U.S. intermediate holding company and hold its interest in the substantial majority of its U.S. subsidiaries through the intermediate holding company by July 1, 2016, we became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA, BNPP's U.S. intermediate holding company. As part of that reorganization, we became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BWC, the BNPP selling stockholder and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA.\nPublic Offerings and Separation from BNPP\nShares of FHI's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol FHB\u201d on August 4, 2016. In August 2016, FHI completed its IPO of 24,250,000 shares of common stock sold by BWC. In February 2017, BWC sold an additional 28,750,000 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering. In May and June 2018, BWC sold an additional 16,830,000 shares of FHI common stock in the aggregate in a secondary offering. BWC sold 20,000,000 additional shares of FHI common stock in secondary offerings completed in each of August and September 2018, respectively. BWC sold shares of FHI common stock of 2,968,069 and 1,801,801 in May and August 2018, respectively, to the Company pursuant to share repurchase agreements. BWC sold 24,859,750 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering completed in February 2019. FHI did not receive any of the proceeds from the aforementioned sales of shares of its common stock by BWC. Following the completion of the secondary offering completed on February 1, 2019, BNPP (through BWC) fully exited its ownership interest in FHI common stock.\nUpon the completion of the August 2018 and September 2018 offerings, BNPP-directors Jean-Milan Givadinovitch, Xavier Antiglio and J. Michael Shepherd resigned from the board of directors. The FHI board of directors appointed Faye Kurren, Jenai Wall and C. Scott Wo to fill such vacancies. Following the completion of the February 2019 offering, Michel Vial and G\u00e9rard Gil, the remaining BNPP designees to the FHI board of directors, resigned from the board of directors. As a result, all directors designated by BNPP have resigned from the FHI board of directors.\nThe Company and/or Bank entered into contractual arrangements with BNPP and/or its affiliates to provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with BNPP, including a Stockholder Agreement, a Transitional Services Agreement, a Registration Rights Agreement, a License Agreement and an Insurance Agreement. Among other things, the Stockholder Agreement set forth certain agreements that governed the relationship between the Company and BNPP following the IPO until the Non-Control Date\u201d, which is defined in the Stockholder Agreement as the date on which BNPP ceases to control the Company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as provided for in a written determination from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or such earlier date as BNPP may designate in writing to the Company. On February 12, 2019, following the completion of BNPP's divestiture of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2019 and the resignation from the Company's board of directors of all remaining directors nominated by BNPP, under the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, the non-control date under the Stockholder Agreement occurred. As a result, BNPP's governance and consent rights under the Stockholder Agreement, and its substantive rights under the Registration Rights Agreement, have terminated.\nPursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement, BNPP, BWHI and BOW provided us with certain services they provided prior to the IPO either directly or on a pass-through basis, and we provided, or arranged to provide, BNPP, BWHI and BOW with certain services we provided to them prior to the IPO, either directly or on a pass-through basis. The Transitional Services Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018, although the provision of certain services terminated prior to the agreement termination date and certain other services continue to be provided beyond the agreement termination date as agreed by the parties. In connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental ongoing and one-time expenses, as well as increases in audit fees, insurance premiums, employee salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation expenses for employees and non-employee directors), and fees and expenses that may have been previously reimbursed by BNPP or its affiliates and consulting fees. These costs also include increases that we expect to result from the higher pricing of services by third-party vendors whose future contracts with us do not reflect BOW volumes or the benefits of BNPP bargaining power. Our one-time expenses incurred in connection with our IPO included professional fees, consulting fees and certain filing and listing fees. The actual amount of the incremental expenses we incur as a stand-alone public company may be higher, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons and there may be additional related costs we may incur that we have not currently anticipated.\nBasis of Presentation\nFor periods prior to April 1, 2016, the financial operations, assets and liabilities of BancWest (now known as First Hawaiian, Inc.) related to FHB (and not BOW) have been combined with FHB and are presented on a basis of accounting that reflects a change in reporting entity as if we were a separate stand-alone entity for all periods presented. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain assets of BancWest as agreed to by the parties and also certain expenses amounting to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, specifically applicable to the operations of BancWest related to FHB through the date of the Reorganization Transactions. Management believes these allocations are reasonable. Prior to April 1, 2016, the residual revenues and expenses not included in our consolidated financial statements represent those directly related to BWHI and BOW. The allocated expenses included in our consolidated financial statements, residual revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations of our company if we had operated as a stand-alone public entity during the reporting periods prior to April 1, 2016 and may not be indicative of our company's future results of operations and financial condition.\nUpon completion of the Reorganization Transactions on April 1, 2016, the consolidated financial statements of the Company reflected the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of FHI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, FHB. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any changes that may occur in our operations and expenses as a result of the Reorganization Transactions or our IPO.\nHawaii Economy\nHawaii's economy continued to perform well during the year ended December 31, 2018, led in large part by a strong tourism industry and growth in personal income and tax revenues, offsetting a slight decline in real estate and labor market conditions. Hawaii's tourism industry remained robust, achieving new records in 2018 in visitor arrivals and spending. Visitor arrivals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 5.9% compared to 2017, and total visitor spending for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 6.8% compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Tourism\nAuthority. Visitor arrivals and spending increased, in particular, from U.S. mainland and Canadian visitors. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 2.0% in December 2017 according to the Hawaii State Department of Labor & Industrial Relations. The national seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9% in December 2018 compared to 4.1% in December 2017. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased by 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased by 2.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Honolulu Board of Realtors. However, the median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu was $790,000 and $420,000, respectively, or an increase of 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively. Lastly, state general excise and use tax revenues increased by 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Department of Taxation.\nHawaii's economy continued to grow during 2018, but is significantly dependent on U.S. mainland economic conditions as well as key international economies, particularly Japan. We continue to monitor construction activity in Hawaii and the local economy's ability to absorb further planned expansion given deteriorating home affordability, tourism in Hawaii, the movement of interest rates in the U.S., the agenda of the U.S. administration and its impact on existing banking regulations, changes in Japan's economic conditions including the exchange rate of its currency, and the economic and regulatory conditions of the European Union, as such factors could impact our profitability in future reporting periods.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet income was $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $80.7 million or 44% as compared to the same period in 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.61 or 46% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for income taxes and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $24.1 million OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Core net income was $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $56.3 million or 24% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $2.09 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.44 or 27% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nNet income was $183.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $46.5 million or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.32 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.33 or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for income taxes, a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $47.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes as a result of the Tax Act. Core net income was $230.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.3 million or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.09 or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 1.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 39 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 10.76% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 352 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. Our return on average tangible assets was 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 18.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 617 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. We continued to manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 48.96% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47.32% for the same period in 2017. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 27 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 7.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 172 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. Our return on average tangible assets was 0.97% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 29 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 11.91% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 273 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. We continued to prudently manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 47.32% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 46.99% for the same period in 2016. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was favorably impacted by net gains on the sale of investment securities of $27.3 million. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2018 were highlighted by the following:\n \u00b7 Net interest income was $566.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $37.5 million or 7% as compared to the same period in 2017. Our net interest margin was 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 17 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average balances and yields in most loan categories and higher yields in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio and higher deposit funding costs. \n \u00b7 The Provision was $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.7 million or 20% as compared to the same period in 2017. The Provision is recorded to maintain the Allowance at levels deemed adequate to absorb probable credit losses that have been incurred in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income was $179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $26.6 million or 13% as compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $24.1 million in OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities, a $4.1 million decrease in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income, a $3.8 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts and a $1.4 million decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in other service charges and fees and a $1.7 million increase in credit and debit card fees. \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $365.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.4 million or 5% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in other noninterest expense, a $4.8 million increase in contracted services and professional fees, a $4.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.8 million increase in occupancy and $1.5 million increase in card rewards program expenses, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses. \nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were highlighted by the following:\n \u00b7 Net interest income was $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million or 8% as compared to the same period in 2016. Our net interest margin was 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to strong loan growth and an increase in average balances and yields on our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average balances in interest-bearing deposits at higher rates. \n \u00b7 The Provision was $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.9 million as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in the Provision maintained the Allowance at levels deemed adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses as of the balance sheet date. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income was $205.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $20.4 million or 9% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.7 million net gain on the sale of 274,000 shares of our Visa Class B restricted shares during the year ended December 31, 2016 that did not recur in 2017, partially offset by an $11.6 million increase in other noninterest income. \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $347.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $1.9 million increase in regulatory assessment and fees and a $1.9 million increase in occupancy expenses. \nDuring 2018, we used long-term borrowings and the proceeds from maturing investment securities to fund loan growth and a planned reduction in public time deposits. We continued to maintain adequate reserves for credit losses and high levels of liquidity and capital.\n \u00b7 Total loans and leases were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $798.8 million or 7% as compared to December 31, 2017. Growth was particularly strong in our commercial real estate and residential real estate mortgage portfolios. This was a reflection of a strong Hawaii economy, which has encouraged local businesses to expand and to reinvest in their businesses and sustained continued demand by both investors and owner occupants to acquire new real estate assets. \n \u00b7 The Allowance was $141.7 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.5 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. The ratio of our Allowance to total loans and leases outstanding decreased to 1.08% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2017. The Allowance was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a strong Hawaii economy. \n \u00b7 We continued to hold high-grade investment securities, primarily collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The total fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $736.3 million or 14% compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our use of paydowns and maturities to fund loan growth. \n \u00b7 Total deposits were $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $462.1 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a $962.3 million decrease in public time deposits, partially offset by $394.7 million increase in money market deposit balances and a $343.9 million increase in savings deposit balances. \n \u00b7 Finally, total stockholders' equity was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily due to an increase of $131.8 million in treasury stock related to our share repurchases from BWC concurrent with secondary offerings completed in May and August 2018, dividends declared and paid to the Company's stockholders of $131.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and an increase of $15.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, primarily due to higher unrealized losses on our investment securities due to rising interest rates. This was partially offset by earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $264.4 million and equity-based awards of $6.1 million. \nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, average balances, related income and expenses, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 1. An analysis of the change in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, is presented in Table 2.\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual\nresults may differ materially from what we anticipate.

FHB was founded in 1858 under the name Bishop & Company and was the first successful banking partnership in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the second oldest bank formed west of the Mississippi River.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were the largest full service bank headquartered in Hawaii as measured by assets, loans and leases, deposits and net income. As of December 31, 2018, we had $20.7 billion of assets, $13.1 billion of gross loans and leases and $17.2 billion of deposits. We also generated $264.4 million of net income or diluted earnings per share of $1.93 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. We operate our business through three operating segments: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Treasury and Other. See Note 23. Reportable Operating Segments\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.\nReorganization Transactions\nOn April 1, 2016, BNPP effected the Reorganization Transactions pursuant to which FHI, which was then known as BancWest, contributed BOW, its subsidiary at the time, to BWHI, a newly formed bank holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. Upon formation, BWHI was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BancWest and, as part of the Reorganization Transactions, BancWest contributed 100% of its interest in BOW to BWHI. Following the contribution of BOW to BWHI, BancWest distributed its interest in BWHI to BNPP, and BWHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNPP. As part of these transactions, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name to First Hawaiian, Inc., with the Bank remaining our only direct wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe Reorganization Transactions were made in connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP. On July 1, 2016, in order to comply with the Federal Reserve's requirement (under Regulation YY) applicable to BNPP that a foreign banking organization with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets as of June 30, 2015 establish a U.S. intermediate holding company and hold its interest in the substantial majority of its U.S. subsidiaries through the intermediate holding company by July 1, 2016, we became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA, BNPP's U.S. intermediate holding company. As part of that reorganization, we became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BWC, the BNPP selling stockholder and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA.\nPublic Offerings and Separation from BNPP\nShares of FHI's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol FHB\u201d on August 4, 2016. In August 2016, FHI completed its IPO of 24,250,000 shares of common stock sold by BWC. In February 2017, BWC sold an additional 28,750,000 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering. In May and June 2018, BWC sold an additional 16,830,000 shares of FHI common stock in the aggregate in a secondary offering. BWC sold 20,000,000 additional shares of FHI common stock in secondary offerings completed in each of August and September 2018, respectively. BWC sold shares of FHI common stock of 2,968,069 and 1,801,801 in May and August 2018, respectively, to the Company pursuant to share repurchase agreements. BWC sold 24,859,750 shares of FHI common stock in a secondary offering completed in February 2019. FHI did not receive any of the proceeds from the aforementioned sales of shares of its common stock by BWC. Following the completion of the secondary offering completed on February 1, 2019, BNPP (through BWC) fully exited its ownership interest in FHI common stock.\nUpon the completion of the August 2018 and September 2018 offerings, BNPP-directors Jean-Milan Givadinovitch, Xavier Antiglio and J. Michael Shepherd resigned from the board of directors. The FHI board of directors appointed Faye Kurren, Jenai Wall and C. Scott Wo to fill such vacancies. Following the completion of the February 2019 offering, Michel Vial and G\u00e9rard Gil, the remaining BNPP designees to the FHI board of directors, resigned from the board of directors. As a result, all directors designated by BNPP have resigned from the FHI board of directors.\nThe Company and/or Bank entered into contractual arrangements with BNPP and/or its affiliates to provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with BNPP, including a Stockholder Agreement, a Transitional Services Agreement, a Registration Rights Agreement, a License Agreement and an Insurance Agreement. Among other things, the Stockholder Agreement set forth certain agreements that governed the relationship between the Company and BNPP following the IPO until the Non-Control Date\u201d, which is defined in the Stockholder Agreement as the date on which BNPP ceases to control the Company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as provided for in a written determination from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or such earlier date as BNPP may designate in writing to the Company. On February 12, 2019, following the completion of BNPP's divestiture of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2019 and the resignation from the Company's board of directors of all remaining directors nominated by BNPP, under the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, the non-control date under the Stockholder Agreement occurred. As a result, BNPP's governance and consent rights under the Stockholder Agreement, and its substantive rights under the Registration Rights Agreement, have terminated.\nPursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement, BNPP, BWHI and BOW provided us with certain services they provided prior to the IPO either directly or on a pass-through basis, and we provided, or arranged to provide, BNPP, BWHI and BOW with certain services we provided to them prior to the IPO, either directly or on a pass-through basis. The Transitional Services Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018, although the provision of certain services terminated prior to the agreement termination date and certain other services continue to be provided beyond the agreement termination date as agreed by the parties. In connection with our transition to a stand-alone public company and our separation from BNPP, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, incremental ongoing and one-time expenses, as well as increases in audit fees, insurance premiums, employee salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation expenses for employees and non-employee directors), and fees and expenses that may have been previously reimbursed by BNPP or its affiliates and consulting fees. These costs also include increases that we expect to result from the higher pricing of services by third-party vendors whose future contracts with us do not reflect BOW volumes or the benefits of BNPP bargaining power. Our one-time expenses incurred in connection with our IPO included professional fees, consulting fees and certain filing and listing fees. The actual amount of the incremental expenses we incur as a stand-alone public company may be higher, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons and there may be additional related costs we may incur that we have not currently anticipated.\nBasis of Presentation\nFor periods prior to April 1, 2016, the financial operations, assets and liabilities of BancWest (now known as First Hawaiian, Inc.) related to FHB (and not BOW) have been combined with FHB and are presented on a basis of accounting that reflects a change in reporting entity as if we were a separate stand-alone entity for all periods presented. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain assets of BancWest as agreed to by the parties and also certain expenses amounting to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, specifically applicable to the operations of BancWest related to FHB through the date of the Reorganization Transactions. Management believes these allocations are reasonable. Prior to April 1, 2016, the residual revenues and expenses not included in our consolidated financial statements represent those directly related to BWHI and BOW. The allocated expenses included in our consolidated financial statements, residual revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations of our company if we had operated as a stand-alone public entity during the reporting periods prior to April 1, 2016 and may not be indicative of our company's future results of operations and financial condition.\nUpon completion of the Reorganization Transactions on April 1, 2016, the consolidated financial statements of the Company reflected the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of FHI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, FHB. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any changes that may occur in our operations and expenses as a result of the Reorganization Transactions or our IPO.\nHawaii Economy\nHawaii's economy continued to perform well during the year ended December 31, 2018, led in large part by a strong tourism industry and growth in personal income and tax revenues, offsetting a slight decline in real estate and labor market conditions. Hawaii's tourism industry remained robust, achieving new records in 2018 in visitor arrivals and spending. Visitor arrivals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 5.9% compared to 2017, and total visitor spending for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 6.8% compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Tourism\nAuthority. Visitor arrivals and spending increased, in particular, from U.S. mainland and Canadian visitors. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 2.0% in December 2017 according to the Hawaii State Department of Labor & Industrial Relations. The national seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9% in December 2018 compared to 4.1% in December 2017. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased by 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased by 2.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Honolulu Board of Realtors. However, the median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu was $790,000 and $420,000, respectively, or an increase of 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively. Lastly, state general excise and use tax revenues increased by 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 according to the Hawaii Department of Taxation.\nHawaii's economy continued to grow during 2018, but is significantly dependent on U.S. mainland economic conditions as well as key international economies, particularly Japan. We continue to monitor construction activity in Hawaii and the local economy's ability to absorb further planned expansion given deteriorating home affordability, tourism in Hawaii, the movement of interest rates in the U.S., the agenda of the U.S. administration and its impact on existing banking regulations, changes in Japan's economic conditions including the exchange rate of its currency, and the economic and regulatory conditions of the European Union, as such factors could impact our profitability in future reporting periods.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet income was $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $80.7 million or 44% as compared to the same period in 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.61 or 46% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for income taxes and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $24.1 million OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Core net income was $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $56.3 million or 24% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $2.09 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.44 or 27% as compared to the same period in 2017. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nNet income was $183.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $46.5 million or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.32 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.33 or 20% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for income taxes, a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the Provision, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $47.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes as a result of the Tax Act. Core net income was $230.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13.3 million or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.09 or 6% as compared to the same period in 2016. Core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for core net income and core basic and diluted earnings per share, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 1.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 39 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 10.76% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 352 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. Our return on average tangible assets was 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 40 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 18.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 617 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. We continued to manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 48.96% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 47.32% for the same period in 2017. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur return on average total assets was 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 27 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average total stockholders' equity was 7.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 172 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. Our return on average tangible assets was 0.97% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 29 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016, and our return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 11.91% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 273 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. We continued to prudently manage our expenses as our efficiency ratio was 47.32% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 46.99% for the same period in 2016. The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was favorably impacted by net gains on the sale of investment securities of $27.3 million. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders' equity, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data - GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2018 were highlighted by the following:\n \u00b7 Net interest income was $566.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $37.5 million or 7% as compared to the same period in 2017. Our net interest margin was 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 17 basis points as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average balances and yields in most loan categories and higher yields in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio and higher deposit funding costs. \n \u00b7 The Provision was $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.7 million or 20% as compared to the same period in 2017. The Provision is recorded to maintain the Allowance at levels deemed adequate to absorb probable credit losses that have been incurred in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income was $179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $26.6 million or 13% as compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $24.1 million in OTTI losses on available-for-sale debt securities, a $4.1 million decrease in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income, a $3.8 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts and a $1.4 million decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in other service charges and fees and a $1.7 million increase in credit and debit card fees. \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $365.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.4 million or 5% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in other noninterest expense, a $4.8 million increase in contracted services and professional fees, a $4.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.8 million increase in occupancy and $1.5 million increase in card rewards program expenses, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses. \nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were highlighted by the following:\n \u00b7 Net interest income was $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million or 8% as compared to the same period in 2016. Our net interest margin was 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11 basis points as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to strong loan growth and an increase in average balances and yields on our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average balances in interest-bearing deposits at higher rates. \n \u00b7 The Provision was $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.9 million as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in the Provision maintained the Allowance at levels deemed adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses as of the balance sheet date. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income was $205.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $20.4 million or 9% as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.7 million net gain on the sale of 274,000 shares of our Visa Class B restricted shares during the year ended December 31, 2016 that did not recur in 2017, partially offset by an $11.6 million increase in other noninterest income. \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $347.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million or 3% as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $1.9 million increase in regulatory assessment and fees and a $1.9 million increase in occupancy expenses. \nDuring 2018, we used long-term borrowings and the proceeds from maturing investment securities to fund loan growth and a planned reduction in public time deposits. We continued to maintain adequate reserves for credit losses and high levels of liquidity and capital.\n \u00b7 Total loans and leases were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $798.8 million or 7% as compared to December 31, 2017. Growth was particularly strong in our commercial real estate and residential real estate mortgage portfolios. This was a reflection of a strong Hawaii economy, which has encouraged local businesses to expand and to reinvest in their businesses and sustained continued demand by both investors and owner occupants to acquire new real estate assets. \n \u00b7 The Allowance was $141.7 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $4.5 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. The ratio of our Allowance to total loans and leases outstanding decreased to 1.08% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.12% as of December 31, 2017. The Allowance was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a strong Hawaii economy. \n \u00b7 We continued to hold high-grade investment securities, primarily collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The total fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $736.3 million or 14% compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to our use of paydowns and maturities to fund loan growth. \n \u00b7 Total deposits were $17.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $462.1 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a $962.3 million decrease in public time deposits, partially offset by $394.7 million increase in money market deposit balances and a $343.9 million increase in savings deposit balances. \n \u00b7 Finally, total stockholders' equity was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $7.7 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily due to an increase of $131.8 million in treasury stock related to our share repurchases from BWC concurrent with secondary offerings completed in May and August 2018, dividends declared and paid to the Company's stockholders of $131.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and an increase of $15.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, primarily due to higher unrealized losses on our investment securities due to rising interest rates. This was partially offset by earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $264.4 million and equity-based awards of $6.1 million. \nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, average balances, related income and expenses, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 1.
