This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and after our election to be treated as a RIC, limitations imposed by the Code. We were formed in September 2020 as a Delaware limited liability company and converted to a Maryland corporation effective July 1, 2021.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $40.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2021, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2021, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following: Table 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,568,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop </td> <td> </td> <td>16,067,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>172,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,990,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans or recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2021, one stop loans included $1,595,963 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had debt and equity investments in 29 portfolio companies. The following table shows the weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our DRIP in each case for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average income yield(1)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average investment income yield(2)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on average net asset value(3) *\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on net asset value per share(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Annualized for periods less than one year.\n(1)Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(2)Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(3)Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load.\n(4)Total return based on net asset value per share assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK, interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the\nform of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments or derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n\u2022reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $0.7 million;\n\u2022calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n\u2022fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\n\u2022expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n\u2022administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\n\u2022fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\n\u2022transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n\u2022U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022independent directors' fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n\u2022costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n\u2022costs associated with individual or group stockholders;\n\u2022costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n\u2022proxy voting expenses; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19, which was identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020, resulted in governmental authorities imposing restrictions on travel and the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, restaurants, healthcare facilities, fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions. While several countries, as well as certain states in the United States, have lifted or reduced certain travel restrictions, business closures and other quarantine measures and recurring COVID-19 outbreaks have led to the re-introduction of such restrictions in certain states in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions elsewhere. In early 2021, COVID-19 vaccines started to be administered to high-risk adults and essential workers across the United States and eligibility to receive the vaccine has since expanded to all adults in most states. Although we believe the number of vaccinated adults in the United States is promising for continued reductions of travel restrictions and other quarantine measures, we are unable to predict the duration of business and supply chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and GC Advisors continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and future recommendations from such authorities may further impact our business operations and financial results. Due to the resurgence of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants of COVID-19, we remain cautious and concerned about the on-going impacts to the U.S. economy from COVID-19.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 18, 2021, we notified stockholders of a capital call due on October 28, 2021. The estimated shares and proceeds are summarized in the table below: Table 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares Issued </td> <td> </td> <td>NAV ($) per share </td> <td> </td> <td>Proceeds </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of Shares </td> <td>10/28/2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>673,368.333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,100,525 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 5, 2021 and November 19, 2021, the Board declared distributions to holders of record as set forth in the table below:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount Per Share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 5, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 22, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations earned by us (if positive) as determined in accordance with GAAP for the period September 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021 per share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 18, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 22, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations earned by us (if positive) as determined in accordance with GAAP, for the period October 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021 per share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 27, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>In an amount (if positive) such that our net asset value as of November 30, 2021 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations earned by us (if positive) as determined in accordance with GAAP for the period November 1, 2021 through November 30, 2021 and the payment of this dividend is $15.00 per share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 20, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In an amount (if positive) such that our net asset value as of December 31, 2021 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations earned by us (if positive) as determined in accordance with GAAP for the period December 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the payment of this dividend is $15.00 per share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 20, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 23, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations earned by us (if positive) as determined in accordance with GAAP for the period January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2022 per share\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 15, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement on the Adviser Revolver (as defined in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements) with GC Advisors to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity under the Adviser Revolver from $40,000,000 to $70,000,000 and permit us to borrow under the Adviser Revolver in foreign currencies. The other material terms of the Adviser Revolver were unchanged.\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into an agreement with GC Advisors to waive any reimbursement by us for any operating expenses that GC Advisors or its affiliates incur on our behalf during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the period from July 1, 2021

foreign currency transactions of $80,059.\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021, we had $26,332 in unrealized appreciation on 5 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $95,626 in unrealized depreciation on 24 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021 primarily resulted from fees collected that decrease the cost of the investments and are amortized through the investment's maturity. Unrealized depreciation for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021 primarily resulted from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates for our foreign denominated investments for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021, we experienced a net increase in cash and foreign currencies of $29,661,798. During the period, we used $22,984,720 in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $26,877,150, partially offset by proceeds from principal payments of portfolio investments of $3,870,853. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was $52,646,518, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $16,350,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of $36,360,630, that were partially offset by distributions paid of $64,112.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $29,432,086 of cash and $158,327 of foreign currencies. Cash and foreign currencies are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had investor capital subscriptions totaling $202,010,500, respectively, of which $36,371,130, respectively, had been called and contributed, leaving $165,639,370 of uncalled investor capital subscriptions, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nAdviser Revolver - As of September 30, 2021, we were permitted to borrow up to $40,000,000 at any one time outstanding under the Adviser Revolver. As of September 30, 2021, we had outstanding debt of $16,350,000 under the Adviser Revolver. On November 15, 2021, we entered into an amendment to increase borrowing capacity under the Adviser Revolver from $40,000,000 to $70,000,000 and permit us to borrow under the Adviser Revolver in foreign currencies.\nAsset Coverage, Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. We have not sought or obtained approval to reduce our asset coverage ratio as permitted by and subject to the requirements of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and, as a result, remain subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement under Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2021, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 321.9%.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $6,196,567, including $2,015,644 of commitments on undrawn revolvers. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2021 subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. A summary of maturity requirements for our principal borrowings under the Adviser Revolver as of September 30, 2021 is included in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. We did not have any other material contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on the cash balances that we maintain, availability under our Adviser Revolver, ongoing principal repayments on debt investment assets and uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through net proceeds from capital calls on existing and future investor capital subscriptions and through our dividend reinvestment plan as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, we can amend, refinance, or enter into new leverage facilities. In addition to capital not being available, it also could not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we expect to receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had investments in 29 portfolio companies with a total fair value of $22,990,132.\nThe

For additional information on distributions, see Critical Accounting Policies - Income Taxes.\u201d\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations can differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences are permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions could be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders could be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n\u2022We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Each of Mr. Lawrence Golub, our chairman, and Mr. David Golub, our president and chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors, and each of Messrs. Lawrence Golub and David Golub owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors.\n\u2022GC Advisors voluntarily agreed to waive reimbursement from us for operating expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 and for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Golub Capital LLC provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement.\n\u2022We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital.\u201d\n\u2022Under the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC has agreed to provide GC Advisors with the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC will make available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provide access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of GC Advisors' investment committee will serve in such capacity. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided on a direct cost reimbursement basis. We are not a party to the Staffing Agreement.\n\u2022We have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis.\n\u2022As of September 30, 2021, GGP Holdings LP, an affiliate of GC Advisors, had an aggregate commitment to us of $102,010,500. As of September 30, 2021, we have issued 1,224,742.000 shares of our common stock to GGP Holdings LP in exchange for aggregate capital contributions totaling $18,371,130.\nGC Advisors also sponsors or manages, and expects in the future to sponsor or manage, other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles (together referred to as accounts\u201d) that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly-traded business development company (Nasdaq: GBDC) and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., both of which focus on investing primarily in one stop and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. If GC Advisors and its affiliates determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for other such accounts, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors' allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates could determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors' allocation procedures.\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nValuation methods include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments can differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and differ materially from values that are ultimately received or settled.\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets' or liabilities' complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset's or a liability's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the\nfair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, and it is expected that approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of the Company's valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations will be subject to review by an independent valuation firm and each portfolio company will be subject to review at least once on during a trailing twelve-month period. Investments originated during the three months ended September 30, 2021 were not subject to review by an independent valuation firm. As of September 30, 2021, all investments were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. A portfolio company's EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nIn connection with each sale of shares of our common stock, we make a determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of common stock at the time at\nwhich the sale is made or otherwise in violation of the 1940 Act. GC Advisors will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination:\n\u2022The net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report filed with the SEC;\n\u2022Its assessment of whether any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share of our common stock and ending two days prior to the date of the sale; and\n\u2022The magnitude of the difference between the sale price of the shares of common stock and management's assessment of any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock during the period discussed above.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using applicable implied market rates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and, in our management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2021, we had no portfolio company investments on non-accrual status.\nIncome taxes:\nWe intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and will operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021, we did not incur any U.S federal excise tax.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.", "summary": "The report provides information about Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures\nthat we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and after our election to be treated as a RIC, limitations imposed by the Code. We were formed in September 2020 as a Delaware limited liability company and converted to a Maryland corporation effective July 1, 2021.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $40.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2021, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2021, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following: \nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans or recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2021, one stop loans included $1,595,963 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had debt and equity investments in 29 portfolio companies. The following table shows the weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our DRIP in each case for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021:\n\n \n* Annualized for periods less than one year.\n(1)Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(2)Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(3)Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load.\n(4)Total return based on net asset value per share assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK, interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the\nform of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments or derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n\u2022reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $0.7 million;\n\u2022calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n\u2022fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\n\u2022expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n\u2022administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\n\u2022fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\n\u2022transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n\u2022U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022independent directors' fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n\u2022costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n\u2022costs associated with individual or group stockholders;\n\u2022costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n\u2022proxy voting expenses; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19, which was identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020, resulted in governmental authorities imposing restrictions on travel and the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, restaurants, healthcare facilities, fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions. While several countries, as well as certain states in the United States, have lifted or reduced certain travel restrictions, business closures and other quarantine measures and recurring COVID-19 outbreaks have led to the re-introduction of such restrictions in certain states in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions elsewhere. In early 2021, COVID-19 vaccines started to be administered to high-risk adults and essential workers across the United States and eligibility to receive the vaccine has since expanded to all adults in most states. Although we believe the number of vaccinated adults in the United States is promising for continued reductions of travel restrictions and other quarantine measures, we are unable to predict the duration of business and supply chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and GC Advisors continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and future recommendations from such authorities may further impact our business operations and financial results. Due to the resurgence of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants of COVID-19, we remain cautious and concerned about the on-going impacts to the U.S. economy from COVID-19.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 18, 2021, we notified stockholders of a capital call due on October 28, 2021. The estimated shares and proceeds are summarized in the table below: \nOn October 5, 2021 and November 19, 2021, the Board declared distributions to holders of record as set forth in the table below:\n\nOn November 15, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement on the Adviser Revolver (as defined in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements) with GC Advisors to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity under the Adviser Revolver from $40,000,000 to $70,000,000 and permit us to borrow under the Adviser Revolver in foreign currencies. The other material terms of the Adviser Revolver were unchanged.\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into an agreement with GC Advisors to waive any reimbursement by us for any operating expenses that GC Advisors or its affiliates incur on our behalf during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021, are as follows:\n\nAs we commenced operations on July 1, 2021, no income was earned prior to July 1, 2021.\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021:\n\nAs we commenced operations on July 1, 2021, no expenses were incurred prior to July 1, 2021.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021: ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following: Table 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,568,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop </td> <td> </td> <td>16,067,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>172,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,990,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans or recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2021, one stop loans included $1,595,963 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had debt and equity investments in 29 portfolio companies. The following table shows the weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our DRIP in each case for the period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from July 1, 2021 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average income yield(1)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average investment income yield(2)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on average net asset value(3) *\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on net asset value per share(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n* Annualized for periods less than one year.\n(1)Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(2)Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(3)Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load.\n(4)Total return based on net asset value per share assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK, interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the\nform of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments or derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n\u2022reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $0.7 million;\n\u2022calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n\u2022fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\n\u2022expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n\u2022administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\n\u2022fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\n\u2022transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n\u2022U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022independent directors' fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n\u2022costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n\u2022costs associated with individual or group stockholders;\n\u2022costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n\u2022proxy voting expenses; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19, which was identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020, resulted in governmental authorities imposing restrictions on travel and the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, restaurants, healthcare facilities, fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions. While several countries, as well as certain states in the United States, have lifted or reduced certain travel restrictions, business closures and other quarantine measures and recurring COVID-19 outbreaks have led to the re-introduction of such restrictions in certain states in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions elsewhere. In early 2021, COVID-19 vaccines started to be administered to high-risk adults and essential workers across the United States and eligibility to receive the vaccine has since expanded to all adults in most states. Although we believe the number of vaccinated adults in the United States is promising for continued reductions of travel restrictions and other quarantine measures, we are unable to predict the duration of business and supply chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and GC Advisors continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and future recommendations from such authorities may further impact our business operations and financial results. Due to the resurgence of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants of COVID-19, we remain cautious and concerned about the on-going impacts to the U.S. economy from COVID-19.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 18, 2021, we notified stockholders of a capital call due on October 28, 2021.

The other material terms of the Adviser Revolver were unchanged.\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into an agreement with GC Advisors to waive any reimbursement by us for any operating expenses that GC Advisors or its affiliates incur on our behalf during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the period from July 1, 2021
