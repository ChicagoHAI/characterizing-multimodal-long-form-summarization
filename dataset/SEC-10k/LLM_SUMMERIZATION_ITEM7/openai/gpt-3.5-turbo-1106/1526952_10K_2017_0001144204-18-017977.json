Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nIncome. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other sources of income include fees from investment management services, earnings from customer service fees (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts), bank-owned life insurance, income from mortgage banking activities and gains on the sale of securities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management's best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based upon management's evaluation of the portfolio's collectibility. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged against income. Charge-offs, if any, are charged to the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans or pools of loans, but the entire allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nExpenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance, professional fees, advertising and marketing, and other general and administrative expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. We recognize annual employee compensation expenses stemming from our Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d) and our equity incentive plans. The actual amount of stock-related compensation and benefit expenses related to the ESOP is based on the fair market value of the shares of our common stock at specific points in time.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, rental expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years, or the expected lease terms, if shorter.\nData processing expense represents the fees associated with all business applications we pay to third parties for the use of their software for recording and managing deposit accounts, loan accounts, investment securities, general ledger, payroll and administrative functions within the organization. Included in this category are primary contracts with vendors, service providers and maintenance agreements in support of these functions.\nFederal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposit accounts.\nProfessional fees include consulting fees and expenses associated with being a public company which consist primarily of legal and accounting fees, expenses of stockholder communications and meetings, and stock exchange listing fees.\nAdvertising and marketing expense includes costs associated with design and delivery of promotional material through a variety of media related to products and services we make available to our customers.\nOther general and administrative expenses include office supplies, postage, insurance, board of directors and committee fees, and other miscellaneous operating expenses.\nBusiness Strategy and Objectives\nWellesley Bank provides comprehensive premier banking and wealth management services to successful people, families, businesses and non-profit organizations. With a legacy spanning over 100 years, we are committed to delivering exceptional service and trusted advice to our clients.\nAt Wellesley Bank, it is all about the people: our employees, our community and most importantly our clients. It's about hiring great people, developing them and treating them well, which in turn is a direct reflection on how we treat our clients. The foundation of our bank is built on integrity, community and exceptional client service, where everyone is treated fairly and with respect. We pride ourselves in having an entrepreneurial spirit, where we continue to evolve, stay open to ideas and make quick, sound decision. This is our strategy and our source of distinction.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary objective is to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas. We seek to achieve this by maintaining a strong capital position and high asset quality. Our operating objectives include the following:\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits and accessing a wider network of funding sources to maintain low funding costs. We seek to increase net interest income by controlling our funding costs. Over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost certificates of deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to seek demand deposits by growing commercial banking relationships. Core deposits (demand, NOW, money market and savings accounts) comprised 62.2% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017. While our focus and strategy will be to continue to emphasize core deposits and relationship banking, we have occasionally utilized our ability to grow certificates of deposit during times of greater loan demand as a means to support loan growth. We do this through our retail and brokered certificate offerings and we participate in a national market clearinghouse for placing competitively priced certificates of deposits with financial institutions, nonprofits and other corporate participants. National market certificates of deposit are sometimes less costly funds than local market retail certificates, and may provide access to a wider range of maturities than retail funds. In addition, we have expanded our use of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLB\u201d) to provide matched funding of commercial loans and short-term liquidity needs at relatively lower cost than retail deposits. Balances of FHLB advances have increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2016 to $115.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nIncreasing our deposit market share within our primary markets in eastern Massachusetts. Since its inception in 1911, Wellesley Bank has primarily served the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts and the immediate surrounding communities. Despite considerable competition from larger financial, we have made significant progress in recent years to increase our market presence in the town of Wellesley and in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Our deposits have increased $93.9 million, or 18.0%, from $522.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $616.7 million at December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2017 (the latest data available), we had 13.7% of the deposits in the town of Wellesley, which represented the third largest market share out of 16 financial institutions with branches in the town of Wellesley. Our market position is fortified by three full-service offices in Wellesley. We believe Wellesley and the surrounding market area will continue to provide opportunities for growth. We expanded our market presence into Boston through a full-service office that opened in November 2013 and opened a new full service banking office in Newton Centre in the spring of 2016.\nContinuing to develop our commercial real estate lending, commercial business lending, and construction lending, as well as increasing our commercial business depository relationships in our market area. We have worked to increase our commercial relationships by developing our premier bankers and diversifying our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans and offering business deposit and checking products. Since December 31, 2016, our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loan portfolio increased $45.9 million, or 16.3%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.2% of our total loan portfolio. In connection with the increase in our commercial business loan portfolio, we also have focused on providing a full banking relationship and, as a result, experienced an increase in our business deposit and checking accounts. Our business checking accounts increased $496 thousand, or 0.5% during 2017 and $26.5 million, or 41.3% during 2016, and represented 14.8% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we continue to expand and develop our cash management products, and on-line and mobile banking solutions to better serve our commercial customers.\nIncreasing our residential mortgage lending in our market area. We believe there are opportunities to increase residential mortgage lending in our market areas. The town of Wellesley and its surrounding communities have a sound economy and were not as negatively impacted by the 2008-2009 recession as other regions of the United States. As a result, the demand for residential mortgage loans in our market area, in particular larger jumbo\u201d loans, has not been as impacted by that downturn in the economy. Since December 31, 2016, our residential loans increased $61.0 million, or 22.7%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.5% of our total loan portfolio. In addition to our traditional markets in the town of Wellesley and surrounding communities, our lending territory currently includes sections of Boston in Suffolk County and Cambridge in Middlesex County which we believe provides additional lending opportunities and further diversifies our residential loan portfolio.\nContinuing conservative underwriting practices while maintaining a high quality loan portfolio. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and manageable credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and through diligent monitoring and collection efforts. Nonperforming loans decreased from $591 thousand at December 31, 2016 to $576 thousand at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were 0.08% of the total loan portfolio and 0.07% of total assets. The slight decrease in nonperforming loans was the result of payments received on a commercial loan relationship during 2017. We intend to increase our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business lending, while continuing our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through conservative loan underwriting and sound credit administration standards.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeeking to enhance fee income by growing investment advisory services. Our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. In order to decrease our reliance on net interest income, we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income. In particular, we offer a full array of investment advisory services for individuals, nonprofits, institutions, and endowments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellesley Investment Partners, LLC, a registered investment advisor. Investment management fees relating to our investment advisory services totaled $1.3 million, $982 thousand and $516 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We appointed a new president of Wellesley Investment Partners in the fourth quarter of 2014 and have augmented our business development efforts and research and support functions with a number of key individuals as we intend to grow and develop this aspect of our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are the following factors: the likelihood of default; the loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; the value of collateral; and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the current evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document.\nDeferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Management reviews deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to identify any uncertainties pertaining to realization of such assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets, management assesses historical and forecasted operating results, including a review of eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, the recent enactment of TCJA, the law that reduces our federal tax rate from 34.0% to 21.0% in 2018 caused us to re-value our deferred tax asset. The change in the tax rates means we will not be able to realize part of our deferred tax assets in the future and a one-time adjustment of $979 thousand was made in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nGeneral. Total assets increased $110.1 million, or 15.8%, from $695.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $805.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total assets increased primarily due to an increase in net loans of $110.2 million, or 19.1%. Securities available for sale increased $1.8 million to $66.4 million, primarily due to purchases of local municipal and Massachusetts bonds.\nLoans. Net loans increased $110.2 million, or 19.1%, from $576.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $686.3 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans was due primarily to an increase of $61.0 million, or 22.7%, in residential real estate loans. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans increased $48.1 million, or 19.3%, to $297.6 million while fixed-rate residential loans increased $12.9 million to $31.4 million. We continue to sell conforming longer-term fixed-rate residential loans that we have originated, while retaining adjustable-rate mortgages in portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, residential mortgage loans originated and sold to investors totaled $11.7 million and $30.7 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans increased $17.7 million, or 14.6%, during 2017 to $138.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in commercial real estate loans reflects our continued emphasis on originating these types of loans and increased loan demand. Construction loans increased $9.6 million, or 8.7%, to $120.0 million. Permanent construction loans, or those loans financing construction of owner-occupied residential properties, totaled $28.7 million at December 31, 2017, while speculative construction loans on residential properties, representing loans to builders, totaled $83.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in construction loan balances generally was due to strong demand for new home construction within our primary markets.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following

The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2017 regarding scheduled contractual maturities.

The funds received from the sale have been used for general corporate purposes including the down-streaming of substantially all of the funds to the Bank in the form of additional paid-in capital, which will support the continued growth objectives of the Bank.\nThe following table sets forth selected information regarding borrowings for the periods indicated.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At or For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Short-term Borrowings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average balance during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maximum outstanding at any month end during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.53 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term Debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average balance during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maximum outstanding at any month end during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subordinated Debt: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,734 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average balance during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maximum outstanding at any month end during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,734 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate at end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average interest rate during the year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOverview. Net income was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $249 thousand, or 8.5%. As a result of the TCJA, the Company was required to re-value the net deferred tax asset, which resulted in $979 thousand additional tax expense in the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the impact of TCJA, net income in the fourth quarter would have been $1.2 million, up 63.4% and for the year would have been $4.2 million, up 41.8% compared to 2016 (1). The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in tax expense, the provision for loan losses and increased noninterest expenses.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $22.7 million compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.8 million, or 13.9%. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to greater interest and dividend income, which increased by $3.6 million to $28.4 million for 2017 from $24.8 million for 2016. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased 14.5%, with an average rate earned on these assets of 3.95% for both years. Interest income from loans and loans held for sale increased $3.3 million, or 14.5%, due to an 16.3% increase in the average balance of loans and loans held for sale, partially offset by a decrease of seven basis points in the average rate earned on loans and loans held for sale. Most of the remaining increase was from higher balances in short-term investments combined with the rise in short-term interest rates.\nInterest expense increased $789 thousand, or 16.1%, during this period primarily due to an increase of $67.9 million, or 13.6%, in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average rates paid on deposits increased by three basis points in 2017 primarily due to a shift in the mix of deposits to higher cost term certificates and money market accounts. We experienced an increase in the average balance of money market accounts of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, while the average balance of savings accounts decreased 3.6% during that period. Rates paid on money market accounts increased six basis points during the period while rates paid on term certificates increased two basis points. Balances in lower cost NOW checking accounts and interest free checking accounts also increased during 2017.\nDuring 2017, we expanded our use of FHLB short-term borrowings which carried an average rate of 1.24% in 2017, compared to 0.58% in 2016, providing cost effective funding for a portion of our construction loan portfolio and supporting liquidity needs. As a result interest expense on short-term borrowings increased $193 thousand. Overall interest cost on long-term FHLB advances increased $129 thousand, or 12.3% as compared to the prior year. Average balances of long-term FHLB advances increased $13.1 million to $89.3 million at December 31, 2017, while the rate paid on FHLB advances decreased six basis points to 1.32% in 2017.\nThe interest expense on the subordinated debt issued in December 2017 was $632 thousand compared to $635 thousand for the same period in 2016. The average cost decreased four basis points to 6.47% in 2017.\n(1) Reconciliation of Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhile net income is a financial measure that is recorded in accordance with U.S. general accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), adjusted net income\u201d is not. Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications to give investors a better understanding of the effect of this one-time, $979 thousand, write-down of the Company's net deferred-tax assets caused by the enactment of TCJA on December 22, 2017.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of our net income (GAAP) and our adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TCJA additional tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted net income (Non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. Yields are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $735 thousand provision to the allowance for loan losses as compared to a provision of $437 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 provision reflects stronger growth in our loan portfolio, a slight change in our mix of loans, and a strong regional economy along with a well performing loan portfolio.\nFrom December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans decreased from $591 thousand to $576 thousand and are included in special mention, substandard, and doubtful assets, which totaled $5.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2016. Commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans, which bear higher risk and generally larger loss reserves than our residential mortgage loans, remain a significant portion of our loan portfolio at 47.2% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 48.3% of total loans at December 31, 2016.\nAn analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses is presented under -Risk Management-Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $277 thousand to $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For 2017, wealth management fees totaled $1.3 million, an increase of $275 thousand, or 28.0%, from 2016, resulting from the growth in assets under management within our wealth management subsidiary. In 2017, we recorded income from mortgage banking activities of $111 thousand compared to 2016 when income from mortgage banking activities totaled $288 thousand. The volume of loans originated for sale in 2017 totaled $11.7 million as compared to $30.7 million for 2016. The remaining components of non-interest income increased $179 thousand due to increases in fees on customer interest rate swaps and ATM network interchange fees.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $777 thousand to $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In general, the increase in expenses represents investment in the organization for continued, profitable growth. Salaries and employee benefits increased $403 thousand and totaled $10.1 million, compared to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Impacting salaries and benefits expense was the recognition of a full year of expenses related to our Newton Centre office, several strategic hires in late 2016, and employee merit increases. FDIC insurance costs increased $205 thousand, or 50.7%, due to new quarterly assessment rates and higher assessment balances. Data processing expense was higher by $114 thousand from the prior year due to increasing business volume. Advertising expense increased by $46 thousand, largely associated with our efforts to generate deposits. Occupancy and equipment expense remained flat at $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense increased $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 52.8% compared with 38.5% for 2016. The increase in taxes was a result of an additional tax provision of $979 thousand to re-value our net deferred tax asset in compliance with TCJA and higher net income before taxes.\nRisk Management\nOverview. Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk and liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or security when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are recorded at fair value. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers when due. Other risks that we face are operational risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, cyber security, regulatory compliance, processing errors, and technology and disaster recovery. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base and revenue.\nCredit Risk Management. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. This strategy also emphasizes conservative loan-to-value ratios and guarantees of construction and commercial real estate loans by parties with substantial net worth. In addition, annually, we engage an outside loan review firm to perform a thorough review of our commercial portfolio. This review involves analyzing all large borrowing relationships, delinquency trends and loan collateral valuation in order to identify impaired loans. We do not originate interest only\u201d mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal such as option ARM\u201d loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan. Additionally, we generally do not offer subprime loans\u201d (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments or bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity) or Alt-A\u201d loans (loans to borrowers having less than full documentation).\nWhen a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, management takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. Management makes initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes 15 days past due. If payment is not received by the 30th day of delinquency, efforts to contact the borrower are increased, and a plan of collection is pursued for each individual loan. A particular plan of collection may lead to foreclosure, the timing of which depends on the prospects for the borrower bringing the loan current, the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors, and the type and value of the collateral securing the loan and other factors. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances, as well as the sale of the nonperforming loans.\nManagement informs the board of directors on a monthly basis of the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days. Management also provides detailed reporting of loans greater than 90 days delinquent, all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own.\nAnalysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets. We consider foreclosed assets, loans that are maintained on a nonaccrual basis and loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they are classified as impaired or when they become 90 days or more past due. Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest ceases and interest income previously accrued on such loans is reversed against current period interest income. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance when collectibility of principal is in doubt.\nReal estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of its cost or fair market value at the date of foreclosure. Any holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTroubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower's financial difficulties. These concessions may include, but are not limited to, modifications of the terms of the debt, the transfer of assets or the issuance of an equity interest by the borrower to satisfy all or part of the debt, or the substitution or addition of borrower(s). We will not return a TDR to accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make principal and interest payments under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets, including TDRs, at the dates indicated. We did not have any accruing loans past due 90 days or more at the dates presented.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in

In addition, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets\u201d must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets\u201d have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high probability of loss. An asset classified as \u2018loss\u201d is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When management classifies an asset as substandard or doubtful, a specific allowance for loan losses may be established. If management classifies an asset as loss, an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The regulations also provide for a special mention\u201d category, described as assets that do not currently expose the Bank to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving the Bank's close attention. The Bank also utilizes an eleven grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans to assist in evaluating individual loans and determining assets classifications. See note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the aggregate amounts of our criticized and classified assets at the dates indicated.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special mention assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Substandard assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Doubtful assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, none of the special mention loans were in nonaccrual status. The decrease in special mention assets in 2017 was primarily the result of a borrower's loans being paid off. Substandard assets increased at December 31, 2017 as one commercial loan relationship was downgraded from special mention. Total substandard assets consisted of two accruing commercial loan relationships. Substandard loans in 2016 and 2015 consisted solely of nonaccrual loans. All doubtful assets in the table above are in nonaccrual status. In 2017, loans classified as doubtful decreased as one borrower made principal reduction payments.\nOther than as disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.\nDelinquencies.

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.\nOur methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of the following: (1) an allocated component related to impaired loans; (2) a general component related to the remainder of the loan portfolio; and (3) an unallocated component related to overall uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the entire portfolio.\nAllowance on Impaired Loans. The allocated component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired. The allowance for each impaired loan is determined by either the present value of expected future cash flows or, if the loan is collateral dependent, by the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. We identify a loan as impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management evaluates loans other than smaller-balance homogeneous loans for impairment. If a loan is determined to be impaired, an individual loss assessment is performed to determine the likelihood of a loss and, if applicable, the estimated measurement of the loss. Smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as performing residential real estate loans and consumer loans, are generally excluded from an individual impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated by management to estimate losses inherent in those loans. However, certain smaller-balance homogeneous loans will be individually evaluated for impairment when they reach nonperforming status or become subject to a restructuring agreement.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. The general component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are not impaired. Management determines the appropriate loss factor for each group of loans with similar risk characteristics within the portfolio based on loss experience and qualitative and environmental factors for loans in each group. Loan categories may include types of loans categorized by product, large credit exposures, concentrations, loan grade, or any other characteristic that causes a loan's risk profile to be similar to another. We consider qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience including changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; changes in experience, ability and depth of loan management; changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans and adversely graded or classified loans; changes in the quality of the loan review; changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; the existence of or changes in concentrations of credit; changes in economic or business conditions; and the effect of competition, and legal or regulatory requirements on estimated credit losses. Our qualitative and environmental factors are reviewed on a quarterly basis as is our historical loss experience to ensure they are reflective of current conditions in our loan portfolio and economy.\nUnallocated Allowance. Management maintains an unallocated component within the allowance for loan losses to cover uncertainties that could affect our overall estimate of probable losses. This component recognizes the imprecision inherent in the assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating the allocated and general components of the allowance, and is generally not a significant component of the overall allowance.\nWe identify loans that may need to be charged-off as a loss by reviewing all impaired loans and related loss analyses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of the loan balance is confirmed. A borrower's inability to make payments under the terms of the loan and a shortfall in collateral value would generally result in our charging off the loan to the extent of the loss deemed to be confirmed.\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31,

allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management's best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, there can be no assurance that the FDIC or the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nAnalysis of Loan Loss Experience.

We manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes originating adjustable-rate loans for retention in our loan portfolio, selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, promoting core deposit products and short-term time deposits, adjusting the maturities of borrowings and adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration. We currently do not participate in balance sheet hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments.\nWe have an Asset/Liability Committee, which includes members of management, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects of asset-liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.\nInterest Rate Risk Analysis. We analyze our interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income and equity simulations. The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive.\u201d An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the present value of our equity. Interest income and equity simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the Asset/Liability Committee and the board of directors. The simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and the present value of our equity under a range of assumptions. The numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee on a yearly basis. Changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates. The simulation analysis incorporates management's current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors.\nSimulation analysis is only an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. We continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities.\nThe table below sets forth an approximation of our exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next 12 month period using interest income and equity simulations. The simulations use projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the simulations. Because of the large percentage of loans we hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that, in turn, affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and would increase if prepayments accelerated. While we believe such assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage-backed security and loan repayment activity.\nThe following table reflects changes in estimated net interest income for the Bank at December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2018, assuming a static balance sheet. These estimates are in compliance with our internal policy limits.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basis Point ( bp\u201d) Change in Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,303 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.30 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(805 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.27 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(426 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.73 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reflects changes in the present value of equity for the Bank at December 31, 2017.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Present Value of Equity </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basis Point ( bp\u201d) Change in Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,715 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.34 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,780 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.60 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.73 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.\nManagement regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and securities available for sale. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents, which include short-term investments, totaled $28.5 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, whose aggregate fair value exceeds cost, provide additional sources of liquidity and had a fair value of $66.5 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had the ability to borrow approximately $56.4 million in additional funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. On December 31, 2017, we had $77.2 million of long-term debt outstanding, and $38.0 million of short-term borrowings outstanding, all of which were Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had the ability to borrow $5.0 million from the Co-operative Central Bank on an unsecured basis, and $8.9 million from the Federal Reserve Bank under a collateralized borrowing program, none of which was outstanding at that date. The Company also has a $5.0 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. No additional advances were outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $125.8 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $117.5 million in available lines of credit for individuals and corporate customers and unadvanced funds on construction loans. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2017 totaled $175.2 million, or 75.1% of total certificates of deposit. The large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers' hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods. If these maturing deposits are not renewed, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit. Management believes, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will be renewed. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nIn addition, we believe that our branch network, which is presently comprised of three full-service retail banking offices located in our Wellesley market area, our banking office in Boston, a full-service banking office in Newton that opened in spring 2016, and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities, will afford us sufficient long-term liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company contracts with numerous vendors to provide a wide range of services for the organization. Many of these contracts exceed one year in length. The cost of these contracts is generally recorded as period expenses and presented in appropriate line items in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 - Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over One\nto Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over\nThree to\nFive Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over\nFive Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subordinated debt obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing and Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. Primary financing activities consist of transactions in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us, local competitors, and other factors. Management generally manages the pricing of deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit and customer relationships. Occasionally, management offers promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits.\nIn addition, on December 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with certain institutional accredited investors (the Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2025 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued by the Company to the Purchasers at a price equal to 100% of their face amount. The net proceeds from the Notes offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including for the provision of additional liquidity and working capital.\nThe Notes have a stated maturity of December 30, 2025, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00% per year, from and including December 17, 2015 to but excluding December 30, 2020, computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including December 30, 2020 to, but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per year equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 435.5 basis points, computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed, payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after December 30, 2020 and at any time upon the occurrences of certain events.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents our primary investing and financing activities during the periods indicated.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan originations, net of principal payments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(110,336 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68,738 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from calls, maturities and principal repayments of securities available for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchases of securities available for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,072 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,926 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase in deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,072 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase in short-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Decrease) increase in long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,160 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Management. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2017, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements. We are considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines. See Regulation and Supervision-Federal Regulations-Capital Requirements\u201d and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe capital from our 2012 conversion significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity has been reduced as net proceeds from the stock conversion were used for general corporate purposes, including initially, the payment of operating expenses and the funding of lending activities. We may elect to use capital management tools such as cash dividends and common share repurchases to enhance stockholder value.\nThe Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.19 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. There can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will declare any future cash dividends.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The MD&A report discusses the financial performance and operations of the company, emphasizing its primary source of income as net interest income.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nIncome. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other sources of income include fees from investment management services, earnings from customer service fees (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts), bank-owned life insurance, income from mortgage banking activities and gains on the sale of securities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management's best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based upon management's evaluation of the portfolio's collectibility. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged against income. Charge-offs, if any, are charged to the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans or pools of loans, but the entire allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nExpenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance, professional fees, advertising and marketing, and other general and administrative expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. We recognize annual employee compensation expenses stemming from our Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d) and our equity incentive plans. The actual amount of stock-related compensation and benefit expenses related to the ESOP is based on the fair market value of the shares of our common stock at specific points in time.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, rental expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years, or the expected lease terms, if shorter.\nData processing expense represents the fees associated with all business applications we pay to third parties for the use of their software for recording and managing deposit accounts, loan accounts, investment securities, general ledger, payroll and administrative functions within the organization. Included in this category are primary contracts with vendors, service providers and maintenance agreements in support of these functions.\nFederal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposit accounts.\nProfessional fees include consulting fees and expenses associated with being a public company which consist primarily of legal and accounting fees, expenses of stockholder communications and meetings, and stock exchange listing fees.\nAdvertising and marketing expense includes costs associated with design and delivery of promotional material through a variety of media related to products and services we make available to our customers.\nOther general and administrative expenses include office supplies, postage, insurance, board of directors and committee fees, and other miscellaneous operating expenses.\nBusiness Strategy and Objectives\nWellesley Bank provides comprehensive premier banking and wealth management services to successful people, families, businesses and non-profit organizations. With a legacy spanning over 100 years, we are committed to delivering exceptional service and trusted advice to our clients.\nAt Wellesley Bank, it is all about the people: our employees, our community and most importantly our clients. It's about hiring great people, developing them and treating them well, which in turn is a direct reflection on how we treat our clients. The foundation of our bank is built on integrity, community and exceptional client service, where everyone is treated fairly and with respect. We pride ourselves in having an entrepreneurial spirit, where we continue to evolve, stay open to ideas and make quick, sound decision. This is our strategy and our source of distinction.\n 26 \nOur primary objective is to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas. We seek to achieve this by maintaining a strong capital position and high asset quality. Our operating objectives include the following:\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits and accessing a wider network of funding sources to maintain low funding costs. We seek to increase net interest income by controlling our funding costs. Over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost certificates of deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to seek demand deposits by growing commercial banking relationships. Core deposits (demand, NOW, money market and savings accounts) comprised 62.2% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017. While our focus and strategy will be to continue to emphasize core deposits and relationship banking, we have occasionally utilized our ability to grow certificates of deposit during times of greater loan demand as a means to support loan growth. We do this through our retail and brokered certificate offerings and we participate in a national market clearinghouse for placing competitively priced certificates of deposits with financial institutions, nonprofits and other corporate participants. National market certificates of deposit are sometimes less costly funds than local market retail certificates, and may provide access to a wider range of maturities than retail funds. In addition, we have expanded our use of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLB\u201d) to provide matched funding of commercial loans and short-term liquidity needs at relatively lower cost than retail deposits. Balances of FHLB advances have increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2016 to $115.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nIncreasing our deposit market share within our primary markets in eastern Massachusetts. Since its inception in 1911, Wellesley Bank has primarily served the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts and the immediate surrounding communities. Despite considerable competition from larger financial, we have made significant progress in recent years to increase our market presence in the town of Wellesley and in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Our deposits have increased $93.9 million, or 18.0%, from $522.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $616.7 million at December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2017 (the latest data available), we had 13.7% of the deposits in the town of Wellesley, which represented the third largest market share out of 16 financial institutions with branches in the town of Wellesley. Our market position is fortified by three full-service offices in Wellesley. We believe Wellesley and the surrounding market area will continue to provide opportunities for growth. We expanded our market presence into Boston through a full-service office that opened in November 2013 and opened a new full service banking office in Newton Centre in the spring of 2016.\nContinuing to develop our commercial real estate lending, commercial business lending, and construction lending, as well as increasing our commercial business depository relationships in our market area. We have worked to increase our commercial relationships by developing our premier bankers and diversifying our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans and offering business deposit and checking products. Since December 31, 2016, our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loan portfolio increased $45.9 million, or 16.3%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.2% of our total loan portfolio. In connection with the increase in our commercial business loan portfolio, we also have focused on providing a full banking relationship and, as a result, experienced an increase in our business deposit and checking accounts. Our business checking accounts increased $496 thousand, or 0.5% during 2017 and $26.5 million, or 41.3% during 2016, and represented 14.8% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we continue to expand and develop our cash management products, and on-line and mobile banking solutions to better serve our commercial customers.\nIncreasing our residential mortgage lending in our market area. We believe there are opportunities to increase residential mortgage lending in our market areas. The town of Wellesley and its surrounding communities have a sound economy and were not as negatively impacted by the 2008-2009 recession as other regions of the United States. As a result, the demand for residential mortgage loans in our market area, in particular larger jumbo\u201d loans, has not been as impacted by that downturn in the economy. Since December 31, 2016, our residential loans increased $61.0 million, or 22.7%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.5% of our total loan portfolio. In addition to our traditional markets in the town of Wellesley and surrounding communities, our lending territory currently includes sections of Boston in Suffolk County and Cambridge in Middlesex County which we believe provides additional lending opportunities and further diversifies our residential loan portfolio.\nContinuing conservative underwriting practices while maintaining a high quality loan portfolio. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and manageable credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and through diligent monitoring and collection efforts. Nonperforming loans decreased from $591 thousand at December 31, 2016 to $576 thousand at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were 0.08% of the total loan portfolio and 0.07% of total assets. The slight decrease in nonperforming loans was the result of payments received on a commercial loan relationship during 2017. We intend to increase our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business lending, while continuing our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through conservative loan underwriting and sound credit administration standards.\n 27 \nSeeking to enhance fee income by growing investment advisory services. Our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. In order to decrease our reliance on net interest income, we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income. In particular, we offer a full array of investment advisory services for individuals, nonprofits, institutions, and endowments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellesley Investment Partners, LLC, a registered investment advisor. Investment management fees relating to our investment advisory services totaled $1.3 million, $982 thousand and $516 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We appointed a new president of Wellesley Investment Partners in the fourth quarter of 2014 and have augmented our business development efforts and research and support functions with a number of key individuals as we intend to grow and develop this aspect of our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are the following factors: the likelihood of default; the loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; the value of collateral; and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the current evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document.\nDeferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Management reviews deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to identify any uncertainties pertaining to realization of such assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets, management assesses historical and forecasted operating results, including a review of eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, the recent enactment of TCJA, the law that reduces our federal tax rate from 34.0% to 21.0% in 2018 caused us to re-value our deferred tax asset. The change in the tax rates means we will not be able to realize part of our deferred tax assets in the future and a one-time adjustment of $979 thousand was made in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nGeneral. Total assets increased $110.1 million, or 15.8%, from $695.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $805.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total assets increased primarily due to an increase in net loans of $110.2 million, or 19.1%. Securities available for sale increased $1.8 million to $66.4 million, primarily due to purchases of local municipal and Massachusetts bonds.\nLoans. Net loans increased $110.2 million, or 19.1%, from $576.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $686.3 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans was due primarily to an increase of $61.0 million, or 22.7%, in residential real estate loans. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans increased $48.1 million, or 19.3%, to $297.6 million while fixed-rate residential loans increased $12.9 million to $31.4 million. We continue to sell conforming longer-term fixed-rate residential loans that we have originated, while retaining adjustable-rate mortgages in portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, residential mortgage loans originated and sold to investors totaled $11.7 million and $30.7 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans increased $17.7 million, or 14.6%, during 2017 to $138.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in commercial real estate loans reflects our continued emphasis on originating these types of loans and increased loan demand. Construction loans increased $9.6 million, or 8.7%, to $120.0 million. Permanent construction loans, or those loans financing construction of owner-occupied residential properties, totaled $28.7 million at December 31, 2017, while speculative construction loans on residential properties, representing loans to builders, totaled $83.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in construction loan balances generally was due to strong demand for new home construction within our primary markets.\n 28 \nThe following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, at the dates indicated.\n\n\nLoan Maturity. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2017 regarding scheduled contractual maturities. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which could significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The amounts shown below exclude net deferred loan costs and fees.\n\n 29 \nFixed vs. Adjustable Rate Loans. The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all scheduled maturities of loans at December 31, 2017 that are due after December 31, 2018 and have either fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. The amounts shown below exclude net deferred loan costs and fees.\n\nSecurities. Our securities portfolio consists primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds, SBA and other asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. Securities available for sale increased by $1.8 million, or 2.8%, to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the purchases of local municipal and Massachusetts bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities, and government-sponsored enterprise obligations. The increase in securities available for sale reflects our desire to maintain appropriate levels of high quality liquid investments with terms and characteristics that complement our lending activities.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair values of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nIncome. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other sources of income include fees from investment management services, earnings from customer service fees (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts), bank-owned life insurance, income from mortgage banking activities and gains on the sale of securities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management's best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based upon management's evaluation of the portfolio's collectibility. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged against income. Charge-offs, if any, are charged to the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans or pools of loans, but the entire allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nExpenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance, professional fees, advertising and marketing, and other general and administrative expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. We recognize annual employee compensation expenses stemming from our Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP\u201d) and our equity incentive plans. The actual amount of stock-related compensation and benefit expenses related to the ESOP is based on the fair market value of the shares of our common stock at specific points in time.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, rental expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years, or the expected lease terms, if shorter.\nData processing expense represents the fees associated with all business applications we pay to third parties for the use of their software for recording and managing deposit accounts, loan accounts, investment securities, general ledger, payroll and administrative functions within the organization. Included in this category are primary contracts with vendors, service providers and maintenance agreements in support of these functions.\nFederal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposit accounts.\nProfessional fees include consulting fees and expenses associated with being a public company which consist primarily of legal and accounting fees, expenses of stockholder communications and meetings, and stock exchange listing fees.\nAdvertising and marketing expense includes costs associated with design and delivery of promotional material through a variety of media related to products and services we make available to our customers.\nOther general and administrative expenses include office supplies, postage, insurance, board of directors and committee fees, and other miscellaneous operating expenses.\nBusiness Strategy and Objectives\nWellesley Bank provides comprehensive premier banking and wealth management services to successful people, families, businesses and non-profit organizations. With a legacy spanning over 100 years, we are committed to delivering exceptional service and trusted advice to our clients.\nAt Wellesley Bank, it is all about the people: our employees, our community and most importantly our clients. It's about hiring great people, developing them and treating them well, which in turn is a direct reflection on how we treat our clients. The foundation of our bank is built on integrity, community and exceptional client service, where everyone is treated fairly and with respect. We pride ourselves in having an entrepreneurial spirit, where we continue to evolve, stay open to ideas and make quick, sound decision. This is our strategy and our source of distinction.\n 26 \nOur primary objective is to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas. We seek to achieve this by maintaining a strong capital position and high asset quality. Our operating objectives include the following:\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits and accessing a wider network of funding sources to maintain low funding costs. We seek to increase net interest income by controlling our funding costs. Over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost certificates of deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to seek demand deposits by growing commercial banking relationships. Core deposits (demand, NOW, money market and savings accounts) comprised 62.2% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017. While our focus and strategy will be to continue to emphasize core deposits and relationship banking, we have occasionally utilized our ability to grow certificates of deposit during times of greater loan demand as a means to support loan growth. We do this through our retail and brokered certificate offerings and we participate in a national market clearinghouse for placing competitively priced certificates of deposits with financial institutions, nonprofits and other corporate participants. National market certificates of deposit are sometimes less costly funds than local market retail certificates, and may provide access to a wider range of maturities than retail funds. In addition, we have expanded our use of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLB\u201d) to provide matched funding of commercial loans and short-term liquidity needs at relatively lower cost than retail deposits. Balances of FHLB advances have increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2016 to $115.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nIncreasing our deposit market share within our primary markets in eastern Massachusetts. Since its inception in 1911, Wellesley Bank has primarily served the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts and the immediate surrounding communities. Despite considerable competition from larger financial, we have made significant progress in recent years to increase our market presence in the town of Wellesley and in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Our deposits have increased $93.9 million, or 18.0%, from $522.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $616.7 million at December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2017 (the latest data available), we had 13.7% of the deposits in the town of Wellesley, which represented the third largest market share out of 16 financial institutions with branches in the town of Wellesley. Our market position is fortified by three full-service offices in Wellesley. We believe Wellesley and the surrounding market area will continue to provide opportunities for growth. We expanded our market presence into Boston through a full-service office that opened in November 2013 and opened a new full service banking office in Newton Centre in the spring of 2016.\nContinuing to develop our commercial real estate lending, commercial business lending, and construction lending, as well as increasing our commercial business depository relationships in our market area. We have worked to increase our commercial relationships by developing our premier bankers and diversifying our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans and offering business deposit and checking products. Since December 31, 2016, our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loan portfolio increased $45.9 million, or 16.3%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.2% of our total loan portfolio. In connection with the increase in our commercial business loan portfolio, we also have focused on providing a full banking relationship and, as a result, experienced an increase in our business deposit and checking accounts. Our business checking accounts increased $496 thousand, or 0.5% during 2017 and $26.5 million, or 41.3% during 2016, and represented 14.8% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we continue to expand and develop our cash management products, and on-line and mobile banking solutions to better serve our commercial customers.\nIncreasing our residential mortgage lending in our market area. We believe there are opportunities to increase residential mortgage lending in our market areas. The town of Wellesley and its surrounding communities have a sound economy and were not as negatively impacted by the 2008-2009 recession as other regions of the United States. As a result, the demand for residential mortgage loans in our market area, in particular larger jumbo\u201d loans, has not been as impacted by that downturn in the economy. Since December 31, 2016, our residential loans increased $61.0 million, or 22.7%, and at December 31, 2017 was 47.5% of our total loan portfolio. In addition to our traditional markets in the town of Wellesley and surrounding communities, our lending territory currently includes sections of Boston in Suffolk County and Cambridge in Middlesex County which we believe provides additional lending opportunities and further diversifies our residential loan portfolio.\nContinuing conservative underwriting practices while maintaining a high quality loan portfolio. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and manageable credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and through diligent monitoring and collection efforts. Nonperforming loans decreased from $591 thousand at December 31, 2016 to $576 thousand at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were 0.08% of the total loan portfolio and 0.07% of total assets. The slight decrease in nonperforming loans was the result of payments received on a commercial loan relationship during 2017. We intend to increase our commercial real estate, construction and commercial business lending, while continuing our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through conservative loan underwriting and sound credit administration standards.\n 27 \nSeeking to enhance fee income by growing investment advisory services. Our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. In order to decrease our reliance on net interest income, we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income. In particular, we offer a full array of investment advisory services for individuals, nonprofits, institutions, and endowments through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellesley Investment Partners, LLC, a registered investment advisor. Investment management fees relating to our investment advisory services totaled $1.3 million, $982 thousand and $516 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We appointed a new president of Wellesley Investment Partners in the fourth quarter of 2014 and have augmented our business development efforts and research and support functions with a number of key individuals as we intend to grow and develop this aspect of our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses.

Our securities portfolio consists primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds, SBA and other asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. Securities available for sale increased by $1.8 million, or 2.8%, to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the purchases of local municipal and Massachusetts bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities, and government-sponsored enterprise obligations. The increase in securities available for sale reflects our desire to maintain appropriate levels of high quality liquid investments with terms and characteristics that complement our lending activities.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair values of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential mortgage-backed securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government National Mortgage Association </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Government-sponsored enterprises </td> <td> </td> <td>"}
