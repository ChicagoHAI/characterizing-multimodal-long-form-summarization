Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the discussion includes forward-looking statements related to future events and our future operating performance that are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure-play IVD business driven by our credo, Because Every Test is A Life.\u201d This guiding principle reflects the crucial role diagnostics play in global health and guides our priorities as an organization. As a leader in IVD, we impact approximately 800,000 patients every day. We are dedicated to improving outcomes for these patients and saving lives through providing innovative and reliable diagnostic testing solutions to the clinical laboratory and transfusion medicine communities. Our global infrastructure and commercial reach allow us to serve these markets with significant scale. We have an intense focus on the customer. We support our customers with high quality diagnostic instrumentation, a broad test portfolio and market leading service. Our products deliver consistently fast, accurate and reliable results that allow clinicians to make better-informed treatment decisions. Our business model generates significant recurring revenues and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high margin consumables. These consumables contribute more than 90% of our total revenue. We maintain close connectivity with our customers through our global presence, with more than 4,500 employees, including approximately 2,200 commercial sales, service and marketing teammates. This global organization allows us to support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories.\nKey components of results of operations\nNet revenue\nWe operate on a razor/razor blade\u201d model whereby we offer our customers a selection of automated instruments under long-term contracts along with the assays, reagents and other consumables that are used by these instruments to generate test results. This business model allows us to generate predictable recurring revenue and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high-margin assays, reagents and other consumables and services, sales of which represented greater than 90% of our core revenue during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We also employ a closed system\u201d strategy with our instruments, which allows only our assays, reagents and other consumables to be used by our instruments and further strengthens the predictability of our revenue. Finally, our typical customer contract length is approximately five years and we have benefitted from a good customer retention rate in recent years.\nWe manage our business geographically to better align with the market dynamics of the specific geographic region with our reportable segments being Americas, EMEA and Greater China. We generate revenue primarily in the following lines of business:\nCore:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Clinical Laboratories-Focused on clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments and tests to detect and monitor disease progression across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, including grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Transfusion Medicine-Focused on (i) immunohematology instruments and tests used for blood typing to ensure patient-donor compatibility in blood transfusions and (ii) donor screening instruments and tests used for blood and plasma screening for infectious diseases for customers primarily in the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-core:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other Product Revenue-Our other product revenue includes revenues primarily from contract manufacturing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Collaboration and Other Revenue-We have entered into collaboration and license agreements pursuant to which we derive collaboration and royalty revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll non-core revenue is recorded in the Americas segment for all periods presented.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and gross profit\nThe primary components of our cost of revenue are purchased materials, the overhead costs related to our manufacturing operations and direct labor associated with the manufacture of our instruments, assays, reagents and other consumables and depreciation of customer leased instruments.\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses\nThe primary components of our selling, marketing and administrative expenses are employee-related costs in our sales, marketing and administrative and support functions, marketing costs, distribution costs and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs. Employee-related costs include compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions, employee recruiting and relocation expenses, employee training costs and travel-related costs.\nResearch and development expense\nThe primary components of our research and development expense are costs related to clinical trials and regulatory-related spending, as well as employee-related costs in these functions, and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets consists solely of the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Ortho from Johnson and Johnson by Carlyle.\nOther operating expense, net\nThe primary components of other operating expense, net, are profit share expense related to our Joint Business and restructuring charges.\nInterest expense, net\nThe primary components of interest expense, net are interest charges and amortization of deferred financing charges related to our borrowings.\nTax indemnification expense (income), net\nThe primary components of tax indemnification expense (income), net are gains and losses related to certain federal, state and foreign tax matters that relate to the period prior to the Acquisition and for which we have indemnification agreements. We are subject to income tax in approximately 34 jurisdictions outside the United States. Our most significant operations outside the United States are located in China, France, Japan and the United Kingdom. For these jurisdictions for which we have significant operations, the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction, with 2013 being the oldest tax year still open. We are currently under audit in certain jurisdictions for tax years under the responsibility of Johnson & Johnson. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, all tax liabilities related to these tax years will be indemnified by Johnson & Johnson.\nOther expense (income), net\nThe primary components of other expense (income), net are foreign currency related gains and losses, including unrealized gains and losses on intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries, and losses related to early extinguishment of certain borrowings.\nImpact of the initial public offering\nUse of proceeds and impact of debt extinguishment\nOn February 1, 2021, we completed the IPO of our ordinary shares at a price of $17.00 per share. We issued and sold 76,000,000 ordinary shares in the IPO, and issued and sold an additional 11,400,000 ordinary shares on February 4, 2021 pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from us, as previously disclosed in the IPO prospectus. The ordinary shares sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to (the IPO Registration Statement\u201d), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2021. Our ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol OCDX\u201d. The offering, including proceeds from the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, generated net proceeds to us of $1,426.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nWe used the net proceeds from the IPO (i) to redeem $160 million of our 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $11.8 million of redemption premium, (ii) to redeem $270 million of our 2028 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $19.6 million of redemption premium, (iii) to repay $892.7 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our Dollar Term Loan Facility and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIncremental public company expenses\nAs a new public company, we will incur significant expenses on an ongoing basis that we did not incur as a private company, including increased director and officer liability insurance expense, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal and investor and public relations expenses. These costs will generally be included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.\nStock-based compensation expense\nIn connection with our IPO, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we may incur a one-time stock-based compensation expense related to options held by certain members of management that may vest upon the completion of certain liquidity and realization events. Furthermore, we implemented a new long-term equity incentive plan during 2021 in connection with our IPO in order to align our equity compensation program with public company plans and practices.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2020, as the global COVID-19 pandemic began to affect certain countries, we began to see a decrease in the number of tests run in China in February, which spread to certain countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific ( ASPAC\u201d) in early March and resulted in a worldwide decrease in the number of tests run globally by the end of March. In many countries, we experienced a lag between the timing of the decrease in number of tests run and the decrease in shipments of additional products to our customers. The decrease in shipments to our customers began to occur during the fiscal second quarter ended June 28, 2020 in many countries, including the United States. During the fiscal third quarter ended September 27, 2020 and the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 3, 2021, we did experience some recovery in the base business of our core revenue, further supplemented with sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests, mainly in the North America region. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced decreased revenues, incurred idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight and higher distribution costs compared to the prior year for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We believe that the decrease in the number of tests run by medical institutions is a result of government-imposed lockdown or stay at home orders and delays in elective medical procedures and we expect this will continue to negatively impact our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA during the remainder of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that once these government measures are lifted or relaxed, demand will begin to slowly return.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we mobilized our research and development teams in order to bring to market COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We have received a combination of Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, authority to affix a CE Mark for sale in the European Union and various other regulatory approvals globally for our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We continue to work on gaining further regulatory approvals to sell the tests in other markets worldwide. Our COVID-19 antibody tests detect whether a patient has been previously infected by COVID-19 and our COVID-19 antigen test detects whether a patient is currently infected by COVID-19. All three of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests run on our existing instruments.\nWe are continually monitoring our business continuity plans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the fact that our products and services are considered to be medically critical, our manufacturing and research and development sites are generally exempt from governmental orders in the United States and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. For these sites, we have taken steps to protect our employees, and the majority of our office-based work is being conducted remotely. We have also implemented strict travel restrictions, which has reduced our travel-related operating expenses.\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing matter, our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nResults of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nFiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended December 29, 2019\nOverview of results\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, reported net loss of $211.9 million increased by $55.0 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Our results were materially impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, as net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations. We also incurred higher idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight costs and higher distribution costs, which were partially offset by cost containment measures to incur lower employee-related costs and lower travel-related costs. Our results were also affected by a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million, higher foreign currency losses, primarily unrealized, and losses on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million, or 2.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations, which was primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against a variety of currencies. The decrease in net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currency\nexchange, was mainly driven by lower revenues in our Clinical Laboratories business in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million, as well as lower revenues in our Transfusion Medicine business in all regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Clinical Laboratories business in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. The decrease in net revenue was also impacted by lower other product revenue due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nThe following table shows total net revenue by line of business:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical Laboratories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfusion Medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 580.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 598.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,734.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,740.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Product Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,766.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 increased by $11.9 million, or 1.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This increase included operational net revenue gains of 2.3% partially offset by a negative impact of 1.2% from foreign currency fluctuations. Clinical Laboratories revenue increased in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. These increases were offset by lower revenues in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to decreased shipments to customers as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $17.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 3.3% partially offset by a positive impact of 0.3% from foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments to customers in all regions as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-core revenue\nOther Product Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $28.8 million, or 77.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues related to our HCV/HIV license agreements, partially offset by $7.5 million of license revenue related to the Joint Business granting a customer a license to sell certain products in Canada.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of net\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of net\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 908.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 922.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 858.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to idle or underutilized facility costs of $14.8 million and freight costs of $6.9 million incurred as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, which were primarily related to depreciation related charges incurred in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 related to assets no longer in use due to the transfer of certain production lines.

The decrease in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation and severance expense, and decreased travel-related costs, partially offset by increased distribution costs and increased third-party costs.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense was $112.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, or 6.4% of net revenue, as compared with research and development expense of $98.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, or 5.4% of net revenue, an increase of $14.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million made to Quotient upon the signing of a binding letter agreement and costs incurred to perform research and development activities related to developing our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $131.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 as compared with $131.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no major changes in the composition of our intangible assets in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nOther operating expense, net\nOther operating expense, net, was $35.3 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, as compared with $48.8 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, a decrease of $13.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit share expense in the current year from lower revenue related to our Joint Business.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense was $198.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, compared with $231.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease of $33.2 million was primarily related to lower interest rates on the Dollar Term Loan Facility.\nTax indemnification expense, net\nTax indemnification expense was $31.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain U.S. federal and state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense. Tax indemnification expense was $29.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $84.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and primarily related to $69.5 million of foreign currency losses, of which $68.2 million was unrealized and loss on early extinguishment of the 2022 Notes of $12.6 million. The unrealized foreign currency losses are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nOther expense, net was $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and primarily related to $16.0 million of fair value losses on interest rate caps that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by $10.5 million of net foreign currency\ngains, of which $18.1 million was unrealized. The unrealized foreign currency gains are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nBenefit from income taxes\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $225.3 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $13.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) partially offset by an increase in certain post-Acquisition non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions, and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $180.8 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $23.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 13.3%. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance, (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition state and non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) an increase in our interest expense on prior year reserves for uncertain tax positions and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nFiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\nOverview of results\nReported net loss of $156.9 million decreased $91.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease in net loss during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to higher revenues, lower cost of revenue, primarily due to lower restructuring-related costs, lower debt refinancing costs and lower foreign exchange related losses. These items were partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative costs, primarily driven by increased stock-based compensation expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 increased by $14.2 million, or 0.8%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $29 million, primarily driven by changes in the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi, Euro, British Pound and Brazilian Real. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was driven primarily by increased revenues in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, the impact of which is included in our Clinical Laboratories business, as well as increased revenues in China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, primarily related to our Clinical Laboratories business. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues related to our Donor Screening business within Transfusion Medicine in Japan and other product and collaboration revenues, which are included in our U.S. results.\nThe following table shows net revenue by line of business:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical Laboratories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,102.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfusion Medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 598.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 616.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,740.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,718.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Product Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,787.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue increased $39.8 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $22 million, the increase in Clinical Laboratories revenue was primarily driven by reagent sales in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, and instrument sales in China. These increases were partially offset by lower instrument sales in North America.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue decreased $18.1 million, or 2.9%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $9 million, the decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily driven by decreased reagent sales in Japan in the Donor Screening business, partially offset by increased reagent sales in the Immunohematology business.\nNon-core revenue\nOther product revenue, related to our contract manufacturing business, increased $1.3 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 primarily due to the timing of completion of certain performance obligations.\nCollaboration and other revenue during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 decreased $8.8 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to lower revenues recorded related to our HCV/HIV license agreements.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 922.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 930.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 856.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cost of revenue and increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 was primarily due to $20.8 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. This was partially offset by higher revenues primarily due to an increase in volume of reagent sales in our core business in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.

As a percentage of net revenue, selling, marketing and administrative expenses was 28.6% for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 as compared with 27.5% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The increase in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense of $11.4 million and other employee-related costs, including the strategic investments in our sales force in key markets, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, partially offset by lower consulting-related expenses.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense was $98.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 as compared with $98.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.7%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense was 5.4% for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 as compared with 5.5% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease in research and development spending was primarily due to the timing of certain clinical trials and regulatory-related spending.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $131.7 million and $128.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in amortization of intangible assets was due to the reclassification of our in-process research and development intangible to developed technology and the commencement of amortization during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 upon receipt of CE Mark on the related instrument.\nOther operating expense, net\nOther operating expense, net, of $48.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 decreased by $22.4 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by $18.5 million of debt refinancing costs incurred during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 relating to the second amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities on June 8, 2018, as well as higher restructuring costs of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense was $231.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, compared with $235.6 million during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease of $4.2 million primarily resulted from lower amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts.\nTax indemnification (income) expense\nTax indemnification expense was $29.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and was primarily related to indemnification expense related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense. Tax indemnification income was $13.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 and was primarily related to interest on our indemnification receivables related to certain state tax matters included in our pre-Acquisition audit reserves.\nOther expense (income), net\nOther expense, net for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was $5.7 million and primarily related to $16.0 million of fair value losses on interest rate caps that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by $10.5 million of net foreign currency gains, of which $18.1 million was unrealized. The unrealized foreign currency gains are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nOther expense, net for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 was $61.6 million and primarily related to $53.0 million of net foreign currency losses, of which $43.3 million was unrealized and fair value losses of $2.7 million on interest rate caps that did not qualify for hedge accounting. The unrealized foreign currency losses are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a benefit from income taxes of $23.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, which represents a 13.3% effective tax rate in relation to the loss before provision for taxes of $180.8 million. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance, (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition state and non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) an increase in our interest expense on prior year reserves for uncertain tax positions and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of loss carryforwards (or other deferred tax assets) will not be realized in the future. In periods when entities subject to a valuation allowance generate pre-tax earnings or losses, the corresponding increase or decrease in the valuation allowance has an overall impact on the effective tax rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $31.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, which represents a negative 14.3% effective tax rate in relation to the loss before provision for taxes of $217.6 million. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance, (2) an increase in our reserves for uncertain tax positions, (3) an increase in our interest expense on prior year reserves for uncertain tax positions and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that our financial statements and the other financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with GAAP, and are consistent with current practice, with the exception of the inclusion of financial measures that differ from measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss before interest expense, net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes and depreciation and amortization and eliminates (i) non-operating income or expense and (ii) impacts of certain non-cash,\nunusual or other items that are included in net loss that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Management EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBITDA plus certain other management adjustments.\nWe use these financial measures in the analysis of our financial and operating performance because they assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. Additionally, Management EBITDA is the basis we use for assessing the profitability of our geographic-based reportable segments and is also utilized as a basis for calculating certain management incentive compensation programs. In the case of Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that making such adjustments provides management and investors meaningful information to understand our operating performance and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.\nOther companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, these financial measures have limitations as analytical and comparative tools and you should not consider these items in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in the presentation of these metrics included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> do not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2025 Notes and the 2028 Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> eliminate the impact of income taxes on our results of operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these financial measures only as a supplement to our GAAP results. In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of these metrics should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items or changes in our customer base. Additionally, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from that included in the Credit Agreement, the 2025 Notes Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture for purposes of covenant calculation.\nThe following tables reconcile Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Management EBITDA for the periods presented.\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td>

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2028 Notes, we entered into a $350 million U.S. dollar-equivalent swap to Japanese Yen-denominated interest at a weighted average rate of 5.56% with a five-year term. During June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we amended our Dollar Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. See -Debt capitalization\u201d for additional details.\nAs of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, we have no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled $37.5 million and $34.6 million as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. Our availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $312.5 million and $315.4 million as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. On February 5, 2021, we increased the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by $150.0 million to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we entered into the Financing Program with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Financing Program is secured by receivables from the Ortho U.S. business that are sold or contributed to a wholly-owned, consolidated, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The bankruptcy remote subsidiary's sole business consists of the purchase or receipt of the receivables and subsequent granting of a security interest to the financial institution under the program, and its assets are available first to satisfy obligations and are not available to pay creditors of our other legal entities. Under the Financing Program, we may borrow up to the lower of $75 million or 85% of the eligible accounts receivable borrowing base. At January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the eligible accounts receivable borrowing base was $81.4 million and $90.7 million, respectively. Interest on outstanding borrowing under the Financing Program is charged based on a per annum rate equal to LIBOR Rate (with a floor of zero percent and as defined in the agreement) plus the LIBOR Rate Margin (2.25 percentage points) if the related loan is a LIBOR Rate Loan. Otherwise, the per annum rate is equal to a Base Rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the Base Rate Margin (1.25 percentage points). Interest is due and payable, in arrears, on the first day of each month. The Financing Program is also subject to termination under standard events of default as defined. Costs related to the Financing Program of $1.0 million were recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the borrowings and are amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the Financing Program. As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the remaining unamortized balance was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. On January 24, 2019, we extended the maturity of our Financing Program from September 23, 2019 to January 24, 2022. In addition, we amended our Financing Program terms to increase availability under the terms of the program within the existing $75 million limit of the agreement.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we entered into a sale-leaseback financing arrangement with a third-party financing company (the Buyer-lessor\u201d) related to specific property and equipment of the Company. The property and equipment were sold for $36.3 million and leased\nback over an initial term of two years. The monthly lease payments are $1.5 million until the equipment is repurchased or the lease is terminated. At the end of the initial term, we had the option to repurchase the property and equipment at a price to be negotiated with the Buyer-lessor or terminate the lease arrangement, return the property and (possibly) enter into a new lease agreement. During the fiscal second quarter ended July 1, 2018, we gave notice to the Buyer-lessor that we intended to negotiate with the Buyer-lessor the purchase of the property and equipment at the end of the initial term and have had discussions negotiating the repurchase price for the property and equipment. According to the agreement and subject to certain legal interpretations, if the parties do not reach an agreement to purchase the property and equipment at the end of the initial term, the lease will automatically renew for another year, after which the lease will automatically be renewed for successive 6-month periods, provided that each of the Company and the Buyer-lessor have a right to terminate the lease 30 days prior to the end of each 6-month renewal period. A security deposit for the leaseback was retained by the third-party financing company and will be refunded to us at the end of the lease term. The balance of the security deposit was $9.1 million as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and was included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The transaction did not meet the criteria for sale-leaseback accounting as the security deposit constitutes a continuing involvement. Therefore, we are accounting for this arrangement as a financing and recorded a financing obligation amounting to $36.3 million at inception.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Company and the Buyer-lessor agreed on a repurchase price of $21.0 million for the property and equipment, net of the security deposit, by entering into a settlement agreement to resolve the outstanding legal proceedings with respect to the lease arrangement.\nHistorical cash flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the periods shown\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal year ended January 3, 2021\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $46.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021.

We believe our organizational structure allows us the necessary flexibility to move funds throughout our subsidiaries to meet our operational working capital needs.\nThe following table details our debt outstanding as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dollar Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,243.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Euro Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2028 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2025 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts Receivable Financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sale and Leaseback Financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized original issue discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,718.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,599.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (160.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (156.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,558.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,442.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled $37.5 million and $34.6 million, respectively, which reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $312.5 million and $315.4 million as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. Our debt agreements contain various covenants that may restrict our ability to borrow on available credit facilities and future financing arrangements or require us to remain below a specific credit coverage threshold. We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance with these covenants.\nOn June 6, 2017, we amended the Credit Agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other amendments, provide for the Incremental Term Loan of $200.0 million. The net proceeds of approximately $197.6 million were used primarily to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our existing Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 8, 2018, we entered into a second amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, pursuant to which we refinanced our Dollar Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The net proceeds of approximately $101.3 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our existing Dollar Term Loan Facility and general corporate purposes. As part of the refinancing, we extended the maturity dates of our Dollar Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility to June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2023, respectively, subject to certain other limitations.\nWe accounted for the portion of lenders whose participation in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities terminated on June 8, 2018 as an extinguishment of debt. The remaining lenders that continued their participation in the Dollar Term Loan Facility and the extension of the Revolving Credit Facility were accounted for as a modification of our existing indebtedness. During the fiscal second quarter ended July 1, 2018, we recorded a $2.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt included as a component of Other expense (income), net\u201d, primarily related to unamortized debt issuance costs and investor discount costs. We incurred original issue discount costs of $5.8 million related to the Dollar Term Loan Facility, which was capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the Dollar Term Loan Facility. We also incurred lender fees and third party fees of $5.0 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility, which was included in other assets and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the amended Revolving Credit Facility. As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 , the remaining balance of deferred financing costs related to the Dollar Term Loan Facility was $17.3 million and $20.9 million, respectively. As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 , the remaining unamortized balance related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $3.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The effective interest rate of the Dollar Term Loan Facility as of January 3, 2021 is 5.65%. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, we expensed $18.5 million of debt refinancing costs, included in Other operating expense, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn January 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, which amended the financial covenant contained therein. After giving effect to the amendment, the financial covenant is tested when borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed $105 million at any period end reporting date and provides that Holdings will not permit the first lien net leverage ratio as of the end of such fiscal quarter of the Lux Co-Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to be greater than (i) 6.00:1.00 for each fiscal\nquarter ending after January 7, 2020 and on or prior to June 30, 2021, (ii) 5.50:1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending after June 30, 2021 and on or prior to September 30, 2022 and (iii) 5.00:1:00 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter.\nOn January 27, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement, where we entered into the Euro Term Loan Facility in an amount equal to the Euro-equivalent of $375 million, which bears interest at a rate of Euribor + 350 basis points per annum. The Euro Term Loan Facility will mature on June 30, 2025. The Euro Term Loan Facility is expected to amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the original aggregate principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. We incurred deferred financing costs of $5.4 million related to the Euro Term Loan Facility, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the Euro Term Loan Facility.\nOn February 5, 2021, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased the Revolving Credit Facility contained in the credit agreement by $150 million to an aggregate amount of $500 million and extended the maturity date to February 5, 2026, provided that such date may be accelerated subject to certain circumstances as set forth in the fifth amendment. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Term Loan Facility and Euro Term Loan Facility (and any Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) with respect thereto that matures on or prior to June 30, 2025) outstanding as of March 31, 2025 exceeds $500 million then the maturity date with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility shall be March 31, 2025. All other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will remain substantially the same except as otherwise amended by the fifth amendment.\nOn February 5, 2021 and February 9, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to repay $706.6 million and $186.1 million, respectively, of borrowings under the Dollar Term Loan Facility. In aggregate, we repaid $892.7 million of borrowings under the Dollar Term Loan Facility.\nOn January 27, 2020, we issued $675 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.250% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2020. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The 2028 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and the 2028 Notes and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the Lux Co-Issuer's and U.S. Co-Issuer's (together, the Issuers\u201d) and guarantors' existing and future senior debt, including the 2025 Notes. The 2028 Notes and the guarantees thereof are effectively subordinated to any of the Issuers' and guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Financing Program, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 2028 Notes and the guarantees thereof rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers' and guarantors' future subordinated debt and will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. We incurred deferred financing costs of $12.9 million related to the 2028 Notes, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the 2028 Notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the $675 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes, we entered into a $350 million U.S. dollar equivalent swap to Japanese Yen-denominated interest at a weighted average rate of 5.56%, for a five-year term. On February 5, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to redeem $270 million of the 2028 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $19.6 million of redemption premium.\nOn June 11, 2020, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2020. The 2025 Notes will mature on June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes are our unsecured obligations and the 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers' and guarantors' existing and future senior debt, including the 2028 Notes. The 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof are effectively subordinated to any of the Issuers' and guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Financing Program, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers' and guarantors' future subordinated debt and will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuers' non-guarantor subsidiaries. We incurred deferred financing costs of $7.5 million related to the 2025 Notes, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the 2025 Notes. On February 5, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to redeem $160 million of the 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $11.8 million of redemption premium.\nWe or our affiliates, including investment funds affiliated with Carlyle, at any time and from time to time, may purchase Senior Notes or our other indebtedness. Any such purchases may be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we, or any of our affiliates, may determine. Such purchases could result in a change to the allocation between the Issuers of the indebtedness represented by the Senior Notes and could have important tax consequences for holders of the Senior Notes.\nRestructuring activities\nWe have previously undertaken several initiatives intended to strengthen operational performance and to support building our capabilities to enable us to win in the marketplace. These activities to improve operational performance are primarily cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in procurement, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics. We expect these activities and other cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives that we will implement to reduce pre-tax operating expenses and result in aggregate cost savings of approximately $43 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we announced that we will outsource our equipment manufacturing operations in Rochester, New York and refurbishment operations in Neckargemund, Germany to a third-party contract manufacturing company. As a result of these initiatives, we had a reduction of approximately 110 positions worldwide from 2015 through 2018. These initiatives were substantially completed during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, with total charges incurred of $75.4 million. We made cash payments of $6.5 million during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and have made cumulative cash payments of $71.0 million to date, respectively, related to these initiatives. The remaining cash payments, related to severances, of approximately $0.1 million are expected to be made during the fiscal first quarter of 2021.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, we announced that we will transfer certain production lines among facilities in order to achieve operational and cost efficiencies. We estimate that the implementation of these initiatives will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $22 million, comprised of approximately $12 million in accelerated depreciation, $5 million in severance charges and $5 million in other facility-related costs. These initiatives are expected to be substantially completed during fiscal 2021. We incurred net charges of $0.1 million and incurred charges of $19.1 million during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and cumulative to date, respectively, related to these initiatives. We made cash payments of $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and we have made cumulative cash payments of $5.8 million, respectively, related to these initiatives. The majority of the remaining cash payments are expected to be made during fiscal year 2021.\nWe also expect to incur approximately $10 million of capital expenditures related to the transferred production lines. We made cash payments of $9.3 million cumulative to date for capital expenditures related to these initiatives.\nFor additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 13, Collaborations and other relationships,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook\nShort-term liquidity outlook\nWe expect that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet debt service requirements, working capital requirements, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness or to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other current obligations will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Such cash generation is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe are focused on expanding the number of instruments placed in the field and solidifying long-term contractual relationships with customers. In order to achieve this goal, in certain jurisdictions where it is permitted, we have leveraged a reagent rental model that has been recognized as more attractive to certain customers. In this model, we lease, rather than sell, instruments to our customers. Over the term of the contract, the purchase price of the instrument is embedded in the price of the assays and reagents. Going forward, we intend to increase the number of reagent rental placements in developed markets, a strategy that we believe is beneficial to our commercial goals because it lowers our customers' upfront capital costs and therefore allows purchasing decisions to be made at the lab manager level. For these same reasons, the reagent rental model also benefits our commercial strategy in emerging markets. We believe that the shift in our sales strategy will grow our installed base, thereby increasing sales of higher-margin assays, reagents and other consumables over the life of the customer contracts and enhancing our recurring revenue and cash flows. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, we transferred $132.3 million of instrument inventories from Inventories\u201d to Property, plant and equipment,\u201d further increasing our investment in property, plant and equipment. We currently estimate that we will transfer additional instrument inventories of approximately $126 million during fiscal 2021.\nBased on our forecasts, we believe that cash flow from operations, available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund continuing operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt agreements contain various covenants that may restrict our ability to borrow on available credit facilities and future financing arrangements and require us to remain below a specific credit coverage threshold. Our credit agreement has a financial covenant (ratio of Net First Lien Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA not to exceed 6-to-1, subject to two 50 basis point step-downs on June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022) that is tested when more than 30% of the Revolving Credit\nFacility (including letters of credit) is outstanding at the end of a fiscal quarter. As of January 3, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that we will continue to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months. In the event we do not comply with the financial covenant of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders will have the right to call on all of the borrowings under the revolving facility. If the lenders on the revolving facility terminate their commitments and accelerate the loans, this would become a cross default to other material indebtedness. We believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these covenants. However, should it become necessary, we may seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months through borrowings on credit facilities, other financing activities and/or the private sale of equity securities.\nLong-term liquidity outlook\nUK Holdco is a holding company with no business operations or assets other than the capital stock of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and intercompany loan receivables. Consequently, UK Holdco is dependent on loans, dividends, interest and other payments from its subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, meet working capital requirements and make capital expenditures. As presently structured, its operating subsidiaries are the sole source of cash for such payments and there is no assurance that the cash for those interest payments will be available. We believe our organizational structure will allow the necessary flexibility to move funds throughout our subsidiaries to meet our operational working capital needs. In the future, the Issuers and borrowers under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities may also need to refinance all or a portion of the borrowings under the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on or prior to maturity. If refinancing is necessary, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control as well as the factors described in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk factors\u201d and Special note regarding forward-looking statements.\u201d\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 3 to the

Future launch-related milestone payments of up to $60.0 million may be owed to Quotient for MosaiQ, however the future timing of when such payments would be made, if ever, is unclear at this time. See Note 13, Collaborations and other relationships,\u201d to the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Quotient relationship.\nAs of January 3, 2021, we had approximately $27.5 million of uncertain tax positions, not including interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding future timing of cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. These amounts have been excluded from the above table.\nCritical accounting estimates and summary of significant accounting policies\nThe preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting estimates discussed below represent those accounting estimates requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to our reported results.\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update, as amended, on revenue from contracts with customers. The new guidance outlined a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied; this occurs with the transfer of control of our goods or services. We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or consideration we expect to receive for transferring the goods or providing services, is determinable; and we have transferred control of the promised items to the customer. A promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer is identified as a performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nProduct revenue includes sales of consumable supplies and test kits for equipment, sales and leases of instruments, as well as services related thereto. Revenue from sales of consumable supplies and test kits is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of the respective customer contract. Revenue from instrument sales is generally recognized upon installation and customer acceptance. Service revenue on equipment and instrument maintenance contracts is recognized over the life of the service arrangement or as services are performed.\nA portion of our revenue relates to equipment lease transactions with our customers. We evaluate these leases to determine proper classification, which involves specific determinations and judgment. Revenue earned from operating leases is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which is normally five to seven years. Revenue earned from sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease, as well as a lease receivable and unearned interest associated with the lease.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. We may also enter into transactions that involve multiple performance obligations, such as the sale of products and related services. In accounting for these transactions, we allocate the consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative standalone selling price method.\nA portion of our product revenue includes revenue earned under reagent rental programs which provide customers the right to use instruments at no separate cost to the customer in consideration for a multi-year agreement to purchase reagents, assays and\nconsumables. We allocate a portion of the revenue from the future consumable sale to the instrument based on the customers' minimum volume commitment and recognize revenue at the time of the future sale of reagents, assays and consumables. The cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment, and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement. Revenue earned from operating leases is recognized over the lease term, which is normally five to seven years. Revenue earned under sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease, as well as a lease receivable and unearned interest associated with the lease. Revenue is recognized when control has transferred for the reagents, assays and consumables. Costs related to product sales are recognized at time of delivery.\nWe recognize product revenues at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration related to rebates and volume discounts. Rights of return are generally not included in our arrangements with customers. Our estimates of rebates and discounts are determined using the expected value method and take into consideration historical experience, contractual and statutory requirements, and other relevant information such as forecasted activity. These reserves reflect our best estimate of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract.\nWe enter into collaboration arrangements that generate collaboration revenue and royalty revenue from license agreements. Revenue from collaborations is presented gross\u201d where we are deemed the principal in the arrangement and net\u201d where we are deemed the agent in the arrangement.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out method. Elements of cost include raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.\nWe periodically review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based upon these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value. Historically, such write-downs have not been significant. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and earnings.\nCustomer leased instruments\nDetermining the economic life of our leased instruments requires significant accounting estimates and judgment. These estimates are based on our historical experience and existing contractual terms. Our estimate of the economic life of our instruments is ten years. We depreciate these assets over the lesser of the useful economic life and the length of the contract, which typically ranges between five and eight years. We believe these lives represent the periods during which the instruments are expected to be usable, with normal repairs and maintenance, for the purposes for which they are intended. We regularly evaluate the economic life of existing and new products for purposes of this determination.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to underlying net assets of acquired companies. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fiscal fourth quarter, unless conditions exist that would require a more frequent evaluation.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such qualitative factors may include the following: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events.\nIf we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we will perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We may also elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test, under which the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment assessment for a reporting unit should be the same whether we choose to perform the qualitative assessment or proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nIf the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill).\nWe estimate the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The inputs utilized in these analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective because it requires the use of estimates and assumptions as to our future cash flows, which includes assumed revenue growth rates, long term growth rates and discount rates. Although we base cash flow forecasts on significant assumptions, including assumed revenue growth rates, long term growth rates and discount rates, that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage our Company, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows. We also consider revenue and earnings trading multiples of the peer companies that have similar financial characteristics to the reporting units. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. Based on the degree of uncertainty, we cannot quantify the potential effect of the change in estimate on our results of operations and financial position.\nAs of December 30, 2019, the beginning of fiscal year 2020, we changed the financial information that was regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) to measure performance and allocate resources. This resulted in a change to the Company's operating segments and reporting units. Goodwill was allocated to the newly identified reporting units and we performed impairment assessments on the new reporting units following the change. Based upon our quantitative impairment tests performed as of December 30, 2019 and September 28, 2020, the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nIn-process research and development projects acquired in a business combination are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent costs related to acquired in-process research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Upon completion of the research and development process, the carrying value of acquired in- process research and development projects is reclassified as a definite-lived asset and is amortized over its useful life. If the project is abandoned, we record the write off as an impairment loss in the statement of operations. As of January 3, 2021, there are no in-process research and development intangible assets recorded within the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter ended July 2, 2017, we revised the scope of an ongoing program to develop our next generation of dry slide technology and related instrument platforms in order to prioritize certain project deliverables and deprioritize other items. We also increased the estimated costs to obtain certain regulatory approvals in international markets for the next generation of dry slide technology. As a result, we performed an impairment test of our in-process research and development project during the fiscal second quarter ended July 2, 2017 based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, which includes management's estimates of future growth rates and discount rates. Based on the assessment, a noncash impairment charge of $11.0 million was recorded to write down the in-process research and development intangible asset to its estimated fair value. This charge is included in other operating expenses, net, in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. We performed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment during the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and determined that there was no impairment. In July 2018, the in-process research and development project was completed upon the receipt of CE Mark on the related instrument. We performed a qualitative impairment assessment at the date of completion and determined there was no impairment. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the in-process research and development intangible asset was reclassified to developed technology and is subsequently being amortized over its estimated useful life of 15 years.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of other long-lived assets, such as our property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, such as technology, tradenames and customer relationships, is subjective and requires judgment. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. This impairment test may be triggered by a decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, an adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used, or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. If the fair value is less than the asset's carrying amount, we recognize a loss for the difference. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value and is based on the discounted future cash flows of the asset or quoted market prices of similar assets. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value.\nIncome taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the period. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that\na tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe do not intend to permanently reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries at this time. As such, we provide for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings. Any repatriation of undistributed earnings would be done at little or no tax cost.\nThe breadth of our operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes we will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded when management concludes that the likelihood of sustaining such positions upon examination by taxing authorities is less than more likely than not.\u201d Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in the provision for taxes on income.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation, comprised of UK Holdco stock options and restricted shares, is measured at fair value on the grant date or date of modification, as applicable. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. Our valuation model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:\nFair value of our ordinary shares-The valuation of our ordinary shares was determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. We considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine our best estimate of the fair value of our ordinary shares, including but not limited to, the following factors:\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the fact that we are a private company with illiquid securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> historical operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> discounted future cash flows, based on projected operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> financial information of comparable public companies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the risk involved in the investment, as related to earnings stability, capital structure, competition and market potential.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpected volatility-We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates and comparable companies, when estimating volatility.\nExpected term-We estimate the remaining expected life of options as the mid-point between the expected time to vest and the maturity of the options.\nRisk-free interest rate-The yield interpolated from U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury rates for a period commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements.", "summary": "The report discusses the factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of a pure-play IVD business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the discussion includes forward-looking statements related to future events and our future operating performance that are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure-play IVD business driven by our credo, Because Every Test is A Life.\u201d This guiding principle reflects the crucial role diagnostics play in global health and guides our priorities as an organization. As a leader in IVD, we impact approximately 800,000 patients every day. We are dedicated to improving outcomes for these patients and saving lives through providing innovative and reliable diagnostic testing solutions to the clinical laboratory and transfusion medicine communities. Our global infrastructure and commercial reach allow us to serve these markets with significant scale. We have an intense focus on the customer. We support our customers with high quality diagnostic instrumentation, a broad test portfolio and market leading service. Our products deliver consistently fast, accurate and reliable results that allow clinicians to make better-informed treatment decisions. Our business model generates significant recurring revenues and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high margin consumables. These consumables contribute more than 90% of our total revenue. We maintain close connectivity with our customers through our global presence, with more than 4,500 employees, including approximately 2,200 commercial sales, service and marketing teammates. This global organization allows us to support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories.\nKey components of results of operations\nNet revenue\nWe operate on a razor/razor blade\u201d model whereby we offer our customers a selection of automated instruments under long-term contracts along with the assays, reagents and other consumables that are used by these instruments to generate test results. This business model allows us to generate predictable recurring revenue and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high-margin assays, reagents and other consumables and services, sales of which represented greater than 90% of our core revenue during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We also employ a closed system\u201d strategy with our instruments, which allows only our assays, reagents and other consumables to be used by our instruments and further strengthens the predictability of our revenue. Finally, our typical customer contract length is approximately five years and we have benefitted from a good customer retention rate in recent years.\nWe manage our business geographically to better align with the market dynamics of the specific geographic region with our reportable segments being Americas, EMEA and Greater China. We generate revenue primarily in the following lines of business:\nCore:\n \u2022 Clinical Laboratories-Focused on clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments and tests to detect and monitor disease progression across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, including grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. \n \u2022 Transfusion Medicine-Focused on (i) immunohematology instruments and tests used for blood typing to ensure patient-donor compatibility in blood transfusions and (ii) donor screening instruments and tests used for blood and plasma screening for infectious diseases for customers primarily in the United States. \nNon-core:\n \u2022 Other Product Revenue-Our other product revenue includes revenues primarily from contract manufacturing. \n \u2022 Collaboration and Other Revenue-We have entered into collaboration and license agreements pursuant to which we derive collaboration and royalty revenues. \nAll non-core revenue is recorded in the Americas segment for all periods presented.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and gross profit\nThe primary components of our cost of revenue are purchased materials, the overhead costs related to our manufacturing operations and direct labor associated with the manufacture of our instruments, assays, reagents and other consumables and depreciation of customer leased instruments.\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses\nThe primary components of our selling, marketing and administrative expenses are employee-related costs in our sales, marketing and administrative and support functions, marketing costs, distribution costs and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs. Employee-related costs include compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions, employee recruiting and relocation expenses, employee training costs and travel-related costs.\nResearch and development expense\nThe primary components of our research and development expense are costs related to clinical trials and regulatory-related spending, as well as employee-related costs in these functions, and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets consists solely of the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Ortho from Johnson and Johnson by Carlyle.\nOther operating expense, net\nThe primary components of other operating expense, net, are profit share expense related to our Joint Business and restructuring charges.\nInterest expense, net\nThe primary components of interest expense, net are interest charges and amortization of deferred financing charges related to our borrowings.\nTax indemnification expense (income), net\nThe primary components of tax indemnification expense (income), net are gains and losses related to certain federal, state and foreign tax matters that relate to the period prior to the Acquisition and for which we have indemnification agreements. We are subject to income tax in approximately 34 jurisdictions outside the United States. Our most significant operations outside the United States are located in China, France, Japan and the United Kingdom. For these jurisdictions for which we have significant operations, the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction, with 2013 being the oldest tax year still open. We are currently under audit in certain jurisdictions for tax years under the responsibility of Johnson & Johnson. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, all tax liabilities related to these tax years will be indemnified by Johnson & Johnson.\nOther expense (income), net\nThe primary components of other expense (income), net are foreign currency related gains and losses, including unrealized gains and losses on intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries, and losses related to early extinguishment of certain borrowings.\nImpact of the initial public offering\nUse of proceeds and impact of debt extinguishment\nOn February 1, 2021, we completed the IPO of our ordinary shares at a price of $17.00 per share. We issued and sold 76,000,000 ordinary shares in the IPO, and issued and sold an additional 11,400,000 ordinary shares on February 4, 2021 pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from us, as previously disclosed in the IPO prospectus. The ordinary shares sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to (the IPO Registration Statement\u201d), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2021. Our ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol OCDX\u201d. The offering, including proceeds from the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, generated net proceeds to us of $1,426.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nWe used the net proceeds from the IPO (i) to redeem $160 million of our 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $11.8 million of redemption premium, (ii) to redeem $270 million of our 2028 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $19.6 million of redemption premium, (iii) to repay $892.7 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our Dollar Term Loan Facility and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIncremental public company expenses\nAs a new public company, we will incur significant expenses on an ongoing basis that we did not incur as a private company, including increased director and officer liability insurance expense, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal and investor and public relations expenses. These costs will generally be included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.\nStock-based compensation expense\nIn connection with our IPO, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we may incur a one-time stock-based compensation expense related to options held by certain members of management that may vest upon the completion of certain liquidity and realization events. Furthermore, we implemented a new long-term equity incentive plan during 2021 in connection with our IPO in order to align our equity compensation program with public company plans and practices.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2020, as the global COVID-19 pandemic began to affect certain countries, we began to see a decrease in the number of tests run in China in February, which spread to certain countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific ( ASPAC\u201d) in early March and resulted in a worldwide decrease in the number of tests run globally by the end of March. In many countries, we experienced a lag between the timing of the decrease in number of tests run and the decrease in shipments of additional products to our customers. The decrease in shipments to our customers began to occur during the fiscal second quarter ended June 28, 2020 in many countries, including the United States. During the fiscal third quarter ended September 27, 2020 and the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 3, 2021, we did experience some recovery in the base business of our core revenue, further supplemented with sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests, mainly in the North America region. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced decreased revenues, incurred idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight and higher distribution costs compared to the prior year for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We believe that the decrease in the number of tests run by medical institutions is a result of government-imposed lockdown or stay at home orders and delays in elective medical procedures and we expect this will continue to negatively impact our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA during the remainder of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that once these government measures are lifted or relaxed, demand will begin to slowly return.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we mobilized our research and development teams in order to bring to market COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We have received a combination of Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, authority to affix a CE Mark for sale in the European Union and various other regulatory approvals globally for our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We continue to work on gaining further regulatory approvals to sell the tests in other markets worldwide. Our COVID-19 antibody tests detect whether a patient has been previously infected by COVID-19 and our COVID-19 antigen test detects whether a patient is currently infected by COVID-19. All three of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests run on our existing instruments.\nWe are continually monitoring our business continuity plans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the fact that our products and services are considered to be medically critical, our manufacturing and research and development sites are generally exempt from governmental orders in the United States and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. For these sites, we have taken steps to protect our employees, and the majority of our office-based work is being conducted remotely. We have also implemented strict travel restrictions, which has reduced our travel-related operating expenses.\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing matter, our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nResults of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nFiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended December 29, 2019\nOverview of results\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, reported net loss of $211.9 million increased by $55.0 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Our results were materially impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, as net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations. We also incurred higher idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight costs and higher distribution costs, which were partially offset by cost containment measures to incur lower employee-related costs and lower travel-related costs. Our results were also affected by a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million, higher foreign currency losses, primarily unrealized, and losses on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million, or 2.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations, which was primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against a variety of currencies. The decrease in net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currency\nexchange, was mainly driven by lower revenues in our Clinical Laboratories business in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million, as well as lower revenues in our Transfusion Medicine business in all regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Clinical Laboratories business in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. The decrease in net revenue was also impacted by lower other product revenue due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nThe following table shows total net revenue by line of business:\n\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 increased by $11.9 million, or 1.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This increase included operational net revenue gains of 2.3% partially offset by a negative impact of 1.2% from foreign currency fluctuations. Clinical Laboratories revenue increased in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. These increases were offset by lower revenues in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to decreased shipments to customers as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $17.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 3.3% partially offset by a positive impact of 0.3% from foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments to customers in all regions as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-core revenue\nOther Product Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $28.8 million, or 77.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues related to our HCV/HIV license agreements, partially offset by $7.5 million of license revenue related to the Joint Business granting a customer a license to sell certain products in Canada.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to idle or underutilized facility costs of $14.8 million and freight costs of $6.9 million incurred as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, which were primarily related to depreciation related charges incurred in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 related to assets no longer in use due to the transfer of certain production lines. See -Restructuring activities.\u201d\nOperating expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of certain operating expenses:\n\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses were $489.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, or 27.7% of net revenue, as compared with $515.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, or 28.6% of net revenue, a decrease of $25.5 million. The decrease in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation and severance expense, and decreased travel-related costs, partially offset by increased distribution costs and increased third-party costs.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense was $112.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, or 6.4% of net revenue, as compared with research and development expense of $98.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, or 5.4% of net revenue, an increase of $14.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million made to Quotient upon the signing of a binding letter agreement and costs incurred to perform research and development activities related to developing our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $131.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 as compared with $131.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no major changes in the composition of our intangible assets in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nOther operating expense, net\nOther operating expense, net, was $35.3 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, as compared with $48.8 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, a decrease of $13.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit share expense in the current year from lower revenue related to our Joint Business.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense was $198.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, compared with $231.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease of $33.2 million was primarily related to lower interest rates on the Dollar Term Loan Facility.\nTax indemnification expense, net\nTax indemnification expense was $31.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain U.S. federal and state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense. Tax indemnification expense was $29.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $84.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and primarily related to $69.5 million of foreign currency losses, of which $68.2 million was unrealized and loss on early extinguishment of the 2022 Notes of $12.6 million. The unrealized foreign currency losses are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nOther expense, net was $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and primarily related to $16.0 million of fair value losses on interest rate caps that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by $10.5 million of net foreign currency\ngains, of which $18.1 million was unrealized. The unrealized foreign currency gains are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nBenefit from income taxes\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $225.3 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $13.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) partially offset by an increase in certain post-Acquisition non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions, and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $180.8 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $23.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 13.3%. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance, (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition state and non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) an increase in our interest expense on prior year reserves for uncertain tax positions and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nFiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\nOverview of results\nReported net loss of $156.9 million decreased $91.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease in net loss during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to higher revenues, lower cost of revenue, primarily due to lower restructuring-related costs, lower debt refinancing costs and lower foreign exchange related losses. These items were partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative costs, primarily driven by increased stock-based compensation expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 increased by $14.2 million, or 0.8%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $29 million, primarily driven by changes in the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi, Euro, British Pound and Brazilian Real. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was driven primarily by increased revenues in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, the impact of which is included in our Clinical Laboratories business, as well as increased revenues in China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, primarily related to our Clinical Laboratories business. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues related to our Donor Screening business within Transfusion Medicine in Japan and other product and collaboration revenues, which are included in our U.S. results.\nThe following table shows net revenue by line of business:\n\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue increased $39.8 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $22 million, the increase in Clinical Laboratories revenue was primarily driven by reagent sales in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, and instrument sales in China. These increases were partially offset by lower instrument sales in North America.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue decreased $18.1 million, or 2.9%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $9 million, the decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily driven by decreased reagent sales in Japan in the Donor Screening business, partially offset by increased reagent sales in the Immunohematology business.\nNon-core revenue\nOther product revenue, related to our contract manufacturing business, increased $1.3 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 primarily due to the timing of completion of certain performance obligations.\nCollaboration and other revenue during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 decreased $8.8 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to lower revenues recorded related to our HCV/HIV license agreements.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\n\nThe decrease in cost of revenue and increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 was primarily due to $20.8 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. This was partially offset by higher revenues primarily due to an increase in volume of reagent sales in our core business in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. See -Restructuring activities.\u201d\nOperating expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of certain", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the discussion includes forward-looking statements related to future events and our future operating performance that are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure-play IVD business driven by our credo, Because Every Test is A Life.\u201d This guiding principle reflects the crucial role diagnostics play in global health and guides our priorities as an organization. As a leader in IVD, we impact approximately 800,000 patients every day. We are dedicated to improving outcomes for these patients and saving lives through providing innovative and reliable diagnostic testing solutions to the clinical laboratory and transfusion medicine communities. Our global infrastructure and commercial reach allow us to serve these markets with significant scale. We have an intense focus on the customer. We support our customers with high quality diagnostic instrumentation, a broad test portfolio and market leading service. Our products deliver consistently fast, accurate and reliable results that allow clinicians to make better-informed treatment decisions. Our business model generates significant recurring revenues and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high margin consumables. These consumables contribute more than 90% of our total revenue. We maintain close connectivity with our customers through our global presence, with more than 4,500 employees, including approximately 2,200 commercial sales, service and marketing teammates. This global organization allows us to support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories.\nKey components of results of operations\nNet revenue\nWe operate on a razor/razor blade\u201d model whereby we offer our customers a selection of automated instruments under long-term contracts along with the assays, reagents and other consumables that are used by these instruments to generate test results. This business model allows us to generate predictable recurring revenue and strong cash flow streams from ongoing sales of high-margin assays, reagents and other consumables and services, sales of which represented greater than 90% of our core revenue during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We also employ a closed system\u201d strategy with our instruments, which allows only our assays, reagents and other consumables to be used by our instruments and further strengthens the predictability of our revenue. Finally, our typical customer contract length is approximately five years and we have benefitted from a good customer retention rate in recent years.\nWe manage our business geographically to better align with the market dynamics of the specific geographic region with our reportable segments being Americas, EMEA and Greater China. We generate revenue primarily in the following lines of business:\nCore:\n \u2022 Clinical Laboratories-Focused on clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments and tests to detect and monitor disease progression across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, including grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. \n \u2022 Transfusion Medicine-Focused on (i) immunohematology instruments and tests used for blood typing to ensure patient-donor compatibility in blood transfusions and (ii) donor screening instruments and tests used for blood and plasma screening for infectious diseases for customers primarily in the United States. \nNon-core:\n \u2022 Other Product Revenue-Our other product revenue includes revenues primarily from contract manufacturing. \n \u2022 Collaboration and Other Revenue-We have entered into collaboration and license agreements pursuant to which we derive collaboration and royalty revenues. \nAll non-core revenue is recorded in the Americas segment for all periods presented.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and gross profit\nThe primary components of our cost of revenue are purchased materials, the overhead costs related to our manufacturing operations and direct labor associated with the manufacture of our instruments, assays, reagents and other consumables and depreciation of customer leased instruments.\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses\nThe primary components of our selling, marketing and administrative expenses are employee-related costs in our sales, marketing and administrative and support functions, marketing costs, distribution costs and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs. Employee-related costs include compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions, employee recruiting and relocation expenses, employee training costs and travel-related costs.\nResearch and development expense\nThe primary components of our research and development expense are costs related to clinical trials and regulatory-related spending, as well as employee-related costs in these functions, and an allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets consists solely of the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Ortho from Johnson and Johnson by Carlyle.\nOther operating expense, net\nThe primary components of other operating expense, net, are profit share expense related to our Joint Business and restructuring charges.\nInterest expense, net\nThe primary components of interest expense, net are interest charges and amortization of deferred financing charges related to our borrowings.\nTax indemnification expense (income), net\nThe primary components of tax indemnification expense (income), net are gains and losses related to certain federal, state and foreign tax matters that relate to the period prior to the Acquisition and for which we have indemnification agreements. We are subject to income tax in approximately 34 jurisdictions outside the United States. Our most significant operations outside the United States are located in China, France, Japan and the United Kingdom. For these jurisdictions for which we have significant operations, the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction, with 2013 being the oldest tax year still open. We are currently under audit in certain jurisdictions for tax years under the responsibility of Johnson & Johnson.

We issued and sold 76,000,000 ordinary shares in the IPO, and issued and sold an additional 11,400,000 ordinary shares on February 4, 2021 pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from us, as previously disclosed in the IPO prospectus. The ordinary shares sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to (the IPO Registration Statement\u201d), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2021. Our ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol OCDX\u201d. The offering, including proceeds from the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, generated net proceeds to us of $1,426.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nWe used the net proceeds from the IPO (i) to redeem $160 million of our 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $11.8 million of redemption premium, (ii) to redeem $270 million of our 2028 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon and $19.6 million of redemption premium, (iii) to repay $892.7 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our Dollar Term Loan Facility and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIncremental public company expenses\nAs a new public company, we will incur significant expenses on an ongoing basis that we did not incur as a private company, including increased director and officer liability insurance expense, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal and investor and public relations expenses. These costs will generally be included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.\nStock-based compensation expense\nIn connection with our IPO, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we may incur a one-time stock-based compensation expense related to options held by certain members of management that may vest upon the completion of certain liquidity and realization events. Furthermore, we implemented a new long-term equity incentive plan during 2021 in connection with our IPO in order to align our equity compensation program with public company plans and practices.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2020, as the global COVID-19 pandemic began to affect certain countries, we began to see a decrease in the number of tests run in China in February, which spread to certain countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific ( ASPAC\u201d) in early March and resulted in a worldwide decrease in the number of tests run globally by the end of March. In many countries, we experienced a lag between the timing of the decrease in number of tests run and the decrease in shipments of additional products to our customers. The decrease in shipments to our customers began to occur during the fiscal second quarter ended June 28, 2020 in many countries, including the United States. During the fiscal third quarter ended September 27, 2020 and the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 3, 2021, we did experience some recovery in the base business of our core revenue, further supplemented with sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests, mainly in the North America region. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced decreased revenues, incurred idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight and higher distribution costs compared to the prior year for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. We believe that the decrease in the number of tests run by medical institutions is a result of government-imposed lockdown or stay at home orders and delays in elective medical procedures and we expect this will continue to negatively impact our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA during the remainder of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that once these government measures are lifted or relaxed, demand will begin to slowly return.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we mobilized our research and development teams in order to bring to market COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We have received a combination of Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, authority to affix a CE Mark for sale in the European Union and various other regulatory approvals globally for our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. We continue to work on gaining further regulatory approvals to sell the tests in other markets worldwide. Our COVID-19 antibody tests detect whether a patient has been previously infected by COVID-19 and our COVID-19 antigen test detects whether a patient is currently infected by COVID-19. All three of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests run on our existing instruments.\nWe are continually monitoring our business continuity plans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the fact that our products and services are considered to be medically critical, our manufacturing and research and development sites are generally exempt from governmental orders in the United States and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. For these sites, we have taken steps to protect our employees, and the majority of our office-based work is being conducted remotely. We have also implemented strict travel restrictions, which has reduced our travel-related operating expenses.\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing matter, our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nResults of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nFiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended December 29, 2019\nOverview of results\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, reported net loss of $211.9 million increased by $55.0 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Our results were materially impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, as net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations. We also incurred higher idle or underutilized facilities costs, higher freight costs and higher distribution costs, which were partially offset by cost containment measures to incur lower employee-related costs and lower travel-related costs. Our results were also affected by a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million, higher foreign currency losses, primarily unrealized, and losses on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $35.3 million, or 2.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 included operational net revenue declines of 1.3% and a negative impact of 0.7% from foreign currency fluctuations, which was primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against a variety of currencies. The decrease in net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currency\nexchange, was mainly driven by lower revenues in our Clinical Laboratories business in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million, as well as lower revenues in our Transfusion Medicine business in all regions due primarily to the global COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Clinical Laboratories business in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. The decrease in net revenue was also impacted by lower other product revenue due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nThe following table shows total net revenue by line of business:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical Laboratories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfusion Medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 580.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 598.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,734.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,740.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Product Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,766.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 increased by $11.9 million, or 1.0%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This increase included operational net revenue gains of 2.3% partially offset by a negative impact of 1.2% from foreign currency fluctuations. Clinical Laboratories revenue increased in the North America region related to sales of our COVID-19 antibody tests and other assays, instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. These increases were offset by lower revenues in the EMEA, Greater China and other regions due primarily to decreased shipments to customers as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower local HCV revenue in the Japan region of approximately $18 million.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $17.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. This decrease included operational net revenue declines of 3.3% partially offset by a positive impact of 0.3% from foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments to customers in all regions as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-core revenue\nOther Product Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $28.8 million, or 77.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.2%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues related to our HCV/HIV license agreements, partially offset by $7.5 million of license revenue related to the Joint Business granting a customer a license to sell certain products in Canada.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of net\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of net\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 908.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 922.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 858.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to idle or underutilized facility costs of $14.8 million and freight costs of $6.9 million incurred as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared with the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, which were primarily related to depreciation related charges incurred in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 related to assets no longer in use due to the transfer of certain production lines.

The decrease in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation and severance expense, and decreased travel-related costs, partially offset by increased distribution costs and increased third-party costs.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense was $112.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, or 6.4% of net revenue, as compared with research and development expense of $98.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, or 5.4% of net revenue, an increase of $14.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a research and development upfront payment of $7.5 million made to Quotient upon the signing of a binding letter agreement and costs incurred to perform research and development activities related to developing our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $131.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 as compared with $131.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no major changes in the composition of our intangible assets in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nOther operating expense, net\nOther operating expense, net, was $35.3 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, as compared with $48.8 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, a decrease of $13.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit share expense in the current year from lower revenue related to our Joint Business.\nNon-operating items\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense was $198.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, compared with $231.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. The decrease of $33.2 million was primarily related to lower interest rates on the Dollar Term Loan Facility.\nTax indemnification expense, net\nTax indemnification expense was $31.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain U.S. federal and state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense. Tax indemnification expense was $29.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, and was primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves upon the settlement of certain state tax matters, with an offsetting benefit recorded to income tax expense.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $84.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and primarily related to $69.5 million of foreign currency losses, of which $68.2 million was unrealized and loss on early extinguishment of the 2022 Notes of $12.6 million. The unrealized foreign currency losses are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nOther expense, net was $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and primarily related to $16.0 million of fair value losses on interest rate caps that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by $10.5 million of net foreign currency\ngains, of which $18.1 million was unrealized. The unrealized foreign currency gains are mainly related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected subsidiaries.\nBenefit from income taxes\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $225.3 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $13.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) partially offset by an increase in certain post-Acquisition non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions, and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, we incurred a loss before benefit from income taxes of $180.8 million and recognized a benefit from income taxes of $23.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 13.3%. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to (1) the impact of operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of a valuation allowance, (2) a decrease in our pre-Acquisition state and non-U.S. reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of certain tax matters, (3) an increase in our interest expense on prior year reserves for uncertain tax positions and (4) non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that are different than the U.S. statutory rate.\nFiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\nOverview of results\nReported net loss of $156.9 million decreased $91.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. The decrease in net loss during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was primarily due to higher revenues, lower cost of revenue, primarily due to lower restructuring-related costs, lower debt refinancing costs and lower foreign exchange related losses. These items were partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative costs, primarily driven by increased stock-based compensation expense.\nNet revenue\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 increased by $14.2 million, or 0.8%, compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $29 million, primarily driven by changes in the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi, Euro, British Pound and Brazilian Real. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 was driven primarily by increased revenues in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, the impact of which is included in our Clinical Laboratories business, as well as increased revenues in China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, primarily related to our Clinical Laboratories business. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues related to our Donor Screening business within Transfusion Medicine in Japan and other product and collaboration revenues, which are included in our U.S. results.\nThe following table shows net revenue by line of business:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical Laboratories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,102.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfusion Medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 598.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 616.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,740.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,718.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Product Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration and Other Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,787.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore revenue\nClinical Laboratories revenue increased $39.8 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $22 million, the increase in Clinical Laboratories revenue was primarily driven by reagent sales in Japan, primarily as a result of a supply agreement related to our HCV business, China, North America, LATAM, and ASPAC, and instrument sales in China. These increases were partially offset by lower instrument sales in North America.\nTransfusion Medicine revenue decreased $18.1 million, or 2.9%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately $9 million, the decrease in Transfusion Medicine revenue was primarily driven by decreased reagent sales in Japan in the Donor Screening business, partially offset by increased reagent sales in the Immunohematology business.\nNon-core revenue\nOther product revenue, related to our contract manufacturing business, increased $1.3 million, or 3.6%, during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 primarily due to the timing of completion of certain performance obligations.\nCollaboration and other revenue during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 decreased $8.8 million compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to lower revenues recorded related to our HCV/HIV license agreements.\nCost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and Gross profit\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 922.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 930.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 879.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 856.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cost of revenue and increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 was primarily due to $20.8 million of lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018.
