For these statements, we claim the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in such Section. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance, dividend policy and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Likewise, all of our statements regarding anticipated growth in our portfolio from operations, acquisitions and anticipated market conditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events.

We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:\n\u2022 the factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth under the heading \"Business,\" Risk Factors,\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\";\n\u2022 changes in our industry, the real estate markets, either nationally or in Manhattan or the greater New York metropolitan area;\n\u2022 resolution of legal proceedings involving the company;\n\u2022 reduced demand for office or retail space;\n\u2022 new office development in our market;\n\u2022general volatility of the capital and credit markets and the market price of our Class A common stock and our publicly-traded OP Units;\n\u2022 changes in our business strategy;\n\u2022 changes in technology and market competition, which affect utilization of our broadcast or other facilities;\n\u2022 changes in domestic or international tourism, including geopolitical events and currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 defaults on, early terminations of, or non-renewal of leases by, tenants;\n\u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a significant number of smaller tenants;\n\u2022 fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022 increased operating costs;\n\u2022 declining real estate valuations and impairment charges;\n\u2022 termination or expiration of our ground leases;\n\u2022 availability, terms and deployment of capital;\n\u2022 our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, including our unsecured revolving credit facility;\n\u2022 our leverage;\n\u2022 decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;\n\u2022 our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022 our failure to redevelop and reposition properties successfully or on the anticipated timeline or at the anticipated costs;\n\u2022 difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;\n\u2022 risks of real estate development (including our Metro Tower development site), including the cost of construction delays and cost overruns;\n\u2022 inability to manage our properties and our growth effectively;\n\u2022 inability to make distributions to our securityholders in the future;\n\u2022 impact of changes in governmental regulations, tax law and rates and similar matters;\n\u2022 failure to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT;\n\u2022 a future terrorist event in the U.S.;\n\u2022 environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 lack or insufficient amounts of insurance;\n\u2022 misunderstanding of our competition;\n\u2022 changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates;\n\u2022 inability to comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to similar companies; and\n\u2022 risks associated with security breaches through cyberattacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our technology (IT) networks related systems, which support our operations and our buildings.\nWhile forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance.

We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 501,653 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for these five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 380,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 204,452 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations and broadcasting licenses, and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail leases\n</td> <td>9,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements & other income\n</td> <td>24,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Observatory operations\n</td> <td>124,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcasting licenses and leases\n</td> <td>28,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has: contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy; raise our rental rates; increase our rentable square feet; increase our aggregate rental revenue; lengthen our average lease term; increase our average lease size; and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include: restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies; elevator modernization; renovated public areas and bathrooms; refurbished or new windows; upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage; fa\u00e7ade restorations; modernization of building-wide systems; and enhanced tenant amenities. We\nhave also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants and to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2016, we have invested a total of approximately $719.0 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We are in the process of substantially completing the redevelopment and repositioning program as originally contemplated. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, excluding principal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018, and we have total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years and 83.6% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 14.9% as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of March 27, 2015, we no longer solicited new business for our construction management business. We have since completed all projects that were in progress and closed that business.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and results of operations

income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to a decrease in property operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nObservatory Revenue\nThe increase in observatory revenues was due to increased tourist visits, ticket price increases, changes in ticket mix and more favorable weather conditions in 2016.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to the wind-down of activities in managed entities.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees was primarily due to higher lease cancellation income of $5.7 million in 2016, partially offset by a $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee received in 2015.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe decrease in property operating expenses was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance costs and lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was due to $5.2 million related to higher 2016 incentive compensation bonus accruals and salaries, $4.2 million related to higher equity compensation expense and $1.7 million of incremental legal costs pertaining to formation transactions litigation.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe decrease in Observatory expenses primarily reflects lower personnel costs and lower professional fees.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction expenses.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nAcquisition expenses were consistent with 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to assets that became fully depreciated during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates. In March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.08%. The proceeds were partially used to repay our unsecured revolving credit facility which had a variable interest rate of 1.33% in the first quarter 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe increase in income tax expense was attributable to activities within our taxable REIT subsidiaries, primarily due to higher Observatory taxable income.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to issuance of new Class A common shares and redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nYear Ended December 31,

million. The remaining increase is primarily due to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe increase in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased tenant expense reimbursements by $6.1 million. Higher real estate tax reimbursements, electric submeter expense reimbursements and cleaning reimbursements also contributed to the increase.\nObservatory Revenue\n2015 Observatory revenues were consistent with the 2014 revenues.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations during 2015, which is reflected in the decline in construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease in third party management and other fees revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the subsequent elimination of fees due to the consolidation of these properties.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees was primarily due to lower lease cancellation income of $4.1 million offset by $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee income and increased parking income of $0.7 million.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased property operating expenses by $10.1 million.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe increase in ground rent expenses was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe variance was primarily due to private perpetual preferred exchange offering costs of $1.4 million which were incurred in the year ended 2014 and no such costs in 2015.\nObservatory Expenses\n2015 Observatory expenses were consistent with the 2014 expenses.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe decline in construction expenses correlated with the lower revenues due to the construction business ceasing operation in 2015. Construction expenses in 2015 included severance expenses of $0.9 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased real estate taxes by $5.9 million, as well as higher taxes of $5.1 million resulting from higher assessed values and rates for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nThe decrease in acquisition expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased depreciation and amortization by $23.4 million.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the write-off of $1.7 million of deferred finance costs related to the recast of the credit facility and the early repayments of mortgage loans. These higher expenses were partially offset by reductions in interest rates for debt refinanced during 2014 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes decreased due to taxable income activities within our TRSs, primarily lower taxable income related to our construction operations and Observatory operations.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required under the Code to distribute to our securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. Our charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $554.4 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOn August 23, 2016, QIA purchased 29,610,854 newly issued Class A common shares at $21.00 per share, equivalent to a 9.9% economic interest in us on a fully diluted basis (representing a 19.4% ownership of Class A common shares), however, QIA can only vote shares equivalent to 9.9% of all voting securities, with the balance of their shares to be voted by us in accord with the votes of all other voting securities. QIA has a top-up right to maintain their ownership stake at 9.9% over time. We received approximately $621.8 million in gross proceeds from the sale. Proceeds from the investment were used to pay down the $45.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including redevelopment of the portfolio and future investments.\nIn addition, for an initial period of five years from August 23, 2016, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years. As of December 31, 2016, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018. Given our current liquidity, including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, we believe we will be able to refinance the maturing debt.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn January 23, 2015, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is referred to herein as the unsecured revolving credit facility,\u201d with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and the other lenders party thereto. Merrill Lynch acted as joint lead arranger; Bank of America acted as administrative agent; and Goldman Sachs acted as syndication agent and joint lead arranger.\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility in the maximum original principal amount of $800.0 million. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.25 billion under specified circumstances. On July 6, 2016, we partially exercised the accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility from $800 million to $1.1 billion.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) a Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.875% to 1.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating; or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating. In addition, the unsecured revolving credit facility permits us to borrow at competitive bid rates determined in accordance with the procedures described in the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nMaturity. The unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial maturity of January 23, 2019. We have the option to extend the initial term of the unsecured revolving credit facility for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum leverage ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value of the loan parties and their consolidated subsidiaries will not exceed 60%, (ii) consolidated secured indebtedness will not exceed 40% of total asset value, (iii) tangible net worth will not be less than $745.4 million plus 75% of net equity proceeds received by the operating partnership (other than proceeds received within ninety (90) days after the redemption, retirement or repurchase of ownership or equity interests in the operating partnership up to the amount paid by the operating partnership in connection with such redemption, retirement or repurchase, where, the net effect is that the operating partnership shall not have increased its net worth as a result of any such proceeds), (iv) adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) to consolidated fixed charges will not be less than 1.50x, (v) the aggregate net operating income with respect to all unencumbered eligible properties to the portion of interest expense attributable to unsecured indebtedness will not be less than 1.75x, (vi) the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value will not exceed 60%, and (vii) consolidated secured recourse indebtedness will not exceed 10% of total asset value (provided, however, this covenant shall not apply at any time after either the company or the operating partnership achieves debt ratings from at least two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, and such debt ratings are Baa3 or better (in the case of a rating by Moody's) or BBB- or better (in the case of a rating by S&P or Fitch)). As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants, as described below:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial covenant\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>In Compliance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum total leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum secured debt\n</td> <td>< 40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum fixed charge coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.50x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1x\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum unencumbered interest coverage\n</td> <td>> 1.75x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5x\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum unsecured leverage\n</td> <td>< 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum secured recourse indebtedness\n</td> <td><10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum tangible net worth\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,203,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,648,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates, and requires certain customary financial reports.\nEvents of Default. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents, loss of real estate investment trust qualification, and occurrence of a change of control (defined in the definitive documentation for the unsecured credit facility).\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nDuring March 2015, we issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes (\"Series A, B and C Senior Notes\") in a private placement to entities affiliated with Prudential Capital Group. The Series A, B and C Senior Notes consist of $100 million of 3.93% Series A Senior Notes due 2025, $125 million of 4.09% Series B Senior Notes due 2027, and $125 million of 4.18% Series C Senior Notes due 2030.\nThe Series A, B and C Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the unsecured revolving credit facility. Interest on the Series A, B and C Senior Notes is payable quarterly.\nThe terms of the Series A, B and C Senior Notes include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The Series A, B and C Senior Notes also require compliance with financial ratios consistent with the unsecured credit facility including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum amount of tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, a maximum unsecured leverage ratio and a maximum amount of secured recourse indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Series A, B and C Senior Notes.\nUnsecured Term Loan Facility\nDuring August 2015, we closed on a seven year $265.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (\"term loan facility\"). The term loan facility matures on August 24, 2022. The term loan facility bears interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, a LIBOR rate, plus a spread ranging from 1.400% to 2.350%; or a base rate, plus a spread ranging from 0.400% to 1.350%. In each case such spread is determined by our leverage ratio and credit rating. Pursuant to a forward interest rate swap agreement, we effectively fixed LIBOR at 2.1485% for $265.0 million of the term loan facility for the period from August 31, 2017 through maturity.\nThe terms of the term loan facility agreement include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The term loan facility requires compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum amount of tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, a maximum unsecured leverage ratio and a maximum amount of secured recourse indebtedness. The term loan facility also contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods). These terms in the term loan facility agreement are consistent with the terms under our unsecured revolving credit facility agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the term loan facility.\nSenior Unsecured Notes - Exchangeable\nDuring August 2014, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes ( Senior Notes\u201d) due August 2019. In connection with this offering, we received net proceeds of $246.9 million, after deducting the related underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs.\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had mortgage debt outstanding of $759.0 million. During 2016, we refinanced at a lower rate a $20.2 million 6% mortgage loan secured by 10 Union Square East with a new $50.0 million mortgage loan due\n2026 which bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.7%. During 2015, we repaid a mortgage collateralized by 1359 Broadway and we repaid a mortgage collateralized by One Grand Central Place.\nLeverage Policies\nWe expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we anticipate that our board of directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor do they restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be taken (including, but not limited to, recourse or non-recourse debt and cross collateralized debt). Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage, however, we initially intend to maintain a level of indebtedness consistent with our plan to seek an investment grade credit rating. Our board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following tables summarize our tenant improvement costs, leasing commission costs and our capital expenditures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts).\nOffice Properties(1)\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>941,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,138,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>766,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>55,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>58.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Properties(4)\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total New Leases, Expansions, and Renewals\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of leases signed(2)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Square Feet\n</td> <td>50,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>93.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs per square foot(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes an aggregate of 501,653 rentable square feet of retail space in our Manhattan office properties.

In addition, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income (including net capital gains) and will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our net income to our securityholders in a manner intended to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income tax liability on our income and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.\nBefore we pay any distribution, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and obligations to make payments of principal and interest, if any. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable or make a taxable distribution of our shares in order to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax in that year.\nDistribution to Equity Holders\nDistributions and dividends have been made to equity holders in 2014, 2015 and 2016 as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>91,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>114,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash. Cash on hand was $554.4 million and $46.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds on issuance of common stock to QIA in 2016.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $15.4 million to $218.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $203.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher cash rents.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $39.5 million to $181.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $142.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher expenditures on building and tenant improvements.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $530.8 million to $470.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $(59.9) million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was from the net proceeds on issuance of common stock to QIA in 2016.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash. Cash on hand was $46.7 million and $45.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $64.6 million to $203.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $138.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to the acquisition of two properties in July 2014 and the expirations of free rent periods.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $156.8 million to $142.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of two properties in 2014 partially offset by higher expenditures on tenant improvements.\nFinancing activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities decreased by $205.4 million to $(59.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $145.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to financing associated with the acquisition of two properties in 2014.\nNet Operating Income\nOur financial reports include a discussion of property net operating income, or NOI. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i) the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii) acquisition expenses and break-up fee, or (iv) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions\nwhen comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue, generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>49,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>155,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>71,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party management and other fees\n</td> <td>(1,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition break-up fee\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Net Operating Income Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rental revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in rental revenue from the amortization of above and below-market lease assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired below-market ground leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\")\nWe present below a discussion of FFO. We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper\u201d on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we\nbelieve, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITS. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT's operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another.\nModified Funds From Operations (\"Modified FFO\")\nModified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.\nCore Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\")\nCore FFO adds back to traditionally defined FFO the following items associated with the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, and formation transactions: gain on consolidation of non-controlling entities, acquisition expenses, severance expenses and retirement equity compensation expenses. It also adds back private perpetual preferred exchange offering expenses, prepayment penalty expense, deferred financing costs write-off, acquisition expenses, gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory, net of income taxes, ground lease amortization, construction severance expenses and acquisition break-up fee. The Company presents Core FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes items associated with its IPO and formation transactions and other non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Modified FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private perpetual preferred unit distributions\n</td> <td>(936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(936\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>154,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>260,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of below-market ground leases\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modified funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>268,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment penalty expense and deferred financing costs write-off\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition break-up fee\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction severance expenses, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on settlement of lawsuit related to the Observatory, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private perpetual preferred exchange offering expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and non-controlled interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares and Operating Partnership units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>276,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>277,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nRental Revenue\nWe derive revenues primarily from rents, rent escalations, expense reimbursements and other income received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. Escalations and expense reimbursements\u201d consist of payments made by tenants to us under contractual lease obligations to reimburse a portion of the property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred at each property.\nWe believe that the average rental rates for in-place leases at our properties are generally below the current market rates, although individual leases at particular properties presently may be leased above, at or below the current market rates within its particular submarket.\nThe amount of net rental income and reimbursements that we receive depends principally on our ability to lease currently available space, re-lease space to new tenants upon the scheduled or unscheduled termination of leases or renew expiring leases and to maintain or increase our rental rates. Factors that could affect our rental incomes include, but are not limited to: local, regional or national economic conditions; an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, office or retail space; changes in market rental rates; our ability to provide adequate services and maintenance at our properties; and fluctuations in interest rates, all of which could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. Future economic or regional downturns affecting our submarkets, or downturns in our tenants' industries, could impair our ability to lease vacant space and renew or re-lease space as well as the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy at our properties.\nTenant Credit Risk\nThe economic condition of our tenants may also deteriorate, which could negatively impact their ability to fulfill their lease commitments and in turn adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy level and/or rental rates of our properties. Potential tenants may look to consolidate, reduce overhead and preserve operating capital and may also defer strategic decisions, including entering into new, long-term leases at properties.\nLeasing\nWe signed 1.0 million, 1.2 million, and 0.8 million rentable square feet of new leases, expansions and lease renewals, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nDue to the relatively small number of leases that are signed in any particular quarter, one or more larger leases may have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on average rent, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs for that period. As a result, we believe it is more appropriate when analyzing trends in average rent and tenant improvement and leasing commission costs to review activity over multiple quarters or years. Tenant improvement costs include expenditures for general improvements occurring concurrently with, but that are not directly related to, the cost of installing a new tenant. Leasing commission costs are similarly subject to significant fluctuations depending upon the length of leases being signed and the mix of tenants from quarter to quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet of space in our portfolio available to lease (excluding leases signed but not yet commenced) representing 9.8% of the net rentable square footage of the properties in our portfolio. In addition, leases representing 7.0% and 8.1% of net rentable square footage of the properties in our portfolio will expire in 2017 and in 2018, respectively. These leases are expected to represent approximately 7.0% and 8.5%, respectively, of our annualized rent for such periods. Our revenues and results of operations can be impacted by expiring leases that are not renewed or re-leased or that are renewed or re-leased at base rental rates equal to, above or below the current average base rental rates. Further, our revenues and results of operations can also be affected by the costs we incur to re-lease available space, including payment of leasing commissions, redevelopments and build-to-suit remodeling that may not be borne by the tenant.\nWe believe that as we complete the redevelopment and repositioning of our properties we will, over the long-term, experience increased occupancy levels and rents. Over the short term, as we renovate and reposition our properties, which includes aggregating smaller spaces to offer large blocks of space, we may experience lower occupancy levels as a result of having to relocate tenants to alternative space and the strategic expiration of existing leases. We believe that despite the short-term lower occupancy levels we may experience, we will continue to experience increased rental revenues as a result of the increased rents which we expect to obtain in following the redevelopment and repositioning of our properties.\nMarket Conditions\nThe properties in our portfolio are located in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, which includes Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York. Positive or negative changes in conditions in these markets, such as business hirings or layoffs or downsizing, industry growth or slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases or decreases in real estate and other taxes, costs of complying with governmental regulations or changed regulation, can impact our overall performance.\nObservatory and Broadcasting Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Empire State Building Observatory hosted 4.25 million visitors, compared to 4.06 million visitors for the same period in 2015. Observatory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $124.8 million, an 11.2% increase from $112.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there were 45 bad weather days, 13 of which fell on weekend days compared to 67 bad weather days, 15 of which fell on weekend days, in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nObservatory revenues and admissions are dependent upon the following: (i) the number of tourists (domestic and international) that come to New York City and visit the observatory, as well as any related tourism trends; (ii) the prices per admission that can be charged; (iii) seasonal trends affecting the number of visitors to the observatory; (iv) competition, in particular from other new and existing observatories; and (v) weather trends.\nWe license the use of the Empire State Building mast to third party television and radio broadcasters and providers of data communications. We also lease space in the upper floors of the building to such licensees to house their transmission equipment and related facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived $20.9 million of revenue and $8.0 million of expense reimbursements from the Empire State Building's broadcasting licenses and related leases. The broadcasting licenses and related leases generally expire between 2017 and 2031. The business of broadcasting TV and radio signals over the air is in flux, due to deteriorating industry fundamentals and the ongoing Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction, and there is competition from other broadcasting operations.\nWe have renewed and extended our leases with Univision Television Group from their current expirations in 2016 and 2018 to a new expiration in December 2025. Three of our existing broadcast tenants, CBS Broadcasting, NBC Universal Media and WNET, have notified us that they will vacate the Empire State Building at the end of their current lease terms. The non-renewing leases with CBS, NBC and WNET generated approximately $5.9 million in aggregate revenue in 2016, inclusive of expense reimbursements, and their leases expire in 2018. Revenue from Univision totaled approximately $2.9 million, inclusive of expense reimbursements in 2015. Effective January 2016, annual revenue from Univision adjusted to an initial amount of $1.9 million, and is subject to escalations.\nDuring 2016, we renewed and extended our lease and licenses with Emmis Communications, which operates three FM radio stations at the Empire State Building, for 16 years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from Emmis Communications totaled approximately $1.7 million (inclusive of expense reimbursements). Effective January 2016, annual revenue from Emmis Communications adjusted to an initial amount of $1.3 million, and is subject to escalations.\nWith respect to certain of our other remaining broadcasters, we have made preliminary renewal proposals which, if accepted, would yield reduced revenues and higher capital expenditures.\nWe have renewed and extended an additional lease and license with two broadcast tenants with terms subject to a confidentiality agreement.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses generally consist of depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, ground lease expenses, repairs and maintenance, security, utilities, property-related payroll, insurance and bad debt expense. Factors that may affect our ability to control these operating costs include: increases in insurance premiums, tax rates, the cost of periodic repair, redevelopment costs and the cost of re-leasing space, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws and interest rate levels. If our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our future cash flow and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances, such as market factors and competition, cause a reduction in income from the property. If revenues drop, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes and maintenance generally, will not be materially reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. As a result, if revenues decrease in the future, static operating costs may adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations. If similar economic conditions exist in the future, we may experience future losses.\nCost of Funds and Interest Rates\nWe expect future changes in interest rates will impact our overall performance. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility through the use of hedging instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we entered into forward starting interest rate LIBOR swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of $890.0 million that fixed LIBOR rates at pay rates between 2.1485% to 2.7620% for periods from July 2017 to June 2028. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates. As of December 31, 2016, our variable rate debt represented 16.4% of our indebtedness and 3.4% of total enterprise value. This variable rate debt included $265.0 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2016. Our variable rate debt may increase to the extent we use available borrowing capacity to fund capital improvements. We continually evaluate our debt maturities, and, based on management's current assessment, believe we have viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact our expected financial results. As of December 31, 2016, excluding principal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018.\nCompetition\nThe leasing of real estate is highly competitive in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan market in which we operate. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial real estate, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The principal means of competition are rent charged, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased. In addition, we face competition from other real estate companies including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in\ntransactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue. In addition, competition from new and existing observatories and/or broadcasting operations could have a negative impact on revenues from our observatory and/or broadcasting operations. Adverse impacts on domestic travel and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also decrease demand in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, in better locations within our markets or in higher quality facilities, we may lose potential tenants and may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and with the rules and regulations of the SEC represent our assets and liabilities and operating results. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly owned subsidiaries as well as our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For purposes of comparison, certain items shown in the 2014 and 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used for 2016.\nWe consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE.\nWe will assess the accounting treatment for each investment we may have in the future. This assessment will include a review of each entity's organizational agreement to determine which party has what rights and whether those rights are protective or participating. For all VIEs, we will review such agreements in order to determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and benefit. In situations where we or our partner could approve, among other things, the annual budget, or leases that cover more than a nominal amount of space relative to the total rentable space at each property, we would not consolidate the investment as we consider these to be substantive participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that would most significantly impact the performance and benefit of such joint venture investment.\nA non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit's fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill. Non-amortizing intangible assets, such as trade names and trademarks, are subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value and amortizing intangible assets are tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nWe performed an annual review of goodwill for impairment and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. Our methodology to review goodwill impairment, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013 and believe we qualify as a REIT at December 31, 2016. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that 90% of ordinary REIT taxable income\u201d (as determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains) be distributed. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we meet the organizational and operational requirements and our distributions equal or exceed REIT taxable income. For all periods subsequent to the effective date of our REIT election, we have met the organizational and operational requirements and distributions have exceeded net taxable income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal and state income taxes.\nWe have elected to treat ESRT Observatory TRS, L.L.C., our subsidiary which holds our observatory operations, and ESRT Holdings TRS, L.L.C., our subsidiary that holds our third party management, construction (through cessation of our construction business in the first quarter of 2015), restaurant, cafeterias, health clubs and certain cleaning operations, as taxable REIT subsidiaries. Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and their operations are generally subject to regular corporate income taxes. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries account for their income taxes in accordance with GAAP, which includes an estimate of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The calculation of the taxable REIT subsidiaries' tax provisions may require interpreting tax laws and regulations and could result in the use of judgments or estimates which could cause its recorded tax liability to differ from the actual amount due. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The taxable REIT subsidiaries periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities, including the results of local, state, or federal statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used.\nWe apply provisions for measuring and recognizing tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we do not have a liability for uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2016, the tax years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2016 remain open for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, state or local authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The determination of fair value of these awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions including expected volatility of our stock, expected dividend yield, expected term, and assumptions of whether these awards will achieve parity with other operating partnership units or achieve performance thresholds. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management at the time of grant.\nSegment Reporting\nWe have identified two reportable segments: (1) Real Estate and (2) Observatory. Our real estate segment includes all activities related to the ownership, management, operation, acquisition, repositioning and disposition of our real estate assets. Our observatory segment operates the 86th and 102nd floor observatories at the Empire State Building. These two lines of businesses are managed separately because each business requires different support infrastructures, provides different services and has dissimilar economic characteristics such as investments needed, stream of revenues and different marketing strategies. We account for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. We include our construction operation in \"Other\" and includes all activities related to providing construction services to tenants and to other entities within and outside our company. As of March 27, 2015, we no longer solicited new business for our construction management business. We have since completed all projects that were in progress and closed that business.", "summary": "The report includes forward-looking statements, risks and uncertainties, and financial performance highlights for the year 2016. It also provides a comparison of financial results for the years ended 2016 and 2015.

As of December 31, 2016, our total portfolio, contained 10.1 million rentable square feet of office and retail space. We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 501,653 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for these five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 380,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 204,452 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations and broadcasting licenses, and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has: contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy; raise our rental rates; increase our rentable square feet; increase our aggregate rental revenue; lengthen our average lease term; increase our average lease size; and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include: restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies; elevator modernization; renovated public areas and bathrooms; refurbished or new windows; upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage; fa\u00e7ade restorations; modernization of building-wide systems; and enhanced tenant amenities. We\nhave also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants and to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2016, we have invested a total of approximately $719.0 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We are in the process of substantially completing the redevelopment and repositioning program as originally contemplated. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, excluding principal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018, and we have total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years and 83.6% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 14.9% as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of March 27, 2015, we no longer solicited new business for our construction management business. We have since completed all projects that were in progress and closed that business.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\n\nRental Revenue\nThe increase in rental income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to a decrease in property operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nObservatory Revenue\nThe increase in observatory revenues was due to increased tourist visits, ticket price increases, changes in ticket mix and more favorable weather conditions in 2016.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to the wind-down of activities in managed entities.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees was primarily due to higher lease cancellation income of $5.7 million in 2016, partially offset by a $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee received in 2015.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe decrease in property operating expenses was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance costs and lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was due to $5.2 million related to higher 2016 incentive compensation bonus accruals and salaries, $4.2 million related to higher equity compensation expense and $1.7 million of incremental legal costs pertaining to formation transactions litigation.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe decrease in Observatory expenses primarily reflects lower personnel costs and lower professional fees.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction expenses.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nAcquisition expenses were consistent with 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to assets that became fully depreciated during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates. In March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.08%. The proceeds were partially used to repay our unsecured revolving credit facility which had a variable interest rate of 1.33% in the first quarter 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe increase in income tax expense was attributable to activities within our taxable REIT subsidiaries, primarily due to higher Observatory taxable income.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to issuance of new Class A common shares and redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table summarizes the historical results of operations for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (amounts in thousands):\n\nRental Revenue\nThe increase in rental income was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased rental income by $38.6 million. The remaining increase is primarily due to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe increase in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased tenant expense reimbursements by $6.1 million. Higher real estate tax reimbursements, electric submeter expense reimbursements and cleaning reimbursements also contributed to the increase.\nObservatory Revenue\n2015 Observatory revenues were consistent with the 2014 revenues.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations during 2015, which is reflected in the decline in construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease in third party management and other fees revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the subsequent elimination of fees due to the consolidation of these properties.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees was primarily due to lower lease cancellation income of $4.1 million offset by $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee income and increased parking income of $0.7 million.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased property operating expenses by $10.1 million.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe increase in ground rent expenses was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe variance was primarily due to private perpetual preferred exchange offering costs of $1.4 million which were incurred in the year ended 2014 and no such costs in 2015.\nObservatory Expenses\n2015 Observatory expenses were consistent with the 2014 expenses.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe decline in construction expenses correlated with the lower revenues due to the construction business ceasing operation in 2015. Construction expenses in 2015 included severance expenses of $0.9 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased real estate taxes by $5.9 million, as well as higher taxes of $5.1 million resulting from higher assessed values and rates for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nThe decrease in acquisition expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased depreciation and amortization by $23.4 million.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the write-off of $1.7 million of deferred finance costs related to the recast of the credit facility and the early repayments of mortgage loans. These higher expenses were partially offset by reductions in interest rates for debt refinanced during 2014 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes decreased due to taxable income activities within our TRSs, primarily lower taxable income related to our construction operations and Observatory operations.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required under the Code to distribute to our securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. Our charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $554.4 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOn August 23, 2016, QIA purchased 29,610,854 newly issued Class A common shares at $21.00 per share, equivalent to a 9.9% economic interest in us on a fully diluted basis (representing a 19.4% ownership of Class A common shares), however, QIA can only vote shares equivalent to 9.9% of all voting securities, with the balance of their shares to be voted by us in accord with the votes of all other voting securities. QIA has a top-up right to maintain their ownership stake at 9.9% over time. We received approximately $621.8 million in gross proceeds from the sale. Proceeds from the investment were used to pay down the $45.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including redevelopment of the portfolio and future investments.\nIn addition, for an initial period of five years from August 23, 2016, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years. As of December 31, 2016, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018. Given our current liquidity, including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, we believe we will be able to refinance the maturing debt.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn January 23, 2015, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is referred to herein as the unsecured revolving credit facility,\u201d with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and the other lenders party thereto. Merrill Lynch acted as joint lead arranger; Bank of America acted as administrative agent; and Goldman Sachs acted as syndication agent and joint lead arranger.\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility in the maximum original principal amount of $800.0 million. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.25 billion under specified circumstances. On July 6, 2016, we partially exercised the accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility from $800 million to $1.1 billion.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) a Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.875% to 1.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating; or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating. In addition, the unsecured revolving credit facility permits us to borrow at competitive bid rates determined in accordance with the procedures described in the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nMaturity. The unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial maturity of January 23, 2019. We have the option to extend the initial term of the unsecured revolving credit facility for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

As of December 31, 2016, our total portfolio, contained 10.1 million rentable square feet of office and retail space. We owned 14 office properties (including three long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately 9.4 million rentable square feet of office space. Nine of these properties are located in the midtown Manhattan market and aggregate approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet of office space, including the Empire State Building. Our Manhattan office properties also contain an aggregate of 501,653 rentable square feet of premier retail space on their ground floor and/or contiguous levels. Our remaining five office properties are located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, encompassing in the aggregate approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. The majority of square footage for these five properties is located in densely populated metropolitan communities with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land at the Stamford Transportation Center in Stamford, Connecticut, adjacent to one of our office properties, that will support the development of an approximately 380,000 rentable square foot office building and garage, which we refer to herein as Metro Tower. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included four standalone retail properties located in Manhattan and two standalone retail properties located in the city center of Westport, Connecticut, encompassing 204,452 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nThe Empire State Building is our flagship property. The Empire State Building provides us with a diverse source of revenue through its office and retail leases, observatory operations and broadcasting licenses, and related leased space. Our observatory operations are a separate reporting segment. Our observatory operations are subject to regular patterns of tourist activity in Manhattan. During the past ten years, approximately 16% to 18% of our annual observatory revenue was realized in the first quarter, 26.0% to 28.0% was realized in the second quarter, 31.0% to 33.0% was realized in the third quarter, and 23.0% to 25.0% was realized in the fourth quarter.\nThe components of the Empire State Building revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail leases\n</td> <td>9,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements & other income\n</td> <td>24,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Observatory operations\n</td> <td>124,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadcasting licenses and leases\n</td> <td>28,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment and repositioning strategy of our Manhattan office properties. This strategy is designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and has: contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts, which seek to increase our occupancy; raise our rental rates; increase our rentable square feet; increase our aggregate rental revenue; lengthen our average lease term; increase our average lease size; and improve our tenant credit quality. These improvements include: restored, renovated and upgraded or new lobbies; elevator modernization; renovated public areas and bathrooms; refurbished or new windows; upgrade and standardization of retail storefront and signage; fa\u00e7ade restorations; modernization of building-wide systems; and enhanced tenant amenities. We\nhave also aggregated smaller spaces in order to offer larger blocks of office space, including multiple floors, that are attractive to larger, higher credit-quality tenants and to offer new, pre-built suites with improved layouts. This strategy has shown what we believe to be attractive results to date, and we believe has the potential to improve our operating margins and cash flows in the future. We believe we will continue to enhance our tenant base and improve rents as our pre-redevelopment leases continue to expire and be re-leased. From 2002 through December 31, 2016, we have invested a total of approximately $719.0 million (excluding tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions) in our Manhattan office properties pursuant to this program. We are in the process of substantially completing the redevelopment and repositioning program as originally contemplated. We intend to fund these capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, excluding principal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018, and we have total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% (excluding premiums and discount) and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years and 83.6% of which is fixed-rate indebtedness. Our consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 14.9% as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of March 27, 2015, we no longer solicited new business for our construction management business. We have since completed all projects that were in progress and closed that business.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe discussion below relates to the financial condition and results of operations

income was primarily attributable to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe decrease in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily due to a decrease in property operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nObservatory Revenue\nThe increase in observatory revenues was due to increased tourist visits, ticket price increases, changes in ticket mix and more favorable weather conditions in 2016.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease reflects lower management fee income due to the wind-down of activities in managed entities.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe increase in other revenues and fees was primarily due to higher lease cancellation income of $5.7 million in 2016, partially offset by a $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee received in 2015.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe decrease in property operating expenses was primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance costs and lower utility costs.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe ground rent expense was consistent with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was due to $5.2 million related to higher 2016 incentive compensation bonus accruals and salaries, $4.2 million related to higher equity compensation expense and $1.7 million of incremental legal costs pertaining to formation transactions litigation.\nObservatory Expenses\nThe decrease in Observatory expenses primarily reflects lower personnel costs and lower professional fees.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe construction business ceased operations in 2015, which is reflected in the elimination of construction expenses.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to higher assessed values for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nAcquisition expenses were consistent with 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to assets that became fully depreciated during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates. In March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.08%. The proceeds were partially used to repay our unsecured revolving credit facility which had a variable interest rate of 1.33% in the first quarter 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe increase in income tax expense was attributable to activities within our taxable REIT subsidiaries, primarily due to higher Observatory taxable income.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to issuance of new Class A common shares and redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nYear Ended December 31,

million. The remaining increase is primarily due to increased rental rates.\nTenant Expense Reimbursement\nThe increase in tenant expense reimbursement was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased tenant expense reimbursements by $6.1 million. Higher real estate tax reimbursements, electric submeter expense reimbursements and cleaning reimbursements also contributed to the increase.\nObservatory Revenue\n2015 Observatory revenues were consistent with the 2014 revenues.\nConstruction Revenue\nThe construction business ceased operations during 2015, which is reflected in the decline in construction revenues.\nThird-Party Management and Other Fees\nThe decrease in third party management and other fees revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the subsequent elimination of fees due to the consolidation of these properties.\nOther Revenues and Fees\nThe decrease in other revenues and fees was primarily due to lower lease cancellation income of $4.1 million offset by $2.5 million acquisition break-up fee income and increased parking income of $0.7 million.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe increase in property operating expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased property operating expenses by $10.1 million.\nGround Rent Expenses\nThe increase in ground rent expenses was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe variance was primarily due to private perpetual preferred exchange offering costs of $1.4 million which were incurred in the year ended 2014 and no such costs in 2015.\nObservatory Expenses\n2015 Observatory expenses were consistent with the 2014 expenses.\nConstruction Expenses\nThe decline in construction expenses correlated with the lower revenues due to the construction business ceasing operation in 2015. Construction expenses in 2015 included severance expenses of $0.9 million.\nReal Estate Taxes\nThe increase in real estate taxes was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased real estate taxes by $5.9 million, as well as higher taxes of $5.1 million resulting from higher assessed values and rates for several properties.\nAcquisition Expenses\nThe decrease in acquisition expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 which increased depreciation and amortization by $23.4 million.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense was attributable to the acquisition of two properties during July 2014 and the write-off of $1.7 million of deferred finance costs related to the recast of the credit facility and the early repayments of mortgage loans. These higher expenses were partially offset by reductions in interest rates for debt refinanced during 2014 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes decreased due to taxable income activities within our TRSs, primarily lower taxable income related to our construction operations and Observatory operations.\nPrivate Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions\nRepresents distributions to holders of private perpetual preferred units which were issued in August 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nThe increase is due to an increase in net income offset by a lower non-controlling ownership percentage due to redemption of operating partnership units into Class A common shares.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required under the Code to distribute to our securityholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our securityholders.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvements allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. Our charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $554.4 million available in cash and cash equivalents and there was $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOn August 23, 2016, QIA purchased 29,610,854 newly issued Class A common shares at $21.00 per share, equivalent to a 9.9% economic interest in us on a fully diluted basis (representing a 19.4% ownership of Class A common shares), however, QIA can only vote shares equivalent to 9.9% of all voting securities, with the balance of their shares to be voted by us in accord with the votes of all other voting securities. QIA has a top-up right to maintain their ownership stake at 9.9% over time. We received approximately $621.8 million in gross proceeds from the sale. Proceeds from the investment were used to pay down the $45.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including redevelopment of the portfolio and future investments.\nIn addition, for an initial period of five years from August 23, 2016, QIA will have a right of first offer to co-invest with us as a joint venture partner in real estate investment opportunities initiated by us where we have elected, at our discretion, to seek out a joint venture partner. The right of first offer period will be extended for 30 months so long as at least one joint venture transaction is consummated by us and QIA during the initial term, and will be extended for a further 30-month term if at least one more joint venture transaction is consummated during such initial extension period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% and a weighted average maturity of 4.7 years. As of December 31, 2016, exclusive of\nprincipal amortization, we have approximately $336.0 million of debt maturing in 2017 and approximately $262.2 million of debt maturing in 2018. Given our current liquidity, including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, we believe we will be able to refinance the maturing debt.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn January 23, 2015, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is referred to herein as the unsecured revolving credit facility,\u201d with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and the other lenders party thereto. Merrill Lynch acted as joint lead arranger; Bank of America acted as administrative agent; and Goldman Sachs acted as syndication agent and joint lead arranger.\nAmount. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility in the maximum original principal amount of $800.0 million. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount to $1.25 billion under specified circumstances. On July 6, 2016, we partially exercised the accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility from $800 million to $1.1 billion.\nGuarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our obligations under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our election, (x) a Eurodollar rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.875% to 1.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating; or (y) a base rate, plus a spread that we expect will range from 0.000% to 0.600% depending upon its leverage ratio and credit rating. In addition, the unsecured revolving credit facility permits us to borrow at competitive bid rates determined in accordance with the procedures described in the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nMaturity. The unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial maturity of January 23, 2019. We have the option to extend the initial term of the unsecured revolving credit facility for up to two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.075% of the then outstanding commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFinancial Covenants. The unsecured revolving credit facility includes the following financial covenants: (i) maximum"}
