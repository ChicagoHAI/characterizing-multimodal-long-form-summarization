Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue opportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. Since January 1, 2016, we have completed the following acquisitions and dispositions:\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> On January 30, 2017, we acquired the hotel commercial unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences, a 400-unit condominium-hotel located in the Hollywood, Florida market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> On February 7, 2017, we closed on the sale of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> On March 1, 2018, we acquired the 318-room Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel located in Arlington, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.7 million, including seller credits.

We sometimes refer to each participating condominium unit as a room\u201d.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct substantially all our business through the Operating Partnership, Sotherly Hotels LP. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns an approximate 88.9% interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were contributors of our initial hotel properties and related assets.\nTo qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which then engage hotel management companies to operate the hotels under a management agreement. Our TRS Lessees have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality and Highgate Hotels to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., are\nconsolidated into each of our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. are subject to taxation similar to other C corporations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, credit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel's restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy.\nWe also use FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our wholly-owned hotels and the Hyde Resort & Residences, during each respective reporting period ( composite portfolio\u201d properties), as well as the key operating metrics for the eleven wholly-owned properties that were under our control during all of 2018 ( same-store\u201d properties). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, which was sold in February 2017, the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which was acquired in February 2018 and the Hyde Resort & Residences, which was acquired in January 2017.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $178.2 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million, or 15.5%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $154.3 million. The increase in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased revenues by approximately $18.1 million. In addition, our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, which started operations on January 30, 2017, has continued to ramp up and accounted for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period. There was also a net aggregate increase in revenues of approximately $3.1 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $15.3 million, or 14.4%, to approximately $121.0 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $105.7 million. The increase in room revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased room revenues by approximately $14.8 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in room revenues of approximately $0.5 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.6 million, or 10.5%, to approximately $38.1 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased food and beverage revenues by approximately $2.3 million. There was also a net increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $1.3 million; resulting from increases of\napproximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland and an aggregate increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $0.4 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.0 million, or 35.8 %, to approximately $19.0 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $14.0 million. The increase in revenue from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the continued ramp up of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased other operating departments revenues by approximately $1.0 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $17.2 million, or 15.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately $130.5 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $113.3 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased hotel operating expenses by approximately $12.7 million. Our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel also accounted for an increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $1.9 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $2.6 million for the period from our remaining properties.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.6 million, or 13.7%, to approximately $30.3 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase in rooms expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased room expenses by approximately $3.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in room expenses of approximately $0.4 million for the period, from the remaining properties.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.5 million, or 14.3%, to approximately $28.1 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was a net aggregate increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulting from; increases of approximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland; from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased food and beverage expenses by approximately $2.0 million from a net increase in food and beverage expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the period at the remaining properties.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $2.0 million, or 45.7%, to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in expense from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, accounted for an increase of approximately $1.0 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments expenses of approximately $1.0 million for the twelve-month period, from the remaining properties.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $8.0 million, or 13.9%, to approximately $65.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales and marketing costs, franchise fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, management fees, real and personal property taxes as well as general and administrative costs at the property level are included in indirect expenses. The increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased indirect costs by approximately $7.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in indirect expenses of approximately $0.8 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.9 million, or 22.9 %, to approximately $20.9 million compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was mostly attributable to increases in the depreciation related to our properties being renovated in Wilmington, North Carolina and Tampa, Florida, that accounted for increases of approximately $1.3 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased depreciation by approximately $2.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.4 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nGain / Loss on Disposal of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $0.5 million, compared to a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 2.4%, to approximately $6.2 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to reduced legal costs of approximately $0.1 million and the absence of aborted offering costs for 2018 as compared to aborted offering costs of approximately $0.5 million for 2017, which were offset by increased salaries by approximately $0.2 million, increased audit fees by approximately $0.1 million and increases in other costs by approximately $0.1 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $4.2 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $19.9 million compared to approximately $15.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was substantially related to the new mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington and deferred financing costs associated with the mortgage on that property accounting for an increase of approximately $2.4 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. There was also a net aggregate increase of approximately $1.6 million of interest expenses with increases on mortgages for Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida and Houston Texas, which was offset by decreases on mortgages for Laurel, Maryland; Hollywood, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, there was an increase in unsecured note interest for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $0.2 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Early Debt Extinguishment. The loss on early debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 36.1%, to approximately $0.8 million compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we refinanced the mortgage loans we had on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University, the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington with an approximate aggregate loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $0.8 million.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan we had with Bank of the Ozarks on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, with a new fixed rate loan from Bank of America. The amount of accumulated un-amortized loan costs of approximately $0.2 million was written off and we redeemed our 7% Notes which reflect the majority of the loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $1.0 million.\nUnrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. During July 2018, we purchased an interest rate cap for $204,756 and we purchased an interest rate SWAP liability for $294,176. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate caps was $94,697 compared to the fair market value of $5,213, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate SWAP was a liability of $984,677. The unrealized loss on hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $808,958 and $28,384, respectively.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.3 million to approximately $0.9 million compared to gain on involuntary conversion of assets of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, we experienced electrical damage to The Whitehall property that resulted in a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $0.6 million, which was realized in the first quarter of 2018, and damage to the DoubleTree by Hilton Hollywood Beach Resort property for approximately $0.3 million.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.2 million, or 73.0%, to approximately $0.5 million compared to an income tax provision of approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax provision was primarily derived from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees realized a net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in an income tax provision instead of an income tax benefit. However, at December 31, 2017 there was a one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate, due to the TCJA. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred tax assets total approximately $5.1 and $5.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $4.4 and $4.9 million, respectively, relate to net operating losses of our TRS Lessee. At December 31, 2018, we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be available during the carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforward. We will continue to regularly evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets.\nNet (Loss) Income. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $0.6 million, or 2,162.3%, to approximately $(0.6) million compared to net income of approximately $29.5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the operating results discussed above.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately $5.8 million, compared to approximately $3.8 million distributions to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we accrued approximately $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, as dividends on the preferred stock. These increases were due to the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock in September 2018.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for our wholly-owned hotels and the Hyde Resort & Residences during each respective reporting period ( composite portfolio\u201d properties) as well as the key operating metrics for the eleven wholly-owned properties that were under our control during all of 2016 ( same-store\u201d properties). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance of the Hyde Resort & Residences, which was acquired on January 30, 2017.\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $154.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 0.9%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $152.8 million. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from management fees earned at the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, which commenced operations on January 30, 2017, accounting for an increase of approximately $4.0 million for the period and by increases in revenues of approximately $4.7 million for the period at our properties in Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. These increases in revenue were offset by the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $4.8 million; the impact of renovation activities at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida which had reduced revenues of approximately $1.2 million in the aggregate; and by decreases in revenue realized by our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Jeffersonville, Indiana of approximately $1.3 million in the aggregate.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $2.5 million, or 2.3%, to approximately $105.7 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $108.2 million. The decrease in room revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $3.2 million. In addition, our properties impacted by renovation activities in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida had reduced revenues of approximately $2.2 million in the aggregate. Room revenue decreases of approximately $1.3 million in the aggregate were also realized by our properties in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Jeffersonville, Indiana. These decreases in room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were offset by room revenue increases of approximately $4.2 million in the aggregate at our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, which on a combined basis reflected a 1.7% decrease in occupancy, as compared to the same period in 2016.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.9 million, or 2.5%, to approximately $34.5 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in food and beverage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulted mainly from the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $1.4 million. Food and beverage revenue decreases of approximately $0.7 million were also realized by our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Jeffersonville, Indiana; Tampa, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. These decreases were offset by an increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $1.2 million at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Hollywood Beach, Florida and Houston, Texas.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $4.8 million, or 51.4%, to approximately $14.0 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $9.3 million. The increase in revenue from other operating departments for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the start of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase of approximately $4.0 million for the period and $0.3 million received by the Hollywood Beach, Florida property for construction interruption payments relating to the construction of a new building next to the property.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $0.4 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended December\n31, 2017 to approximately $113.3 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $112.8 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was substantially related to the start of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase in expenses of approximately $4.3 million for the period, which was offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $4.6 million after the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia. This net decrease of approximately $0.3 million was offset by a net increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $0.7 million for the period at all of our other properties.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $1.6 million, or 5.7%, to approximately $26.7 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After a $0.6 million reclassification reduced rooms expenses and increased indirect costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, the remaining decrease in rooms expense, resulted mainly from a decrease in expenses of approximately $1.3 million following the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia. In addition, rooms expenses decreased by approximately $0.9 million in the aggregate at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Hollywood Beach, Florida; Jeffersonville, Indiana and Tampa, Florida, which were offset by increases at our properties in Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia by approximately $0.6 million in the aggregate.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $0.2 million, or 0.9%, to approximately $24.6 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in food and beverage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was substantially related to increases for food and beverage expenses of approximately $1.7 million in the aggregate at our properties in Savannah, Georgia; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Hollywood Beach, Florida and Houston, Texas, offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $1.1 million following the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia along with decreases of approximately $0.4 million in the aggregate at our remaining properties.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $2.0 million, or 80.6%, to approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expense from other operating departments for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the acquired interest and new operations in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for an increase of approximately $2.5 million for the period, offset by a net decrease of approximately $0.5 million at our other properties.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.2%, to approximately $57.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales and marketing costs, franchise fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, management fees, real and personal property taxes as well as general and administrative costs at the property level are included in indirect expenses. After a $0.6 million reclassification reduced rooms expenses and increased indirect costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, most of the increase in indirect expenses related to expenses that increase proportionally with increases in occupancy and/or revenue, including management fees and franchise fees. Specifically, increases in indirect expenses were substantially related to our acquisition of the Hyde Resort in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for an increase of approximately $1.8 million for the period, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, there were increases in indirect expenses at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia of approximately $1.9 million in the aggregate. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $2.3 million following the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia and by decreases of indirect expenses at our properties in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Hollywood Beach, Florida, by approximately $1.5 million in the aggregate.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $2.0 million, or 13.2%, to approximately $17.0 million compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mostly attributable to increases in depreciation and amortization related to our renovated properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida in the amount of $2.2 million in the aggregate, and from our acquisition of the Hyde Resort property for approximately $0.1 million along with increases at all the remaining properties by approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate, offset by the reduction from our sold property in Hampton, Virginia by approximately $0.4 million.\nGain / Loss on Disposal of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.5 million, compared to a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The approximate $1.1 million increase in net loss on disposal of assets resulted mainly from the renovated properties in Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida. These hotels were also impacted by Hurricane Irma and realized a loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.4 million in the aggregate. These loss increases were offset by a gain on disposal of our Hampton, Virginia property by approximately $0.1 million and a one-time gain of approximately $0.1 million for defective materials.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $0.3 million, or 5.2%, to approximately $6.3 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in aborted offering costs of approximately $0.5 million, which was offset by reductions in accounting fees of approximately $0.1 million and legal fees of approximately $0.1 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $2.0 million, or 11.3%, to approximately $15.7 million compared to approximately $17.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was substantially related to the redemption of the 8% senior unsecured notes (the 8% Notes\u201d) in August of 2016 and the redemption of the 7% Notes in November of 2017, resulting in the aggregate reduction of approximately $1.6 million. We also reduced our Hampton, Virginia and Houston, Texas loans by approximately $9.0 million in the aggregate resulting in a reduction of interest by approximately $0.4 million.\nLoss on Early Debt Extinguishment. The loss on early debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 16.9%, to approximately $1.2 million compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we redeemed our 7% Notes which reflect the majority of the loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $1.0 million.\nUnrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. During August 2015, we purchased an interest rate cap for $179,800. As of December 31, 2017, the fair market value of the interest rate cap is $5,213 compared to the fair market value of $33,597, as of December 31, 2016. The unrealized loss on hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $28,384 and $37,384, respectively.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $2.2 million to approximately $2.2 million compared to gain on involuntary conversion of assets of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2016. During October 2016, Hurricane Matthew damaged real and personal property at our Hampton, Virginia and Savannah, Georgia properties, and we had a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $1.0 million. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma damaged real and personal property at our properties in Jacksonville, Florida and Tampa, Florida, resulting in a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $0.4 million. We experienced electrical damage to The Whitehall property that resulted in a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $0.8 million.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $3.1 million, or 227.1%, to approximately $1.7 million compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The income tax provision was primarily derived from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees realized a lower operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a lower income tax benefit. However, there was a one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate, due to the TCJA. At December 31, 2017, deferred tax assets total approximately $5.5 million, of which approximately $4.9 million relate to net operating losses of our TRS Lessee. At December 31, 2017, we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be available during the carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforward. We will continue to regularly evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.9 million, or 96.7%, to approximately $29.5 thousand compared to net income of approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the operating results discussed above.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately $3.8 million, compared to approximately $1.1 million distributions to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we accrued approximately $1.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as dividends on the preferred stock. These increases were due to the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock in October 2017.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following narrative discusses our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Activities. Our principal source of cash to meet our operating requirements, including distributions to unit holders of the Operating Partnership and holders of our preferred and common stock, as well as debt service (excluding debt maturities), is the operations of our hotels. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $26.2\nmillion. We expect that cash on hand and the net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund our operating requirements, monthly and quarterly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of a debt) and the payment of dividends (distributions) to the stockholders of the Company (the unitholders of the Operating Partnership) in accordance with federal income tax laws which require us to make annual distributions, as qualifying distributions,\u201d to the Company's stockholders of at least 90.0% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding its net capital gains, and reduced by certain non-cash items).\nInvesting Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we used approximately $79.7 million to acquire the Hyatt Centric Arlington, $22.1 million on capital expenditures, of which, approximately $5.7 million related to the routine replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and $11.5 million relating primarily to the renovations of our hotels in Wilmington, North Carolina, Hollywood, Florida and Tampa, Florida and, in addition, we acquired a parcel of land, which had previously been leased, and that constituted most of our available parking lot at our property in Raleigh, North Carolina for approximately $3.5 million. During the year we received approximately $0.9 million of insurance proceeds as involuntary conversions of assets, primarily at our Houston, Texas and Hollywood, Florida properties. The Operating Partnership received approximately $0.2 million in ESOP loan payments.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flow provided by financing activities of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $79.2 million for the Company and approximately $78.9 million for the Operating Partnership. This inflow principally consisted of mortgage proceeds of $175.8 million, proceeds from unsecured debt of $25.0 million and proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stock of approximately $1.6 million, offset by mortgage loan payments of approximately $107.2 million, dividend and distribution payments of approximately $12.1 for the Company and approximately $12.4 million for the Operating Partnership and payments of deferred financing costs of approximately $3.8 million.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company and the Operating Partnership closed on a sale and issuance by the Operating Partnership of an aggregate $25.0 million of the 7.25% Notes, unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, for net proceeds after all estimated expenses of approximately $23.3 million. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from this offering, together with existing cash on hand and $57.0 million of asset-level mortgage indebtedness, to finance the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington and for working capital.\nOn March 1, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement, a first and second promissory note ( Note A\u201d and Note B\u201d, respectively), and other loan documents, including a guarantee by the Operating Partnership, to secure an aggregate $57.0 million mortgage (the Mortgage Loan\u201d) on the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel with Fifth Third Bank. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note A was in the amount of $50.0 million; had a term of 3 years, with two 1-year extension options, each of which subject to certain criteria; bore a floating interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 3.00%; and amortized on a 25-year schedule. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note B was in the amount of $7.0 million; had a term of 1-year, with two 1-year extension options, each of which subject to certain criteria; bore a floating interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.00%; and required monthly principal payments of $100,000 during the initial 1-year term, $150,000 during the first 1-year extended term, and $250,000 during the second 1-year extended term, with interest payments due monthly on the outstanding principal amount during all three terms.\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement and other documents, including a promissory note, to secure a mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University with MetLife Commercial Mortgage Originator, LLC. The mortgage has an initial principal balance of $18.3 million, with an additional $5.2 million available upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The mortgage has an initial term of 4 years with a 1-year extension and bears a floating rate of interest equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 4.00%. The mortgage requires monthly interest-only payments and, following a 12-month lockout, can be prepaid with a penalty during its second year and without penalty thereafter. We entered into an interest-rate cap agreement to limit our exposure through August 1, 2022 to increases in LIBOR exceeding 3.25% on a notional amount of $23.5 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University, to pay closing costs and intend to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 31, 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the loan and security agreement; an amended, restated and consolidated mortgage loan note; and other related documents with its existing lender, TD Bank, N.A., to amend the terms of our mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. Concurrent with the loan modification, we also entered into a 5-year swap agreement with The Toronto-Dominion Bank. Pursuant to the amended loan documents: (i) the principal balance of the loan was increased from approximately $30.0 million to $42.2 million; (ii) the loan's maturity date was extended to July 31, 2023; (iii) the loan bears a floating interest rate equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 2.27% (the Loan Rate\u201d); (iv) the loan amortizes on a 30-year schedule with payments of principal and interest beginning immediately; (v) the loan can be prepaid without penalty; and (vi) the loan will no longer be fully guaranteed by the Operating Partnership, but the Operating Partnership has guaranteed certain standard bad boy\u201d carveouts. Pursuant to the swap agreement: (i) the Loan Rate has been swapped for a fixed interest rate of 5.237%; notional amounts of the swap approximate the declining balance of the loan; and (iii) we are responsible for any potential termination fees associated with early termination of the swap agreement. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full the existing Note B to\nthe mortgage loan on our Hyatt Centric Arlington and to pay closing costs associated with the amendment and used the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into a Sales Agency Agreement, with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ( Sandler O'Neill\u201d), under which the Company may sell from time to time through Sandler O'Neill, as sales agent, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $5.0 million and up to 400,000 shares of the Company's 7.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share. Through December 31, 2018, the Company sold 88,297 shares of common stock and 52,141 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for an aggregate net total of approximately $1.8 million. We used the proceeds for issuance costs and general corporate purposes.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement and other documents, including a promissory note, to secure a mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington with MetLife Real Estate Lending LLC. Pursuant to the loan documents, the Mortgage Loan has an initial principal balance of $50.0 million; has a term of 10 years; bears a fixed interest rate of 5.25%; amortizes on a 30-year schedule; and following a 5-year lockout, can be prepaid with penalty in years 6-10 and without penalty during the final 4 months of the term. The Company used the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington, to pay closing costs, and for general corporate purposes.\nThe following narrative discusses our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Activities. Our principal source of cash to meet our operating requirements, including distributions to unit holders of the Operating Partnership and holders of our preferred and common stock, as well as debt service (excluding debt maturities), is the operations of our hotels. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $15.8 million. We expect that cash on hand and the net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund our operating requirements, monthly and quarterly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of a debt) and the payment of dividends (distributions) to the stockholders of the Company (the unitholders of the Operating Partnership) in accordance with federal income tax laws which require us to make annual distributions, as qualifying distributions,\u201d to the Company's stockholders of at least 90.0% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding its net capital gains, and reduced by certain non-cash items).\nInvesting Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used approximately $4.0 million to acquire our interest in the Hyde Resort and Residences, $23.2 million on capital expenditures, of which, approximately $5.6 million related to the routine replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and $17.6 million related to the renovation of our hotels in Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida. The Operating Partnership made advances to the Company, net after periodic principal payments of approximately $4.7 million. We also received approximately $5.4 million from the sale of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Riverside and proceeds from insurance conversions of approximately $2.3 million.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flow provided by financing activities of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $0.5 million for the Company and approximately $5.2 million for the Operating Partnership. This inflow principally consisted of proceeds from mortgage loans of $40.5 million and the sale of preferred stock of approximately $30.5 million, offset by redemption of the 7% Notes for $25.3 million, payments on mortgage loans of approximately $26.0 million, repurchase of common stock for approximately $3.7 million, dividend and distribution payments of approximately $9.7 million, a loan by the Company to the ESOP of approximately $4.9 million and payments of deferred financing costs of approximately $0.8 million.\nOn June 29, 2017, we entered into a promissory note and other loan documents to secure a $35.5 million mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Pursuant to the loan documents, the loan has a maturity date of July 11, 2024, bears a fixed interest rate of 4.88%, amortizes on a 30-year schedule, and is subject to a prepayment premium following a prepayment lockout period. The Company used a portion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, to pay closing costs and for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Company closed a sale and issuance of 1,200,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock, for net proceeds after expenses of approximately $28.1 million. On October 17, 2017, the Company closed a sale and issuance of an additional 100,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of approximately $2.5 million, pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of an option granted by the Company to purchase additional shares. The Company contributed the net proceeds from the offering to its Operating Partnership for an equivalent number of Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the Series C Preferred Units\u201d). We used the net proceeds to redeem in full the Operating Partnership's 7.0% Notes and for working capital.\nOn November 15, 2017, the Operating Partnership redeemed the entire $25.3 million principal amount of its 7% Notes, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 7% Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe anticipate that our need for recurring capital expenditures for the replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment over the next 12 to 24 months will be at historical norms for our properties and the industry. Historically, we have aimed to maintain overall capital expenditures, except for those required by our franchisors as a condition to a franchise license or license renewal, at 4.0% of gross revenue. In addition, during fiscal year 2019 we expect total renovation capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 million related to our property in Tampa, Florida.\nWe expect capital expenditures for the recurring replacement or refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment at our properties will be funded by our replacement reserve accounts, other than costs that we incur to make capital improvements required by our franchisors. Reserve accounts are escrowed accounts with funds deposited monthly and reserved for capital improvements or expenditures with respect to all of our hotels. We currently deposit an amount equal to 4.0% of gross revenue for The DeSoto, the Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, The DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverside, the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University, The Whitehall and the Georgian Terrace as well as 4.0% of room revenues for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport on a monthly basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $37.9 million, of which approximately $4.1 million was in restricted reserve accounts for capital improvements, real estate tax and insurance escrows. We expect that our cash on hand combined with our cash flow from our hotels should be adequate to fund continuing operations, recurring capital expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of the indentures or mortgage debt).\nWe intend to continue to invest in hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. The success of our acquisition strategy depends, in part, on our ability to access additional capital through other sources. There can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity.\nWe expect to meet our liquidity requirements for hotel property acquisitions, property redevelopment, investments in new joint ventures and debt maturities, and the retirement of maturing mortgage debt, through net proceeds from additional issuances of common shares, additional issuances of preferred shares, issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, secured and unsecured borrowings, the selective disposition of non-core assets, and cash on hand. We remain committed to a flexible capital structure and strive to maintain prudent debt leverage.\nOther than monthly mortgage loan principal payments, our only mortgage debt obligation maturing in 2019 is the $18.3 million mortgage on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore, which may be extended for two additional 1-year periods subject to certain terms and conditions. We have approximately $33.2 million in debt obligations maturing in 2021, which reflects the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, accounting for reductions for future monthly principal payments, and maturity of the 7.25% Notes.\nOn June 1, 2017, we entered into an agreement to purchase the commercial unit of the planned Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, a condominium hotel under development in Hollywood, Florida, for a price of $5.1 million from 4000 South Ocean Property Owner, LLLP. In connection with the agreement, we also entered into a pre-opening services agreement whereby the seller has agreed to pay the Company approximately $0.8 million in connection with certain pre-opening activities to be undertaken prior to the closing. The Company has agreed to purchase inventories at closing consistent with the management and operation of the hotel and the related condominium association for an additional amount and has further agreed to enter into a lease agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the hotel; and to enter into a management agreement relating to the operation and management of the hotel's condominium association. The Company anticipates that the closing of the transaction and the execution of related agreements will take place by the end of 2019, once construction of the hotel has been substantially completed. The closing of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions as described in the purchase agreement.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company and the Operating Partnership closed on a sale and issuance by the Operating Partnership of an aggregate $25.0 million of the 7.25% Notes, unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, for net proceeds after all estimated expenses of approximately $23.3 million. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from this offering, together with existing cash on hand and $57.0 million of asset-level mortgage indebtedness, to finance the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington and for working capital.\nOn March 1, 2018, we acquired the 318-room Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel located in Arlington, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.7 million, including seller credits. On March 1, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement, a first and second promissory note ( Note A\u201d and Note B\u201d, respectively), and other loan documents, including a guarantee by the Operating\nPartnership, to secure an aggregate $57.0 million mortgage (the Mortgage Loan\u201d) on the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel with Fifth Third Bank. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note A was in the amount of $50.0 million; had a term of 3 years, with two 1-year extension options, each of which subject to certain criteria; bore a floating interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 3.00%; and amortized on a 25-year schedule. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note B was in the amount of $7.0 million; had a term of 1-year, with two 1-year extension options, each of which subject to certain criteria; bore a floating interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.00%; and required monthly principal payments of $100,000 during the initial 1-year term, $150,000 during the first 1-year extended term, and $250,000 during the second 1-year extended term, with interest payments due monthly on the outstanding principal amount during all three terms. The full amount of the loan proceeds, together with proceeds of the 7.25% Notes offering and cash on hand, were used to finance the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington.\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement and other documents, including a promissory note, to secure a mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University with MetLife Commercial Mortgage Originator, LLC. The mortgage has an initial principal balance of $18.3 million, with an additional $5.2 million available upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The mortgage has an initial term of 4 years with a 1-year extension and bears a floating rate of interest equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 4.00%. The mortgage requires monthly interest-only payments and, following a 12-month lockout, can be prepaid with a penalty during its second year and without penalty thereafter. We entered into an interest-rate cap agreement to limit our exposure through August 1, 2022 to increases in LIBOR exceeding 3.25% on a notional amount of $23.5 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University, to pay closing costs and intend to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 31, 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the loan and security agreement; an amended, restated and consolidated mortgage loan note; and other related documents with its existing lender, TD Bank, N.A., to amend the terms of our mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. Concurrent with the loan modification, we also entered into a 5-year swap agreement with The Toronto-Dominion Bank. Pursuant to the amended loan documents: (i) the principal balance of the loan was increased from approximately $30.0 million to $42.2 million; (ii) the loan's maturity date was extended to July 31, 2023; (iii) the loan bears a floating interest rate equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 2.27% (the Loan Rate\u201d); (iv) the loan amortizes on a 30-year schedule with payments of principal and interest beginning immediately; (v) the loan can be prepaid without penalty; and (vi) the loan will no longer be fully guaranteed by the Operating Partnership, but the Operating Partnership has guaranteed certain standard bad boy\u201d carveouts. Pursuant to the swap agreement: (i) the Loan Rate has been swapped for a fixed interest rate of 5.237%; notional amounts of the swap approximate the declining balance of the loan; and (iii) we are responsible for any potential termination fees associated with early termination of the swap agreement. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full the existing Note B to the mortgage loan on our Hyatt Centric Arlington and to pay closing costs associated with the amendment and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into a Sales Agency Agreement, with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ( Sandler O'Neill\u201d), under which the Company may sell from time to time through Sandler O'Neill, as sales agent, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $5.0 million and up to 400,000 shares of the Company's 7.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share. Through December 31, 2018, the Company sold 88,297 shares of common stock and 52,141 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for an aggregate net total of approximately $1.8 million. We used the proceeds to pay issuance costs and for general corporate purposes.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into a loan agreement and other documents, including a promissory note, to secure a mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington with MetLife Real Estate Lending LLC. Pursuant to the loan documents, the Mortgage Loan has an initial principal balance of $50.0 million; has a term of 10 years; bears a fixed interest rate of 5.25%; amortizes on a 30-year schedule; and following a 5-year lockout, can be prepaid with penalty in years 6-10 and without penalty during the final 4 months of the term. The Company used the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington, to pay closing costs, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the extension of the Company's stock repurchase program, under which the Company may purchase up to $10.0 million of its outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at prevailing prices on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, at the discretion of management. The Company's stock repurchase program was originally announced in December 2016 and was extended on the same terms. The Company expects to use available working capital to fund purchases under the stock repurchase program and intends to complete the repurchase program prior to December 31, 2019, unless extended by the Board of Directors. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased zero, 401,720 and 481,100 shares of common stock, respectively, for approximately $0.0 million, $2.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The repurchased shares have been returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.\nFinancial Covenants\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, general economic conditions and disruption caused by renovation activity or major weather disturbances.\nIf we violate the financial covenants contained in these agreements, we may attempt to negotiate waivers of the violations or amend the terms of the applicable mortgage loan agreement with the lender; however, we can make no assurance that we would be successful in any such negotiation or that, if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments, such waivers or amendments would be on attractive terms. Some mortgage loan agreements provide alternate cure provisions which may allow us to otherwise comply with the financial covenants by obtaining an appraisal of the hotel, prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or by providing cash collateral until such time as the financial covenants are met by the collateralized property without consideration of the cash collateral. Alternate cure provisions which include prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or providing cash collateral may have a material impact on our liquidity.\nIf we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment or satisfy alternate cure provisions, if any, or unable to meet any alternate cure requirements and a default were to occur, we would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing, private or public offerings of debt securities, or additional equity financing.\nUnder the terms of our non-recourse secured mortgage loan agreements, failure to comply with the financial covenants in the loan agreement triggers cash flows from the property to be directed to the lender, which may limit our overall liquidity as that cash flow would not be available to us.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, current on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under any of our mortgage loans, with the exception of the mortgage on Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore. At December 31, 2018, we failed to meet the Debt Service Coverage Ratio ( DSCR\u201d) covenant under the mortgage on Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore. We are currently in discussions with the existing lender to modify or refinance the mortgage on similar terms, with an extension of the maturity date and a reduced DSCR requirement. Notwithstanding the modification discussions, the existing loan agreement contains a balancing provision that allows us to either pay down the principal balance of the loan or offer cash collateral sufficient to meet the DSCR requirement. We anticipate that a payment to the lender of approximately $1.9 million would be required to bring us into compliance under the DSCR requirement pursuant to that balancing provision of the loan agreement.\nUnsecured Notes\nThe indenture for the 7.25% Notes, issued on February 12, 2018, contains certain covenants and restrictions that require us to meet certain financial ratios. We are not permitted to incur any Debt (other than Intercompany Debt), each as defined in the indenture, if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and to the application of the proceeds thereof, the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt to Adjusted Total Asset Value, as defined in the indenture, would be greater than 0.65 to 1.0. In addition, we are not permitted to incur any Debt if the ratio of Stabilized Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to Stabilized Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined in the indenture, on the date on which such additional Debt is to be incurred, on a pro-forma basis, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and to the application of the proceeds thereof, would be less than 1.50 to 1.0.\nThese financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are presented below for the sole purpose of evaluating our compliance with the key financial covenants of our 7.25% Notes as they were or would have been applicable at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 184: <table></table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December

The tax indemnity agreements expired on or about December 22, 2014. Our obligations under the contribution agreements may effectively preclude us from reducing our consolidated indebtedness below approximately $11.0 million.\nDistributions to Stockholders and Holders of Units in the Operating Partnership. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2004. To maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, (excluding net capital gain, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). The Company's ability to pay distributions to its stockholders will depend, in part, upon its receipt of distributions from the Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from our TRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel manager. Distributions to the Company's stockholders will generally be taxable to the Company's stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our investments will be equity ownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and non-cash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining the Company's REIT status, our TRS Lessees may retain any after-tax earnings.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders and Holder of Preferred partnership units in the Operating Partnership. The Company is obligated to pay distributions to its holders of the Company's preferred stock and the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay its preferred unit holder, the Company. Holders of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive distributions when authorized by the Company's board of directors out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions. The amount of annual dividends on our outstanding preferred shares is approximately $5.8 million and the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to our outstanding preferred shares is approximately $74.1 million. The preferred stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the Company or its affiliates, except in the event of a change of control.\nThe Company's ability to pay distributions to its stockholders will depend, in part, upon its receipt of distributions from the Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from our TRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel managers. Distributions to the Company's stockholders will generally be taxable to the Company's stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our investments will be equity ownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and non-cash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining the Company's REIT status, our TRS Lessees may retain any after-tax earnings.\nThe amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by the Company's board of directors and declared by the Company based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by its directors, and no assurance can be given that the distribution policy will not change in the future.\nInflation\nWe generate revenues primarily from lease payments from our TRS Lessees and net income from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Therefore, we rely primarily on the performance of the individual properties and the ability of the management company to increase revenues and to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to keep pace with inflation. However, competitive pressures at some or all of our hotels may limit the ability of the management company to raise room rates.\nOur expenses, including hotel operating expenses, administrative expenses, real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance are subject to inflation. These expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation, except for energy, liability insurance, property and casualty insurance, property tax rates, employee benefits, and some wages, which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation.\nGeographic Concentration and Seasonality\nOur hotels are located in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in these geographic areas, including industry downturns, relocation of businesses and any oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand. Adverse economic developments in the markets in which we have a concentration of hotels, or in any of the other markets in which we operate, or any increase in hotel supply or decrease in lodging demand resulting from the local, regional or national business climate, could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe operations of our hotel properties have historically been seasonal. The months of April and May are traditionally strong, as is October. The periods from mid-November through mid-February are traditionally slow with the exception of hotels located in certain markets, namely Florida and Texas, which experience significant room demand during this period.\nCompetition\nThe hotel industry is highly competitive with various participants competing on the basis of price, level of service and geographic location. Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties. The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or at hotel properties acquired in the future. We believe that brand recognition, location, the quality of the hotel, consistency of services provided, and price, are the principal competitive factors affecting our hotels.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe critical accounting policies are described below. We consider these policies critical because they involve difficult management judgments and assumptions, are subject to material change from external factors or are pervasive and are significant to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results.\nInvestment in Hotel Properties. Hotel properties are stated at cost, net of any impairment charges, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 7-39 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for furniture and equipment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the controlling interests in hotels comprising our accounting predecessor, MHI Hotels Services Group, and noncontrolling interests held by the controlling holders of our accounting predecessor in hotels, which were acquired from third parties contributed to us in connection with the Company's initial public offering, are recorded at historical cost basis. Noncontrolling interests in those entities that comprise our accounting predecessor and the interests in hotels, other than those held by the controlling members of our accounting predecessor, acquired from third parties are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition.\nWe review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include, but are not limited to, adverse permanent changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs a recoverability analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities and the estimated proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the hotel property, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the related hotel property's estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized.\nIn performing the recoverability analysis, we project future operating cash flows based upon significant assumptions regarding growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and future capital expenditures required to maintain the hotel in its current operating condition. We also project cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel based upon various factors including property-specific capitalization rates, ratio of selling price to gross hotel revenues and the selling price per room.\nRevenue Recognition. Hotel revenues, including room, food, beverage and other hotel revenues, are recognized as the related services are delivered. We generally consider accounts receivable to be fully collectible; accordingly, no allowance for doubtful accounts is required. If we determine that amounts are uncollectible, which would generally be the result of a customer's bankruptcy or other economic downturn, such amounts will be charged against operations when that determination is made.\nIncome Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Because of expected future taxable income of our TRS Lessee, we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2018. We regularly evaluate the likelihood that our TRS Lessee will be able to realize its deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2018, we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be available during the carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforward. A number of factors played a critical role in this determination, including:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a demonstrated track record of past profitability and utilization of past NOL carryforwards,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reasonable forecasts of future taxable income, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> anticipated changes in the lease rental payments from the TRS Lessee to subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShould unanticipated adverse financial trends occur, or other negative evidence develop, a valuation allowance may be necessary in the future against some or all of our deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements, please refer to the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders, Adjusted FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders and Hotel EBITDA, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to be key supplemental measures of our performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our performance. These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) or amounts available for our discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP.\nFFO and Adjusted FFO. Industry analysts and investors use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself.\nWe consider FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs.\nWe further adjust FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT's definition of FFO, including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments or warrant derivative, loan impairment losses, losses on early extinguishment of debt, aborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, over-assessed real estate taxes on appeal, change in control gains or losses and acquisition transaction costs. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of Adjusted FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss Available to the Common\nStockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,719,978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,339,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (218,173\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Net Loss Attributable to the\nNoncontrolling Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (718,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (413,014\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,884,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,999,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,019,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on Sale or Disposal of Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 511,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,413,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 365,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (917,767\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,242,876\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,040,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,418,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,139,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease (Increase) in Deferred Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 319,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,498,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,558,966\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan Modification Fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized Loss on Hedging Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 808,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on Aborted Offering Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 541,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 753,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,178,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,417,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,922,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,664,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,100,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHotel EBITDA. We define Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) equity in the income or loss of equity investees, (5) unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (6) gains and losses on disposal of assets, (7) realized gains and losses on investments, (8) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (9) loss on early debt extinguishment, (10) gains or losses on change in control, (11) corporate general and administrative expense, (12) depreciation and amortization, (13) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets (14) distributions to preferred stockholders and (15) other operating revenue not related to our wholly-owned portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nOur calculation of Hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net loss to Hotel EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss Available to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,719,978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,339,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (218,173\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Net Loss Attributable to the\nNoncontrolling Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (718,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (413,014\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,953,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,727,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,735,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (352,951\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (218,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (115,785\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions to Preferred Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,829,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,781,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,144,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Tax Provision (Benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 469,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,737,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,367,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,884,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,999,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,019,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized Loss on Hedging Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 808,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on Debt Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 753,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,178,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,417,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on Sale or Disposal of Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 511,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,413,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 365,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (917,767\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,242,876\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate General and Administrative Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,180,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,335,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,021,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,683,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,989,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,012,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a lodging Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) specializing in upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue opportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. Since January 1, 2016, we have completed the following acquisitions and dispositions:\n \u2022 On January 30, 2017, we acquired the hotel commercial unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences, a 400-unit condominium-hotel located in the Hollywood, Florida market. \n \u2022 On February 7, 2017, we closed on the sale of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina. \n \u2022 On March 1, 2018, we acquired the 318-room Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel located in Arlington, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.7 million, including seller credits. The Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel is subject to a long-term ground lease agreement that covers all of the land underlying the hotel. \nAs of December 31, 2018, our hotel portfolio consisted of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels with 3,156 rooms, nine of which operate under well-known brands such as Hilton, Crowne Plaza, DoubleTree, Hyatt and Sheraton, and three of which are independent hotels, and the hotel commercial condominium unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of the following hotel properties:\n\n (1) Operated as an independent hotel. \n (2) We own the hotel commercial unit and operate a rental program. Reflects only those condominium units that were participating in the rental program as of December 31, 2018. At any given time, some portion of the units participating in our rental program may be occupied by the unit owner(s) and unavailable for rental to hotel guests. We sometimes refer to each participating condominium unit as a room\u201d. \nWe conduct substantially all our business through the Operating Partnership, Sotherly Hotels LP. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns an approximate 88.9% interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were contributors of our initial hotel properties and related assets.\nTo qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which then engage hotel management companies to operate the hotels under a management agreement. Our TRS Lessees have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality and Highgate Hotels to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., are\nconsolidated into each of our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. are subject to taxation similar to other C corporations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues:\n \u2022 Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available; \n \u2022 Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and \n \u2022 Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms. \nRevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, credit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel's restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy.\nWe also use FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our wholly-owned hotels and the Hyde Resort & Residences, during each respective reporting period ( composite portfolio\u201d properties), as well as the key operating metrics for the eleven wholly-owned properties that were under our control during all of 2018 ( same-store\u201d properties). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, which was sold in February 2017, the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which was acquired in February 2018 and the Hyde Resort & Residences, which was acquired in January 2017.\n\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $178.2 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million, or 15.5%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $154.3 million. The increase in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased revenues by approximately $18.1 million. In addition, our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, which started operations on January 30, 2017, has continued to ramp up and accounted for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period. There was also a net aggregate increase in revenues of approximately $3.1 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $15.3 million, or 14.4%, to approximately $121.0 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $105.7 million. The increase in room revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased room revenues by approximately $14.8 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in room revenues of approximately $0.5 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.6 million, or 10.5%, to approximately $38.1 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased food and beverage revenues by approximately $2.3 million. There was also a net increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $1.3 million; resulting from increases of\napproximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland and an aggregate increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $0.4 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.0 million, or 35.8 %, to approximately $19.0 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $14.0 million. The increase in revenue from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the continued ramp up of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased other operating departments revenues by approximately $1.0 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $17.2 million, or 15.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately $130.5 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $113.3 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased hotel operating expenses by approximately $12.7 million. Our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel also accounted for an increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $1.9 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $2.6 million for the period from our remaining properties.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.6 million, or 13.7%, to approximately $30.3 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase in rooms expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased room expenses by approximately $3.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in room expenses of approximately $0.4 million for the period, from the remaining properties.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.5 million, or 14.3%, to approximately $28.1 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was a net aggregate increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulting from; increases of approximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland; from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased food and beverage expenses by approximately $2.0 million from a net increase in food and beverage expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the period at the remaining properties.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $2.0 million, or 45.7%, to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in expense from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, accounted for an increase of approximately $1.0 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments expenses of approximately $1.0 million for the twelve-month period, from the remaining properties.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $8.0 million, or 13.9%, to approximately $65.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales and marketing costs, franchise fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, management fees, real and personal property taxes as well as general and administrative costs at the property level are included in indirect expenses. The increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased indirect costs by approximately $7.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in indirect expenses of approximately $0.8 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.9 million, or 22.9 %, to approximately $20.9 million compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was mostly attributable to increases in the depreciation related to our properties being renovated in Wilmington, North Carolina and Tampa, Florida, that accounted for increases of approximately $1.3 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased depreciation by approximately $2.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.4 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nGain / Loss on Disposal of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $0.5 million, compared to a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 2.4%, to approximately $6.2 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to reduced legal costs of approximately $0.1 million and the absence of aborted offering costs for 2018 as compared to aborted offering costs of approximately $0.5 million for 2017, which were offset by increased salaries by approximately $0.2 million, increased audit fees by approximately $0.1 million and increases in other costs by approximately $0.1 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $4.2 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $19.9 million compared to approximately $15.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was substantially related to the new mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington and deferred financing costs associated with the mortgage on that property accounting for an increase of approximately $2.4 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. There was also a net aggregate increase of approximately $1.6 million of interest expenses with increases on mortgages for Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida and Houston Texas, which was offset by decreases on mortgages for Laurel, Maryland; Hollywood, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, there was an increase in unsecured note interest for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $0.2 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Early Debt Extinguishment. The loss on early debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 36.1%, to approximately $0.8 million compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we refinanced the mortgage loans we had on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University, the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington with an approximate aggregate loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $0.8 million.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan we had with Bank of the Ozarks on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, with a new fixed rate loan from Bank of America. The amount of accumulated un-amortized loan costs of approximately $0.2 million was written off and we redeemed our 7% Notes which reflect the majority of the loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $1.0 million.\nUnrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. During July 2018, we purchased an interest rate cap for $204,756 and we purchased an interest rate SWAP liability for $294,176. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate caps was $94,697 compared to the fair market value of $5,213, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate SWAP was a liability of $984,677. The unrealized loss on hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $808,958 and $28,384, respectively.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.3 million to approximately $0.9 million compared to gain on involuntary conversion of assets of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, we experienced electrical damage to The Whitehall property that resulted in a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $0.6 million, which was realized in the first quarter of 2018, and damage to the DoubleTree by Hilton Hollywood Beach Resort property for approximately $0.3 million.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.2 million, or 73.0%, to approximately $0.5 million compared to an income tax provision of approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax provision was primarily derived from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees realized a net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in an income tax provision instead of an income tax benefit. However, at December 31, 2017 there was a one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate, due to the TCJA. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred tax assets total approximately $5.1 and $5.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $4.4 and $4.9 million, respectively, relate to net operating losses of our TRS Lessee. At December 31, 2018, we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be available during the carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforward. We will continue to regularly evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets.\nNet (Loss) Income. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $0.6 million, or 2,162.3%, to approximately $(0.6) million compared to net income of approximately $29.5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the operating results discussed above.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded distributions to preferred stockholders of approximately $5.8 million, compared to approximately $3.8 million distributions to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we accrued approximately $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, as dividends on the preferred stock. These increases were due to the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock in September 2018.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for our wholly-owned hotels and the Hyde Resort & Residences during each respective reporting period ( composite portfolio\u201d properties) as well as the key operating metrics for the eleven wholly-owned properties that were under our control during all of 2016 ( same-store\u201d properties). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance of the Hyde Resort & Residences, which was acquired on January 30, 2017.\n\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $154.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 0.9%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $152.8 million. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from management fees earned at the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, which commenced operations on January 30, 2017, accounting for an increase of approximately $4.0 million for the period and by increases in revenues of approximately $4.7 million for the period at our properties in Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. These increases in revenue were offset by the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $4.8 million; the impact of renovation activities at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida which had reduced revenues of approximately $1.2 million in the aggregate; and by decreases in revenue realized by our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Jeffersonville, Indiana of approximately $1.3 million in the aggregate.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $2.5 million, or 2.3%, to approximately $105.7 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $108.2 million. The decrease in room revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $3.2 million. In addition, our properties impacted by renovation activities in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Hollywood Beach, Florida had reduced revenues of approximately $2.2 million in the aggregate. Room revenue decreases of approximately $1.3 million in the aggregate were also realized by our properties in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Jeffersonville, Indiana. These decreases in room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were offset by room revenue increases of approximately $4.2 million in the aggregate at our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, which on a combined basis reflected a 1.7% decrease in occupancy, as compared to the same period in 2016.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.9 million, or 2.5%, to approximately $34.5 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in food and beverage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulted mainly from the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia which reduced revenues by approximately $1.4 million. Food and beverage revenue decreases of approximately $0.7 million were also realized by our properties in Raleigh, North Carolina; Jeffersonville, Indiana; Tampa, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. These decreases were offset by an increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $1.2 million at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Hollywood Beach, Florida and Houston, Texas.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $4.8 million, or 51.4%, to approximately $14.0 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $9.3 million. The increase in revenue from other operating departments for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the start of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase of approximately $4.0 million for the period and $0.3 million received by the Hollywood Beach, Florida property for construction interruption payments relating to the construction of a new building next to the property.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $0.4 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended December\n31, 2017 to approximately $113.3 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $112.8 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was substantially related to the start of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase in expenses of approximately $4.3 million for the period, which was offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $4.6 million after the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia. This net decrease of approximately $0.3 million was offset by a net increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $0.7 million for the period at all of our other properties.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $1.6 million, or 5.7%, to approximately $26.7 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After a $0.6 million reclassification reduced rooms expenses and increased indirect costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, the remaining decrease in rooms expense, resulted mainly from a decrease in expenses of approximately $1.3 million following the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia. In addition, rooms expenses decreased by approximately $0.9 million in the aggregate at our properties in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Hollywood Beach, Florida; Jeffersonville, Indiana and Tampa, Florida, which were offset by increases at our properties in Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia by approximately $0.6 million in the aggregate.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $0.2 million, or 0.9%, to approximately $24.6 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in food and beverage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was substantially related to increases for food and beverage expenses of approximately $1.7 million in the aggregate at our properties in Savannah, Georgia; Laurel, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Hollywood Beach, Florida and Houston, Texas, offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $1.1 million following the sale of our property in Hampton, Virginia along with decreases of approximately $0.4 million in the aggregate at our remaining properties.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $2.0 million, or 80.6%, to approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expense from other operating departments for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted mainly from the acquired interest and new operations in Hollywood Beach, Florida, accounting for an increase of approximately $2.5 million for the period, offset by a net decrease of approximately $0.5 million at our other properties.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.2%, to approximately $57.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales and marketing costs, franchise fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, management fees, real and personal property taxes as well as general and administrative costs at the property level are included in indirect expenses. After a $0.6 million reclassification reduced rooms expenses and increased indirect costs during the year ended December 31, 2016,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue opportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. Since January 1, 2016, we have completed the following acquisitions and dispositions:\n \u2022 On January 30, 2017, we acquired the hotel commercial unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences, a 400-unit condominium-hotel located in the Hollywood, Florida market. \n \u2022 On February 7, 2017, we closed on the sale of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina. \n \u2022 On March 1, 2018, we acquired the 318-room Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel located in Arlington, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.7 million, including seller credits. The Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel is subject to a long-term ground lease agreement that covers all of the land underlying the hotel. \nAs of December 31, 2018, our hotel portfolio consisted of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels with 3,156 rooms, nine of which operate under well-known brands such as Hilton, Crowne Plaza, DoubleTree, Hyatt and Sheraton, and three of which are independent hotels, and the hotel commercial condominium unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of the following hotel properties:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> of Rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Date of Acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Chain/Class Designation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholly-owned Hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tampa, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 29, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The DeSoto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Savannah, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 21, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upper Upscale(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jacksonville, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 22, 2005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Laurel, MD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 21, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Philadelphia, PA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 21, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Raleigh, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 21, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hollywood, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 9, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Georgian Terrace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Atlanta, GA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 27, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upper Upscale(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Wilmington, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 21, 2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hyatt Centric Arlington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Arlington, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upper Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sheraton Louisville Riverside\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jeffersonville, IN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 20, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upper Upscale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Whitehall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Houston, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 13, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Upper Upscale(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel Rooms Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Condominium Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hyde Resort & Residences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Hollywood, FL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Luxury(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Hotel & Participating Condominium Hotel Rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Operated as an independent hotel. \n (2) We own the hotel commercial unit and operate a rental program. Reflects only those condominium units that were participating in the rental program as of December 31, 2018. At any given time, some portion of the units participating in our rental program may be occupied by the unit owner(s) and unavailable for rental to hotel guests. We sometimes refer to each participating condominium unit as a room\u201d. \nWe conduct substantially all our business through the Operating Partnership, Sotherly Hotels LP. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns an approximate 88.9% interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were contributors of our initial hotel properties and related assets.\nTo qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which then engage hotel management companies to operate the hotels under a management agreement. Our TRS Lessees have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality and Highgate Hotels to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., are\nconsolidated into each of our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. are subject to taxation similar to other C corporations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues:\n \u2022 Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available; \n \u2022 Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and \n \u2022 Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms. \nRevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, credit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel's restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy.\nWe also use FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our wholly-owned hotels and the Hyde Resort & Residences, during each respective reporting period ( composite portfolio\u201d properties), as well as the key operating metrics for the eleven wholly-owned properties that were under our control during all of 2018 ( same-store\u201d properties). Accordingly, the same-store data does not reflect the performance of the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina, which was sold in February 2017, the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which was acquired in February 2018 and the Hyde Resort & Residences, which was acquired in January 2017.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Same-Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $178.2 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million, or 15.5%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $154.3 million. The increase in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased revenues by approximately $18.1 million. In addition, our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, which started operations on January 30, 2017, has continued to ramp up and accounted for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period. There was also a net aggregate increase in revenues of approximately $3.1 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $15.3 million, or 14.4%, to approximately $121.0 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $105.7 million. The increase in room revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased room revenues by approximately $14.8 million.

The increase in food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased food and beverage revenues by approximately $2.3 million. There was also a net increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $1.3 million; resulting from increases of\napproximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland and an aggregate increase in food and beverage revenues of approximately $0.4 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.0 million, or 35.8 %, to approximately $19.0 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $14.0 million. The increase in revenue from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the continued ramp up of operations at the Hyde Resort & Residences, accounting for an increase of approximately $2.7 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, on March 1, 2018, which increased other operating departments revenues by approximately $1.0 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the period from the remaining properties.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $17.2 million, or 15.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately $130.5 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $113.3 million. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased hotel operating expenses by approximately $12.7 million. Our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel also accounted for an increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $1.9 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in hotel operating expenses of approximately $2.6 million for the period from our remaining properties.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.6 million, or 13.7%, to approximately $30.3 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase in rooms expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased room expenses by approximately $3.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in room expenses of approximately $0.4 million for the period, from the remaining properties.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.5 million, or 14.3%, to approximately $28.1 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was a net aggregate increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulting from; increases of approximately $0.9 million at our properties with newly renovated restaurants in Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and Laurel, Maryland; from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased food and beverage expenses by approximately $2.0 million from a net increase in food and beverage expenses of approximately $0.6 million for the period at the remaining properties.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $2.0 million, or 45.7%, to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in expense from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from our interest in the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, accounted for an increase of approximately $1.0 million for the period. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in other operating departments expenses of approximately $1.0 million for the twelve-month period, from the remaining properties.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $8.0 million, or 13.9%, to approximately $65.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales and marketing costs, franchise fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, management fees, real and personal property taxes as well as general and administrative costs at the property level are included in indirect expenses. The increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased indirect costs by approximately $7.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in indirect expenses of approximately $0.8 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $3.9 million, or 22.9 %, to approximately $20.9 million compared to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was mostly attributable to increases in the depreciation related to our properties being renovated in Wilmington, North Carolina and Tampa, Florida, that accounted for increases of approximately $1.3 million for the period and from the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which increased depreciation by approximately $2.2 million. In addition, there was a net aggregate increase in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.4 million for this twelve-month period from the remaining properties.\nGain / Loss on Disposal of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $0.5 million, compared to a net loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 2.4%, to approximately $6.2 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was mainly due to reduced legal costs of approximately $0.1 million and the absence of aborted offering costs for 2018 as compared to aborted offering costs of approximately $0.5 million for 2017, which were offset by increased salaries by approximately $0.2 million, increased audit fees by approximately $0.1 million and increases in other costs by approximately $0.1 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $4.2 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $19.9 million compared to approximately $15.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was substantially related to the new mortgage on the Hyatt Centric Arlington and deferred financing costs associated with the mortgage on that property accounting for an increase of approximately $2.4 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. There was also a net aggregate increase of approximately $1.6 million of interest expenses with increases on mortgages for Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Jacksonville, Florida; Tampa, Florida and Houston Texas, which was offset by decreases on mortgages for Laurel, Maryland; Hollywood, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, there was an increase in unsecured note interest for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $0.2 million, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss on Early Debt Extinguishment. The loss on early debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 36.1%, to approximately $0.8 million compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we refinanced the mortgage loans we had on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University, the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington with an approximate aggregate loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $0.8 million.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan we had with Bank of the Ozarks on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, with a new fixed rate loan from Bank of America. The amount of accumulated un-amortized loan costs of approximately $0.2 million was written off and we redeemed our 7% Notes which reflect the majority of the loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately $1.0 million.\nUnrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. During July 2018, we purchased an interest rate cap for $204,756 and we purchased an interest rate SWAP liability for $294,176. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate caps was $94,697 compared to the fair market value of $5,213, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the interest rate SWAP was a liability of $984,677. The unrealized loss on hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $808,958 and $28,384, respectively.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.3 million to approximately $0.9 million compared to gain on involuntary conversion of assets of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, we experienced electrical damage to The Whitehall property that resulted in a one-time involuntary conversion in the amount of approximately $0.6 million, which was realized in the first quarter of 2018, and damage to the DoubleTree by Hilton Hollywood Beach Resort property for approximately $0.3 million.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $1.2 million, or 73.0%, to approximately $0.5 million compared to an income tax provision of approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax provision was primarily derived from the operations of our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees realized a net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in an income tax provision instead of an income tax benefit. However, at December 31, 2017 there was a one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate, due to the TCJA. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred tax assets total approximately $5.1 and $5.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $4.4 and $4.9 million, respectively, relate to net operating losses of our TRS Lessee. At December 31, 2018, we determined, based on all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be available during the carryforward periods to absorb all of the consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforward.
