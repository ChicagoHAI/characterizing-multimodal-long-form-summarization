Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 is included in Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 4, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2019, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising and screen rental revenue and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as the Metropolitan Opera, concert events, in-theatre gaming, live and pre-recorded sports programs and other special events in our theatres through Fathom Entertainment (operated by AC JV, LLC). National Cinemedia ( NCM\u201d) provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in-theatre advertising. Our Flix Media subsidiaries provide screen advertising and alternative content for our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2019 included Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, Frozen 2,The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel, SpiderMan: Far from Home, Aladdin, Joker, It: Chapter Two, Us, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, and Jumanji: The Next Level, among other films.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2020 include Bad Boys for Life, Onward, A Quiet Place: Part 2, Mulan, No Time to Die, Black Widow, Fast & Furious 9, Wonder Woman 1984, Soul, Top Gun: Maverick, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Jungle Cruise, The King's Man, The Eternals and Raya and the Last Dragon, among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. The Company also receives virtual print fees from studios for certain of its international locations, which are included as a contra-expense in film rentals and advertising costs; however, these costs are expected to be fully recovered in 2020. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and remodeled theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages tend to move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In certain locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease\nexpense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, credit card fees, third party ticket sales commissions, repairs and maintenance expenses, security services and expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which outlines how an entity should recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nOur patrons have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when products are sold to the consumer. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and screen rental revenues, promotional income, studio trailer placements and transactional fees. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as deferred revenues. Deferred revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as deferred revenues and record admissions revenues when the showtime for a movie ticket purchased with a credit has passed. We have loyalty programs in the U.S. and many of our international locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as deferred revenues based on the number of reward points issued to customers and we recognize the deferred revenues when the customer redeems such points. The value of loyalty points issued is based on the estimated fair value of the rewards offered. The Company records breakage revenue on gift cards and discount ticket vouchers generally based on redemption activity and historical experience with unused balances. The Company records breakage revenue upon the expiration of loyalty points and subscription credits. Breakage revenue is recorded as other revenues on the consolidated income statements. Advances collected on concession and other contracts are deferred and recognized during the period in which we satisfy the related performance obligations, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected. These advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as we meet our performance obligations in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\nFilm rental costs are subject to the film licensing arrangement and accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either; 1) a sliding scale formula, which is generally established prior to the opening of the film, 2) firm terms or 3) estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film for its full run. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when the initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.\nOur advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASC Topic 842\u201d). The purpose of ASC Topic 842 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. We adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and elected certain practical expedients. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> actual theatre level cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> budgeted theatre level cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> theatre property and equipment carrying values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> operating lease right-of-use asset carrying values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amortizing intangible asset carrying values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the age of a recently built theatre;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competitive theatres in the marketplace;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of recent ticket price changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> available lease renewal options; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties, and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment includes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. We performed a qualitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If\nthe estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we performed qualitative tradename impairment analyses. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments\u201d below.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units\nunder the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We elected the following practical expedients, as allowed by ASC Topic 842:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We chose not to separate nonlease components from lease components, accounting for lease components and nonlease components associated with a lease as a single lease component.

The as reported increase was primarily due to increased commissions related to expanded screen advertising\nrevenues and third party ticket sales commissions and credit card fees, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $170.8 million for 2019 from $162.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation and increased cloud-based software costs, which were partially offset by decreased legal fees and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $261.2 million for 2019 and 2018. The increase related to theatre remodels and new theatres was offset by a $13.4 million impact from the adoption of ASC Topic 842 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $57.0 million for 2019 compared to $32.4 million for 2018. Impairment charges for 2019 consisted of theatre properties in seven countries and impairment charges for 2018 consisted of theatre properties in five countries. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were for certain new concept theatres being developed and tested by us and other theatres that were individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on disposal of assets and other of $12.0 million during 2019 compared to $38.7 million during 2018. Activity for 2019 was primarily due to the retirement of assets related to theatre remodels. Activity for 2018 was primarily due to the retirement of assets related to theatre remodels and the accrual of reserves for pending litigation (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $100.0 million for 2019 compared to $110.0 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.5 million impact from the adoption of ASC Topic 842 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). See also Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt and our interest rate swap agreements.\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $1.5 million during 2018 related to amendments to our senior secured credit facility that included a reduction in the interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving credit line, revisions to certain definitions within the agreement, and an extension of the maturity of the revolving credit line. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Loss. We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $3.4 million during 2019 and a foreign currency exchange loss of $11.7 million during 2018 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from original transaction dates until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $12.9 million during 2019 and $15.4 million during 2018, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense - NCM. We recorded non-cash interest expense of $28.6 million during 2019 compared to $19.7 million during 2018 related to the significant financing component associated with revenues collected in advance under certain of our agreements with NCM. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of ASC Topic 606 and Note 5 for a summary of all activity with NCM.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $41.9 million during 2019 and $39.2 million during 2018. See Notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $80.5 million was recorded for 2019 compared to $96.0 million recorded for 2018. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 29.1%. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 30.7%, which included a net charge, as a result of the Tax Act and its related guidance, of $19.2 million all non-cash. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating Activities\nWe primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. Our revenues are generally received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, therefore we have an operating float\u201d and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $556.3 million and $561.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings, remodels and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $451.4 million and $310.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash used for investing activities for 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of NCM common units (see Note 7) for $78.4 million that occurred during 2018 and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> New\nTheatres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Existing\nTheatres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 346.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe operated 554 theatres with 6,132 screens worldwide as of December 31, 2019.

Cash used for financing activities primarily consists of dividends paid to our parent, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., payments on finance leases (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and repayments on our long-term debt.\nWe may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 646.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 5.125% senior notes due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 755.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 755.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,809.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,794.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Debt discounts and debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, less current portion, net of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,772.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,771.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to a letter of credit outstanding, we had $98.9 million in available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit line.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt obligations, scheduled interest payments on long-term debt, future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating and finance leases, scheduled interest payments under finance leases and other obligations for each period indicated are summarized as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 -

Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US Prime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2019, there was $646.3 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had no borrowings under the revolving credit line during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $98.9 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line, after giving effect to a letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019 was approximately 4.2% per annum.\nCinemark USA, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and the guarantors' personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.'s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries' and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement, not to exceed 5.0 to 1. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark USA, Inc.'s actual ratio was 2.98 to 1.\nThe dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.'s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $3,196.8 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc.\nWe have three interest rate swap agreements that are used to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 is included in Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 4, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2019, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising and screen rental revenue and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as the Metropolitan Opera, concert events, in-theatre gaming, live and pre-recorded sports programs and other special events in our theatres through Fathom Entertainment (operated by AC JV, LLC). National Cinemedia ( NCM\u201d) provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in-theatre advertising. Our Flix Media subsidiaries provide screen advertising and alternative content for our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2019 included Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, Frozen 2,The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel, SpiderMan: Far from Home, Aladdin, Joker, It: Chapter Two, Us, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, and Jumanji: The Next Level, among other films.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2020 include Bad Boys for Life, Onward, A Quiet Place: Part 2, Mulan, No Time to Die, Black Widow, Fast & Furious 9, Wonder Woman 1984, Soul, Top Gun: Maverick, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Jungle Cruise, The King's Man, The Eternals and Raya and the Last Dragon, among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. The Company also receives virtual print fees from studios for certain of its international locations, which are included as a contra-expense in film rentals and advertising costs; however, these costs are expected to be fully recovered in 2020. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and remodeled theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages tend to move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In certain locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease\nexpense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, credit card fees, third party ticket sales commissions, repairs and maintenance expenses, security services and expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which outlines how an entity should recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nOur patrons have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when products are sold to the consumer. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and screen rental revenues, promotional income, studio trailer placements and transactional fees. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as deferred revenues. Deferred revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as deferred revenues and record admissions revenues when the showtime for a movie ticket purchased with a credit has passed. We have loyalty programs in the U.S. and many of our international locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as deferred revenues based on the number of reward points issued to customers and we recognize the deferred revenues when the customer redeems such points. The value of loyalty points issued is based on the estimated fair value of the rewards offered. The Company records breakage revenue on gift cards and discount ticket vouchers generally based on redemption activity and historical experience with unused balances. The Company records breakage revenue upon the expiration of loyalty points and subscription credits. Breakage revenue is recorded as other revenues on the consolidated income statements. Advances collected on concession and other contracts are deferred and recognized during the period in which we satisfy the related performance obligations, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected. These advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as we meet our performance obligations in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\nFilm rental costs are subject to the film licensing arrangement and accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either; 1) a sliding scale formula, which is generally established prior to the opening of the film, 2) firm terms or 3) estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film for its full run. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when the initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.\nOur advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASC Topic 842\u201d). The purpose of ASC Topic 842 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. We adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and elected certain practical expedients. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 theatre property and equipment carrying values; \n \u2022 operating lease right-of-use asset carrying values; \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n \u2022 the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; \n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties, and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment includes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. We performed a qualitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If\nthe estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we performed qualitative tradename impairment analyses. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments\u201d below.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units\nunder the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We elected the following practical expedients, as allowed by ASC Topic 842:\n \u2022 We chose not to separate nonlease components from lease components, accounting for lease components and nonlease components associated with a lease as a single lease component. More specifically, for theatre leases, we elected not to separate fixed common area maintenance costs from lease costs when calculating lease liabilities and assets. \n \u2022 We did not reassess whether existing contracts in effect as of the transition date of January 1, 2019 were, or contained, a lease. \n \u2022 We did not reassess the classification of existing leases as operating or finance as of the transition date. \n \u2022 We did not reassess whether any initial direct costs were incurred for any of its existing leases. \n \u2022 We did not elect to apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases. \nThe adoption of ASC Topic 842 included the following primary impacts:\n 1. We recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all of our operating leases as required by the standard. The lease liability for each lease was determined based on the present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset was based on the lease liability value, adjusted for offsets that existed as of adoption, including deferred rent liabilities of ($39.2 million), net favorable and unfavorable lease intangibles of ($5.8 million), deferred lease incentive liabilities of ($13.0 million) and long-term prepaid rents of $7.7 million. We recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of $1,491.2 million and operating lease liabilities of $1,545.2 million upon adoption. \n 2. Certain of our existing lease assets and liabilities, which were accounted for under prior sale-leaseback accounting guidance, were derecognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842 and reevaluated for classification per the new accounting guidance. Several of these leases have been reestablished as operating leases based on ASC Topic 842. \n a. For those leases that are now classified as operating leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, approximately $110.4 million and $126.4 million of lease assets and liabilities, respectively, were recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The related net deferred income tax asset for these accounts was also recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. See additional impact discussed in item 3 below. \n b. We recognized finance lease assets and liabilities in the amount of $57.4 million as of January 1, 2019 for the remaining leases that were determined to be finance leases under ASC Topic 842. \n 3. For the leases noted in item 2a above, we now record the related operating lease payments as facility lease expense, compared to prior periods in which the capitalized asset was depreciated and lease payments were recorded as a reduction of a lease liability and interest expense. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 is included in Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 4, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2019, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising and screen rental revenue and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as the Metropolitan Opera, concert events, in-theatre gaming, live and pre-recorded sports programs and other special events in our theatres through Fathom Entertainment (operated by AC JV, LLC). National Cinemedia ( NCM\u201d) provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in-theatre advertising. Our Flix Media subsidiaries provide screen advertising and alternative content for our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2019 included Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, Frozen 2,The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel, SpiderMan: Far from Home, Aladdin, Joker, It: Chapter Two, Us, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, and Jumanji: The Next Level, among other films.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2020 include Bad Boys for Life, Onward, A Quiet Place: Part 2, Mulan, No Time to Die, Black Widow, Fast & Furious 9, Wonder Woman 1984, Soul, Top Gun: Maverick, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Jungle Cruise, The King's Man, The Eternals and Raya and the Last Dragon, among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. The Company also receives virtual print fees from studios for certain of its international locations, which are included as a contra-expense in film rentals and advertising costs; however, these costs are expected to be fully recovered in 2020. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and remodeled theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages tend to move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In certain locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease\nexpense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, credit card fees, third party ticket sales commissions, repairs and maintenance expenses, security services and expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which outlines how an entity should recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nOur patrons have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when products are sold to the consumer. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and screen rental revenues, promotional income, studio trailer placements and transactional fees. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as deferred revenues. Deferred revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as deferred revenues and record admissions revenues when the showtime for a movie ticket purchased with a credit has passed. We have loyalty programs in the U.S. and many of our international locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as deferred revenues based on the number of reward points issued to customers and we recognize the deferred revenues when the customer redeems such points. The value of loyalty points issued is based on the estimated fair value of the rewards offered. The Company records breakage revenue on gift cards and discount ticket vouchers generally based on redemption activity and historical experience with unused balances. The Company records breakage revenue upon the expiration of loyalty points and subscription credits. Breakage revenue is recorded as other revenues on the consolidated income statements. Advances collected on concession and other contracts are deferred and recognized during the period in which we satisfy the related performance obligations, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected. These advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as we meet our performance obligations in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\nFilm rental costs are subject to the film licensing arrangement and accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either; 1) a sliding scale formula, which is generally established prior to the opening of the film, 2) firm terms or 3) estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film for its full run. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when the initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.\nOur advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASC Topic 842\u201d). The purpose of ASC Topic 842 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. We adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and elected certain practical expedients. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 theatre property and equipment carrying values; \n \u2022 operating lease right-of-use asset carrying values; \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n \u2022 the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; \n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties, and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment includes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. We performed a qualitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If\nthe estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we performed qualitative tradename impairment analyses. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments\u201d below.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units\nunder the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach that resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We elected the following practical expedients, as allowed by ASC Topic 842:\n \u2022 We chose not to separate nonlease components from lease components, accounting for lease components and nonlease components associated with a lease as a single lease component. More specifically, for theatre leases, we elected not to separate fixed common area maintenance costs from lease costs when calculating lease liabilities and assets. \n \u2022 We did not reassess whether existing contracts in effect as of the transition date of January 1, 2019 were, or contained, a lease. \n \u2022 We did not reassess the classification of existing leases as operating or finance as of the transition date. \n \u2022 We did not reassess whether any initial direct costs were incurred for any of its existing leases. \n \u2022 We did not elect to apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases. \nThe adoption of ASC Topic 842 included the following primary impacts:\n 1. We recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all of our operating leases as required by the standard. The lease liability for each lease was determined based on the present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset was based on the lease liability value, adjusted for offsets that existed as of adoption, including deferred rent liabilities of ($39.2 million), net favorable and unfavorable lease intangibles of ($5.8 million), deferred lease incentive liabilities of ($13.0 million) and long-term prepaid rents of $7.7 million. We recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of $1,491.2 million and operating lease liabilities of $1,545.2 million upon adoption. \n 2. Certain of our existing lease assets and liabilities, which were accounted for under prior sale-leaseback accounting guidance, were derecognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842 and reevaluated for classification per the new accounting guidance. Several of these leases have been reestablished as operating leases based on ASC Topic 842. \n a. For those leases that are now classified as operating leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, approximately $110.4 million and $126.4 million of lease assets and liabilities, respectively, were recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The related net deferred income tax asset for these accounts was also recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. See additional impact discussed in item 3 below. \n b. We recognized finance lease assets and liabilities in the amount of $57.4 million as of January 1, 2019 for the remaining leases that were determined to be finance leases under ASC Topic 842. \n 3. For the leases noted in item 2a above, we now record the related operating lease payments as facility lease expense, compared to prior periods in which the capitalized asset was depreciated and lease payments were recorded as a reduction of a lease liability and interest expense. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items
