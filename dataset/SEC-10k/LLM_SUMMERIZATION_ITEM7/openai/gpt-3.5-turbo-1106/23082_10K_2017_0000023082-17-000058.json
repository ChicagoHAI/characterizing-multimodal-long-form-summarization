MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and associated notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe three primary objectives of this discussion are to:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>provide a narrative on the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and related notes by providing context to analyze the consolidated financial statements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo achieve these objectives, management's discussion and analysis is presented with the following sections:\nOverview - includes a description of our business and how it earns revenues and generates cash, as well as a discussion of economic and industry factors, key business drivers and key performance indicators.\nResults of Operations - discusses year-over-year changes to operating results for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, describing the factors affecting revenues on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and divestitures and currency impacts; describes the factors affecting changes in our major cost and expense categories and discusses our non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes our liquidity and available capital resources.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - details our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations - details our outstanding contractual obligations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - discusses our accounting estimates based on management judgments and assumptions which could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nEconomic and Industry Factors\nManagement monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. We are seeing the IT services industry being transformed by a shift in customer demand towards digital services and solutions. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes to deliver industry-leading service offerings is a key driver of our performance.\nOver the past five years we have made key acquisitions in hybrid cloud solutions, digital enterprise applications and insurance and healthcare as well as divested non-core businesses to optimize our service portfolio. We have responded to the industry trends we identified by streamlining our service offerings and implementing a strategy of selling defined solutions that require less customization. Such solutions include our portfolio of cloud-based IaaS offerings, managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing, storage, mobility and networking services.\nBusiness Drivers\nRevenues in both segments are generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenues include our ability to successfully:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>bid on and win new contract awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>satisfy existing customers and obtain add-on business and win contract recompetes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>compete with respect to services offered, delivery models offered, technical ability and innovation, quality, flexibility, global reach, experience and results created; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and our ability to:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>integrate acquisitions and eliminate redundant costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>anticipate talent needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>effectively manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations through the use of short-term foreign currency forward and option contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows are affected by the above drivers and the following factors:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability to efficiently manage capital resources and expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>timely management of receivables and payables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and implementations, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>tax obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess the performance of our business through various financial measures, primarily new contract wins, revenues and consolidated segment operating margins.\nNew contract wins: In addition to being a primary driver of future revenues, new contract wins also provide management an assessment of our ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or recompeted contracts, as well as numerous external factors.\nRevenues: Amounts recognized as earned from contracts won in prior periods and additional work secured in the current year. Year-over-year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenues.\nConsolidated segment operating margins: Reflect performance on our contracts and ability to control its costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenues can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of our costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes us to additional margin fluctuations.\nResults of Operations\nWe report our results based on a fiscal year convention that comprises four thirteen-week quarters. Every fifth year includes an additional week in the first three months of the fiscal year to prevent the fiscal year from moving from an approximate end of March date. Fiscal 2015 was the last year which included the additional week.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed the Separation of NPS and merger of NPS with SRA International, Inc. to form a new publicly traded company, CSRA Inc. As a result of the Separation, the consolidated statements of operations and related financial information reflect NPS's operations as discontinued operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015.\nThe following table provides an analysis for select line items of the consolidated statements of operations:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per-share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations, before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues by segment are shown in the tables below:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fiscal 2017 revenues increased $501 million as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth in our GBS segment and revenues from our recent acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2017 revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $317 million caused by contracts that concluded or were renewed at lower rates and a $221 million adverse impact of foreign currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound.\nOur fiscal 2016 revenues decreased $1.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues caused by contract terminations, conclusions and contractual price reductions of $644 million and the adverse impact of foreign currency movement of $467 million, partially offset by a $100 million increase due to acquisitions.\nAs a global company, historically, more than half of our revenues have been earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, the changes in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period are impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As such, the following discussion contains financial results on a constant currency basis eliminating the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby providing meaningful period over period comparisons of operating performance. Financial results on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP measures calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period's currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends.\nThe tables below indicate the percentage change in revenues due to changes in exchange rates:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Years Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 vs. April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase at Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nImpact of\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Net Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Years Ended\nApril 1, 2016 vs. April 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease at Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nImpact of\nCurrency Fluctuations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Net Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nThe discussion below explains the reasons for revenue changes other than as a result of foreign currency fluctuations.\nGlobal Business Services\nThe $654 million, or 18.0%, constant currency increase for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in next generation business processing services offerings, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, primarily within our Digital Applications business and our IS&S business where we continue to prioritize the development of our digital capabilities. Digital Applications, our consulting and applications business, increased over 38% in constant currency and IS&S increased over 26% in constant currency when compared to prior fiscal year. The increase was largely due to revenues from our recent acquisitions which we continue to integrate into our existing business and new business revenues increased $249 million. These increases were partially offset by a $274 million decrease in revenues from contracts that concluded and a $131 million decline from contracts renewed at lower rates.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment constant currency revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $68 million, or 2.0%, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $243 million in revenues from new business and an increase in revenues contributed from our recent acquisitions. In addition, we recognized incremental revenues of $43 million under our segment's portion of the IP matters agreement (see note 3 - \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements). These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of $335 million from contracts that concluded, $89 million from contracts renewed with scope changes and $23 million due to price-downs. We continue to take actions to mitigate the secular headwinds facing our traditional IT outsourcing business and focus GIS on the next generation digital needs of our clients.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nGlobal Business Services\nGBS segment revenues decreased $399 million, or 9.9%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $154 million, or 3.8%, which was an improvement as compared to the fiscal 2015 revenues decrease in constant currency of 4.7%. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $245 million, or 61.4% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. The revenue decrease in constant currency included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016.\nIncluded in fiscal 2016 revenues is acquisition revenues of $65 million from the acquisition of Fruition Partners, Axon, and UXC, which were completed late in the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment revenues decreased $612 million, or 15.0%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $390 million, or 9.6%, due to reduced revenues from contracts that terminated or concluded as well as an unfavorable impact from price-downs and contract restructurings. It also included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. These revenue decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from new contracts and acquisitions. The increase in revenues due to acquisitions totaled $35 million from Fixnetix and UXC completed late in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $222 million, or 36.3% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur total costs and expenses were as follows:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative (excludes depreciation and amortization, SEC settlement related charges and restructuring costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative - SEC settlement related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Services\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nCOS as a percentage of revenues (\"COS ratio\") remained consistent year over year. The $360 million increase in costs of services, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges (\"COS\") was largely related to our acquisitions and a $31 million gain on the sale of certain intangible assets in our GIS segment during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year. This increase was offset by management's ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a year-over-year favorable change of $28 million to pension and other post-retirement benefit (\"OPEB\") actuarial and settlement losses associated with our defined benefit pension plans. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $219 million and $7 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nThe net reduction in COS was a result of management's cost reduction initiatives, including reduced headcount, that sought to align our cost structure with business needs. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recognized $100 million and $525 million, respectively, of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses in COS. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $7 million and $248 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe COS ratio decreased to 73.0% for fiscal 2016 from 76.0% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the COS ratio for fiscal 2016 was due to the reduction in revenues and the $425 million year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of actuarial and pension settlement losses. This decrease was partially offset by a gain of $31 million on the sale of certain intangible assets and other COS decreases.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, SEC settlement related charges and restructuring charges (\"SG&A ratio\"), increased 2.2% to 16.8% for fiscal 2017 from 14.6% for fiscal 2016. The increase was due to transaction and integration costs of $305 million associated with our recent acquisitions and the Merger, an increase of $16 million in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses and a non-recurring settlement recovery of $16 million recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") during fiscal 2016, not present in the current fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by higher revenues. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we recognized $15 million and $(1) million, respectively, of actuarial and pension settlement losses (gains) in SG&A. The amount of restructuring charges, net of adjustments, excluded from SG&A was $19 million and $16 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nSG&A expense, excluding restructuring charges of $16 million and $8 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a percentage of revenues, decreased slightly to 14.6% for fiscal 2016 from 15.0% for fiscal 2015. The SG&A ratio for fiscal 2016 was impacted by the year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses. We recognized no actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A during fiscal 2016. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we recognized $59 million of actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A, resulting from the remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans.\nExcluding the impact of the pension adjustments described above, the SG&A ratio increased 0.3% for fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015. The increase in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the reduction in revenues, which more than offset the decrease in SG&A. The lower SG&A costs during fiscal 2016 were primarily the result of management's cost reduction initiatives that sought to align our cost structure with business needs and a settlement recovery of $16 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative - SEC Settlement Related Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015, we reached an understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding a settlement of a formal civil investigation by the SEC that commenced during fiscal 2012 and covered a range of matters as previously disclosed, including certain of our prior disclosures and accounting determinations. As part of our understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a penalty of $190 million and to implement a review of our compliance policies through an independent compliance consultant. We recorded pre-tax charges of $197 million for the penalty and related expenses in fiscal 2015. See Note 22 - \"Settlement of SEC Investigation\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nDepreciation and amortization (\"D&A\") as a percentage of revenues decreased less than 1% to 8.5% for fiscal 2017 from 9.3% for fiscal 2016 due to an increase in revenues for the GBS segment and lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of reduced capital expenditures from contract terminations, as well as a continued focus on capital efficiency. The decrease in the D&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to our recent acquisitions, primarily within the GBS segment.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nD&A as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.3% for fiscal 2016 from 10.3% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the ratio was primarily driven by lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of lower capital expenditures and sale of contract assets to customers where contracts had concluded.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments. During fiscal 2017 we initiated restructuring actions in certain areas to realign our cost structure and resources to take advantage of operational efficiencies following recent acquisitions and in anticipation of the Merger. Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, were largely the result of implementing workforce reductions. Under our Fiscal 2016 Plan our objective was to optimize utilization of facilities and right size overhead organizations as a result of the Separation. Our objective under our Fiscal 2015 plan was to reduce headcount in order to align resources to support business needs, accelerate efforts to optimize the workforce in high cost markets, particularly in Europe, address our labor pyramid and right-shore our labor mix.\nTotal restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $238 million, $23 million and $256 million, respectively. Fiscal 2015 restructuring costs included a special restructuring charge of $241 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The net amounts recorded included $6 million, $7 million and $3 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years. The remaining liabilities under the Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 plans were paid or reversed during fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, as we integrate our businesses after the Merger, we plan to incur restructuring expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and an additional $400 million in fiscal 2019.\nSeparation Costs\nCosts associated with activities relating to the Separation of NPS during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of $19 million were expensed when incurred. These costs were comprised primarily of third-party accounting, legal and other consulting services. There were no separation costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nInterest expense for fiscal 2017 was $117 million as compared to $123 million in fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense was due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 redemption of our 6.50% term notes and lower interest rates on our existing debt.\nInterest income for fiscal 2017 was $35 million as compared to $38 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average deposit balances in our money market funds and money market deposit accounts during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $123 million as compared to $126 million in fiscal 2015. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates than the prior year, which more than offset the increase in borrowings. Included in interest expense for fiscal 2016 is a write-off of $2 million of deferred costs and discount related to the redemption of the 6.50% term notes due March 2018 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest income for fiscal 2016 was $38 million as compared to $20 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in interest income for fiscal 2016 resulted both from higher interest rates in some of the jurisdictions where we hold balances and principally from increased payments from banks for higher compensating deposit balances in our cash management operations and notional pooling arrangements that are counterbalanced by higher overdraft fees and interest expense.\nDebt Extinguishment Costs\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed all outstanding 6.50% term notes due March 2018 at par plus redemption premiums related to a make-whole provision and accrued interest. We recorded $95 million of debt extinguishment costs within the consolidated statement of operations, which consists primarily of the redemption premiums mentioned above. There were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nOther (income) expense, net comprises movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses. The $1 million year-over-year increase in other income was due to a $7 million year-over-year benefit of favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates used to fair value our foreign currency forward contracts and the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities partially offset by a $6 million gain on sale of certain assets during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nOther (income) expense, net increased by $19 million primarily due to the $12 million benefit of favorable movements in exchange rates and the aforementioned $6 million gain on sale of assets.\nTaxes\nOur effective tax rate (\"ETR\") on income (loss) from continuing operations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was (42.5)%, (620.0)% and (69.2)%, respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 11 - \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2017, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A change in the valuation allowance that primarily consists of an aggregate income tax detriment for the increase in the valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.S., Germany and Luxembourg, which decreased the overall income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $135 million and 78%, respectively.

The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company and the IRS reached an agreement in principle as to the settlement terms and the Company remeasured its uncertain tax positions. This audit cycle is now under review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through November 30, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we are undergoing an IRS audit for the fiscal 2011 through 2013 U.S. Federal tax returns. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we received a Revenue Agent's Report, which includes proposed adjustments to previously filed tax returns. We continue to believe that our tax positions are more-likely-than-not sustainable and that we will ultimately prevail.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of taxes, for fiscal 2016 and 2015, primarily reflects the results of operations of our former NPS segment. Fiscal 2015 also included the results of operations from the sale of a German software business within the GBS segment and the related $18 million net loss recorded on its disposition.\n(Loss) Earnings Per Share\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 decreased $1.38 per share to $(0.88) per share primarily due to $403 million of transaction and integration related costs during the current fiscal year for the Merger and other acquisitions. In addition, restructuring costs increased $215 million as compared to the same period a year ago. These decreases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of fiscal 2016 debt extinguishment costs of $95 million.\nTotal diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 decreased $2.66 per share due to the reasons mentioned above for EPS from continuing operations and the lack of discontinued operations associated with the Separation of NPS during the current fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nDiluted EPS for fiscal 2016 was $1.78, which was an increase of $1.77 from fiscal 2015. Diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 increased $1.95 and diluted EPS from discontinued operations decreased $0.18 when compared to fiscal 2015 results.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations increased primarily due to the following items (on a pre-tax basis):\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Favorable change in pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses of $485 million, or $3.43 per share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-recurrence of fiscal 2015 special restructuring charges of $241 million, or $1.71 per share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-recurrence of fiscal 2015 SEC settlement and related charges of $200 million, or 1.42 per share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Partially offset by debt extinguishment costs of $95 million, or (0.67) per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, diluted EPS from continuing operations was adversely impacted by the non-recurrence of the fiscal 2015 tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance of $264 million, or $(1.87) per share.\nThe decrease in diluted EPS from discontinued operations resulted primarily from a decrease in net income attributable to discontinued operations associated with the Separation of NPS partially offset by the non-recurrence of the fiscal 2015 loss on disposition of GBS' German software business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present non-GAAP financial measures of performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information. These non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated segment operating income, consolidated segment adjusted operating income, consolidated segment adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\"), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income from continuing operations before taxes, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items otherwise required by U.S. GAAP which management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand our financial performance exclusive of the impacts of corporate-wide strategic decisions. We believe that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. We believe the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering us as equity research analysts publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS.\nThere are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures we present. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies. Consolidated segment operating income and consolidated segment adjusted operating income are useful measures in evaluating the financial performance of our core segment business operations on a more comparable basis year-over-year. However, these measures could limit one's ability to assess our financial performance by excluding corporate G&A and certain other items. To compensate for this limitation, we provide a reconciliation between these measures and income from continuing operations, before taxes, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nNon-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP include:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP adjustments include:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restructuring costs - Reflects restructuring costs related to workforce optimization and real estate charges.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transaction and integration-related costs - Reflects costs related to (1) the Separation, (2) integration planning, financing and advisory fees associated with the Merger and (3) acquisitions and related intangible amortization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain overhead costs - Reflects certain fiscal 2016 and 2015 costs historically allocated to our former NPS segment but not included in discontinued operations due to accounting rules.

costs and segment SG&A expenses. Consolidated segment operating income excludes pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses and corporate G&A, which is largely associated with centrally managed overhead and shared-services functions which are not controlled by segment level leadership nor directly related to our core segment business operations. Consolidated segment adjusted operating income further excludes the impacts of corporate-wide strategic decisions, such as segment related restructuring and other transaction costs. We define consolidated segment adjusted operating margin as consolidated segment adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues.

and Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows\nAs of March 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion was held outside of the U.S. A substantial portion of funds can be returned to the US from funds advanced previously to fund our foreign acquisition initiatives. If additional funds held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.\nIn fiscal 2017 and 2016, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most of the major world currencies, particularly the British Pound, resulting in a $60 million and $57 million, respectively, adverse effect on cash and cash equivalents. The effect of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our net debt, which includes cash and cash equivalents, is discussed below under Capital Resources.\u201d\nDuring fiscal 2017, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of approximately $78 million in aggregate.\nCash and cash equivalents (\"cash\") increased $85 million year-over-year from fiscal 2016 to $1.3 billion, primarily due to cash provided by operations.

The increase was due to an increase in trade payables of $411 million, a decrease in net account receivables of $457 million, $32 million less restructuring charges compared to fiscal 2016 and a cash outflow of $190 million for SEC settlement paid in fiscal 2016 with no comparative outflow for the current year. In addition, payments received from CSRA under the amended IP matters agreement increased $35 million. The increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $189 million increase in transaction, integration and separation payments, an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable of $252 million and a $545 million decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash transactions from fiscal 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 was $802 million, which decreased $671 million as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was due to a decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the $249 million decline in our overall operating expenses, a payment of $190 million for the SEC settlement, lower collections of receivables of $108 million, $86 million of increased restructuring payments, $79 million of payments related to the Separation, $22 million paid for certain NPS overhead costs and a $176 million decrease from fiscal 2015 in net income adjusted for non-cash transactions. These cash flow decreases were partially offset by net proceeds of $239 million from our NPS segment receivables sales facility mentioned above.\nInvesting cash flow\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 decreased $254 million to $926 million. This decrease was driven by a decline of $120 million spent on acquisitions and a decline in capital expenditures of $150 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 of $1.2 billion increased $644 million compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in outflow was primarily due to an increase of $505 million for business acquisitions, $70 million in short-term investing in Xchanging and $94 million less cash received from the sale of assets. These increases were partially offset by proceeds from business divestitures of $50 million.\nFinancing cash flow\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $93 million, as compared to cash used of $485 million during fiscal 2016. The decline was due primarily to certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows that did not re-occur in the current year, including a $350 million repayment of our 2.5% term notes, $313 million special cash dividend paid as part of the Separation, $95 million payment for the early extinguishment of debt and $73 million treasury stock that occurred during fiscal 2016. These declines of cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a $254 million payment of acquired debt from the acquisition of Xchanging and $85 million in net proceeds from the structured sale of the Company's U.K. campus.\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $485 million, a decrease of $593 million from fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $769 million of lower share repurchases, increased net commercial paper borrowings of $558 million, increased net lines of credit borrowings of $381 million, and net of borrowings related to the Separation of NPS of $68 million. For more information about our share repurchase program see Note 14 - \"Stockholders' Equity\" to the\nconsolidated financial statements. These items were partially offset by the special cash dividend paid of $313 million as part of the Separation, as well as higher net payments on long-term debt of $941 million.\nCapital Resources\nSee Note 21 - \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of general purpose of guarantees and commitments.

For more information on our debt, see Note 12 - \"Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into various amendments to our revolving credit facility, term loans, commercial paper program and lease credit facility which, among other things, replaced CSC with DXC as the principal borrower or guarantor upon completion of the Merger. We were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of March 31, 2017 and April 1, 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our capitalization ratios:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt-to-total capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt-to-total capitalization(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Net debt and Net debt-to-total capitalization are non-GAAP measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone.\nThe increase in net debt-to-total capitalization was primarily the result of a $234 million increase in net debt, predominately due to funds borrowed to acquire Xchanging which was partially offset by the increase in cash generated from our operations.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in an unfavorable impact to cash and cash equivalents. At the same time, the translation of our debt off shore in non-US dollar currencies, including the British Pound, resulted in a favorable effect on these foreign currency liabilities, which counterbalanced the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from foreign currency exchange rates.\nLiquidity\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for the next twelve months. We expect to continue to use cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity, however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to draw on our multi-currency revolving credit facility or through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans and bonds. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms in the future.\nOur exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.\nThe following table summarizes our total liquidity: Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available borrowings under our lease credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nReceivables Securitization Facility\nOn December 21, 2016, we established a $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility providing for the sale of billed and unbilled accounts receivable which expires December 20, 2017, but may be extended. The proceeds from the sale of these receivables comprise a combination of cash and a deferred purchase price (\"DPP\"). We expect to use the proceeds from the receivables facility for general corporate purposes. The amount available under the receivables facility fluctuates over time based on the total amount of eligible receivables generated during the normal course of business after deducting excess concentrations. As of March 31, 2017, the total availability under the receivables facility was approximately $217 million.\nDuring fiscal 2017, we received $223 million in cash proceeds from the sale of receivables and recorded a DPP with a fair value as of March 31, 2017 of $252 million, which is included in receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, a $6 million liability was included within accounts payable because the amount of cash proceeds received under the receivables facility exceeded the maximum funding limit. We reflected all cash flows related to the receivables facility as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of our trade receivables.\nOur risk of loss for accounts receivable sold is limited to the DPP outstanding and any short-falls in collections for specified non-credit related reasons after sale. Payment of the DPP is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable sold.\nThe receivable securitization program agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including as to the eligibility of the receivables being sold, and contain customary program termination events and non-reinvestment events. We were in compliance with all covenants associated with our receivables facility as of March 31, 2017.\nGuarantees and Financial Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. In general, we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client. We also use stand-by letters of credit, in lieu of cash, to support various risk management insurance policies. These stand-by letters of credit represent a contingent liability and we would only be liable if we defaulted on our payment obligations on these policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note 21 - \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of March 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and preferred dividend payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized lease liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum purchase obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts represent scheduled principal payments of long-term debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary.\n(2) Amounts represent scheduled interest payments on long-term debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock outstanding excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features.\n(3) Includes long-term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers and exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition, income taxes, business combinations and defined benefit plans. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates that may change over time. However, some arrangements are subject to specific accounting guidance that may require significant estimates, including contracts subject to percentage-of-completion accounting, that include multiple-element deliverables or are subject to software accounting guidance.\nPercentage-of-completion method\nCertain software development projects and all long-term construction-type contracts require the use of estimates at completion in the application of the percentage-of-completion accounting method, whereby the determination of revenues and costs on a contract through its completion can require significant judgment and estimation. Under this method, and subject to the effects of changes in estimates, we recognize revenues using an estimated margin at completion as contract milestones or other input or output-based measures are achieved. This can result in costs being deferred as work in process until contractual billing milestones are achieved. Alternatively, this can result in revenues recognized in advance of billing milestones if output-based or input-based measures are achieved. Contracts that require estimates at completion using the percentage-of-completion method accounted for approximately 5% of our revenues.\nThe percentage-of-completion method requires estimates of revenues, costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers, program managers and financial professionals. We follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made; however, some estimates are particularly difficult for activities involving state-of-the-art technologies such as system development projects. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, results of testing procedures and progress toward completion. Management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become evident.\nWe periodically negotiate modifications to the scope, schedule and price of contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenues as current period contract performance.\nMultiple-element arrangements\nMany of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers, which may include a combination of services, products or both. As a result, significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the elements specified in a multiple-element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, when considered appropriate, how the total estimated revenues should be allocated among the elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element. Allocation of total contract consideration to each element requires estimating the fair value or selling price of each element based on vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"), third party evidence (\"TPE\") or management's best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") for the deliverables when VSOE or TPE are not available. VSOE is established for an element based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. TPE is established by considering our competitors' prices for comparable product and service offerings in the market in which we operate. When we conclude that comparable products or services are sold by competitors to similarly situated customers, we consult available information sources to arrive at TPE such as published list prices, quoted market prices and industry reports. We establish BESP consistent with our existing pricing practices involving a cost-plus-reasonable-margin methodology as well as comparison of the margins to those realized on recent contracts for similar products or services in that market. Once the total estimated revenues have been allocated to the various contract elements, revenues for each element are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered if the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception.\nSoftware sales\nIf significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, and VSOE is available to support accounting for the software as a separate unit of account, the software is determined to be delivered as the customization services are performed and revenue is recognized in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method described above. In such cases, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a\nmaterial effect on results. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition.\nCapitalization of Outsourcing Contract Costs\nCertain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set-up costs, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to customers in excess of the fair market value of assets acquired (i.e., contract premiums). Amortization of contract premiums is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance.\nKey estimates and assumptions include assessing the fair value of assets acquired from a customer in order to calculate the contract premium and project future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties when warranted, to determine the fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the carrying amount of contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nCapitalization of Software Development Costs\nAfter establishing technological feasibility, we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. We also capitalize costs to develop or purchase internal-use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment.\nDetermining the appropriate amortization period for commercial software products is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete.\nFor internal-use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we consider estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of our professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, analyzing our income tax reserves, the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjustment of valuation allowances accordingly. In addition, our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. For example, we are currently undergoing an IRS audit for fiscal 2011 through 2013 U.S. Federal tax returns.\nAs a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, the extent to which our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, changes in tax regulations, acquisitions, dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income. We cannot predict what our ETR will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors.\nWith regards to non-U.S. earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S, we use the lower undistributed tax rate to measure deferred taxes on inside basis differences, including undistributed earnings, of our India operations as these earnings are permanently reinvested. If we change our intent and distribute such earnings either in the form of a dividend or a share buyback, higher dividend distribution tax or share buyback tax will be incurred as a result of additional\nlegislation effective in May 2015 related to the India Finance Act of 2013 that increased the share buyback tax rate to 23.07% and increased the dividend distribution tax rate to 20.36%, among other changes.\nConsiderations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2017 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets. However, valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors.\nChanges in tax laws, such as tax reform in the U.S. or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting\u201d could impact our effective tax rate. As an example, the reduction in the main rate of U.K. corporation tax to 17.0% effective April 1, 2020 is expected to reduce the value of our U.K. deferred tax assets by approximately $10 million. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. For example, we have favorable positions related to the research & development tax credit, bonus depreciation and the look-through rules related to Subpart F income that has historically been subject to annual extension, resulting in uncertainty in estimating future income tax results. In 2015, Congress enacted the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, which made several of these provisions permanent, or extended them for multiple years, which improved our ability to forecast income tax in future years.\nThe Finance Act of 2012 (the \"2012 Finance Act\") was signed into law in India on May 28, 2012. The 2012 Finance Act provides for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in India, including on a retroactive basis. The 2012 Finance Act overrides the Vodafone NL ruling by the Supreme Court of India which held that the Indian Tax Authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of non-Indian companies that indirectly own shares in an Indian company. The retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized and challenged in the Indian courts; however, there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful. We have engaged in the purchase of shares of foreign companies that indirectly own shares of an Indian company and internal reorganizations involving Indian companies. The Indian tax authorities may seek to apply the provisions of the 2012 Finance Act to these prior transactions and seek to tax us directly or as a withholding agent or representative assessee of the sellers involved in prior acquisitions. We believe that the 2012 Finance Act does not apply to these prior acquisitions and that we have strong defenses against any claims that might be raised by the Indian tax authorities.\nThe U.K. Finance Act 2017 (the \"U.K. Finance Act\") proposed in December 2016 will impose restrictions on the utilization of prior period losses against current period profits, limitations on interest deductions, changes to anti-hybrid rules and expand the scope of withholding taxes to certain intangible assets. As the detail of the legislation has yet to be finalized or enacted, it is difficult at this stage to determine the impact of the U.K. Finance Act on our future financial results in the U.K. When fully enacted, the provisions of the U.K. Finance Act are expected to take effect from April 1, 2017.\nAssumptions Related to Acquisition-method Accounting, Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\u201d A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an event representing an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. Such indicators may include: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reductions in revenue or profitability growth rates. An adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill.\nThe Company follows GAAP-prescribed rules when determining if goodwill has been impaired. Initially, an assessment of qualitative factors is conducted in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that its carrying amount is less than its fair value for a reporting unit, then the subsequent two-step goodwill impairment testing process is not required. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its carrying amount is greater than its fair value for a reporting unit, then it proceeds with the subsequent two-step process.\nThe Company has the option to bypass the initial qualitative assessment stage and proceed directly to perform step one of the two-step process. Step one of the process compares each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. In this step, the reporting unit's fair value is determined and allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in order to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business acquisition. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and market approach. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a discount rate. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The discount rate in turn is based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit, the weighted average cost of capital and its underlying forecast. The market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting unit's prior and expected operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit derived using the income approach is significantly different from the fair value estimate using the market approach, the Company reevaluates its assumptions used in the two models. The fair values determined by the market approach and income approach, as described above, are weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit. The weighted values assigned to each reporting unit are primarily influenced by two factors: 1) the number of comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach, and 2) the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, the Company also compares the sum of the reporting units' fair values to its market capitalization (per share stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair values over the market capitalization). The Company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, the Company reevaluates its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions. As a result, when the price for CSC's common stock is low, this reevaluation can result in lower estimated fair values of the reporting units.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal growth rates and capital expenditures, as well as discount rates. Estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs of existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. In addition, judgments and assumptions are required for allocating acquired assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each of our reporting units. In addition, although we have consistently used the same\nmethods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain and may vary from actual results.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe computation of our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. Inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates. Our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary. The fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and associated notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe three primary objectives of this discussion are to:\n 1. provide a narrative on the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; \n 2. enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and related notes by providing context to analyze the consolidated financial statements; and \n 3. provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. \nTo achieve these objectives, management's discussion and analysis is presented with the following sections:\nOverview - includes a description of our business and how it earns revenues and generates cash, as well as a discussion of economic and industry factors, key business drivers and key performance indicators.\nResults of Operations - discusses year-over-year changes to operating results for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, describing the factors affecting revenues on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and divestitures and currency impacts; describes the factors affecting changes in our major cost and expense categories and discusses our non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes our liquidity and available capital resources.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - details our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations - details our outstanding contractual obligations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - discusses our accounting estimates based on management judgments and assumptions which could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nEconomic and Industry Factors\nManagement monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. We are seeing the IT services industry being transformed by a shift in customer demand towards digital services and solutions. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes to deliver industry-leading service offerings is a key driver of our performance.\nOver the past five years we have made key acquisitions in hybrid cloud solutions, digital enterprise applications and insurance and healthcare as well as divested non-core businesses to optimize our service portfolio. We have responded to the industry trends we identified by streamlining our service offerings and implementing a strategy of selling defined solutions that require less customization. Such solutions include our portfolio of cloud-based IaaS offerings, managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing, storage, mobility and networking services.\nBusiness Drivers\nRevenues in both segments are generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenues include our ability to successfully:\n \u2022 bid on and win new contract awards; \n \u2022 satisfy existing customers and obtain add-on business and win contract recompetes; \n \u2022 compete with respect to services offered, delivery models offered, technical ability and innovation, quality, flexibility, global reach, experience and results created; and \n \u2022 identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues. \nEarnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and our ability to:\n \u2022 integrate acquisitions and eliminate redundant costs; \n \u2022 develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore; \n \u2022 control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs; \n \u2022 anticipate talent needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses; \n \u2022 accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals; and \n \u2022 effectively manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations through the use of short-term foreign currency forward and option contracts. \nCash flows are affected by the above drivers and the following factors:\n \u2022 the ability to efficiently manage capital resources and expenditures; \n \u2022 timely management of receivables and payables; \n \u2022 investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and implementations, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts; and \n \u2022 tax obligations. \nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess the performance of our business through various financial measures, primarily new contract wins, revenues and consolidated segment operating margins.\nNew contract wins: In addition to being a primary driver of future revenues, new contract wins also provide management an assessment of our ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or recompeted contracts, as well as numerous external factors.\nRevenues: Amounts recognized as earned from contracts won in prior periods and additional work secured in the current year. Year-over-year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenues.\nConsolidated segment operating margins: Reflect performance on our contracts and ability to control its costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenues can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of our costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes us to additional margin fluctuations.\nResults of Operations\nWe report our results based on a fiscal year convention that comprises four thirteen-week quarters. Every fifth year includes an additional week in the first three months of the fiscal year to prevent the fiscal year from moving from an approximate end of March date. Fiscal 2015 was the last year which included the additional week.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed the Separation of NPS and merger of NPS with SRA International, Inc. to form a new publicly traded company, CSRA Inc. As a result of the Separation, the consolidated statements of operations and related financial information reflect NPS's operations as discontinued operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015.\nThe following table provides an analysis for select line items of the consolidated statements of operations:\n\nRevenues\nRevenues by segment are shown in the tables below:\n\nOur fiscal 2017 revenues increased $501 million as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth in our GBS segment and revenues from our recent acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2017 revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $317 million caused by contracts that concluded or were renewed at lower rates and a $221 million adverse impact of foreign currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound.\nOur fiscal 2016 revenues decreased $1.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues caused by contract terminations, conclusions and contractual price reductions of $644 million and the adverse impact of foreign currency movement of $467 million, partially offset by a $100 million increase due to acquisitions.\nAs a global company, historically, more than half of our revenues have been earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, the changes in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period are impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As such, the following discussion contains financial results on a constant currency basis eliminating the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby providing meaningful period over period comparisons of operating performance. Financial results on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP measures calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period's currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends.\nThe tables below indicate the percentage change in revenues due to changes in exchange rates:\n\n\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nThe discussion below explains the reasons for revenue changes other than as a result of foreign currency fluctuations.\nGlobal Business Services\nThe $654 million, or 18.0%, constant currency increase for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in next generation business processing services offerings, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, primarily within our Digital Applications business and our IS&S business where we continue to prioritize the development of our digital capabilities. Digital Applications, our consulting and applications business, increased over 38% in constant currency and IS&S increased over 26% in constant currency when compared to prior fiscal year. The increase was largely due to revenues from our recent acquisitions which we continue to integrate into our existing business and new business revenues increased $249 million. These increases were partially offset by a $274 million decrease in revenues from contracts that concluded and a $131 million decline from contracts renewed at lower rates.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment constant currency revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $68 million, or 2.0%, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $243 million in revenues from new business and an increase in revenues contributed from our recent acquisitions. In addition, we recognized incremental revenues of $43 million under our segment's portion of the IP matters agreement (see note 3 - \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements). These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of $335 million from contracts that concluded, $89 million from contracts renewed with scope changes and $23 million due to price-downs. We continue to take actions to mitigate the secular headwinds facing our traditional IT outsourcing business and focus GIS on the next generation digital needs of our clients.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nGlobal Business Services\nGBS segment revenues decreased $399 million, or 9.9%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $154 million, or 3.8%, which was an improvement as compared to the fiscal 2015 revenues decrease in constant currency of 4.7%. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $245 million, or 61.4% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. The revenue decrease in constant currency included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016.\nIncluded in fiscal 2016 revenues is acquisition revenues of $65 million from the acquisition of Fruition Partners, Axon, and UXC, which were completed late in the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment revenues decreased $612 million, or 15.0%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $390 million, or 9.6%, due to reduced revenues from contracts that terminated or concluded as well as an unfavorable impact from price-downs and contract restructurings. It also included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. These revenue decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from new contracts and acquisitions. The increase in revenues due to acquisitions totaled $35 million from Fixnetix and UXC completed late in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $222 million, or 36.3% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur total costs and expenses were as follows:\n\nCosts of Services\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nCOS as a percentage of revenues (\"COS ratio\") remained consistent year over year. The $360 million increase in costs of services, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges (\"COS\") was largely related to our acquisitions and a $31 million gain on the sale of certain intangible assets in our GIS segment during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year. This increase was offset by management's ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a year-over-year favorable change of $28 million to pension and other post-retirement benefit (\"OPEB\") actuarial and settlement losses associated with our defined benefit pension plans. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $219 million and $7 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nThe net reduction in COS was a result of management's cost reduction initiatives, including reduced headcount, that sought to align our cost structure with business needs. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recognized $100 million and $525 million, respectively, of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses in COS. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $7 million and $248 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe COS ratio decreased to 73.0% for fiscal 2016 from 76.0% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the COS ratio for fiscal 2016 was due to the reduction in revenues and the $425 million year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of actuarial and pension settlement losses. This decrease was partially offset by a gain of $31 million on the sale of certain intangible assets and other COS decreases.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, SEC settlement related charges and restructuring charges (\"SG&A ratio\"), increased 2.2% to 16.8% for fiscal 2017 from 14.6% for fiscal 2016. The increase was due to transaction and integration costs of $305 million associated with our recent acquisitions and the Merger, an increase of $16 million in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses and a non-recurring settlement recovery of $16 million recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") during fiscal 2016, not present in the current fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by higher revenues. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we recognized $15 million and $(1) million, respectively, of actuarial and pension settlement losses (gains) in SG&A. The amount of restructuring charges, net of adjustments, excluded from SG&A was $19 million and $16 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nSG&A expense, excluding restructuring charges of $16 million and $8 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a percentage of revenues, decreased slightly to 14.6% for fiscal 2016 from 15.0% for fiscal 2015. The SG&A ratio for fiscal 2016 was impacted by the year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses. We recognized no actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A during fiscal 2016. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we recognized $59 million of actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A, resulting from the remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans.\nExcluding the impact of the pension adjustments described above, the SG&A ratio increased 0.3% for fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015. The increase in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the reduction in revenues, which more than offset the decrease in SG&A. The lower SG&A costs during fiscal 2016 were primarily the result of management's cost reduction initiatives that sought to align our cost structure with business needs and a settlement recovery of $16 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative - SEC Settlement Related Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015, we reached an understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding a settlement of a formal civil investigation by the SEC that commenced during fiscal 2012 and covered a range of matters as previously disclosed, including certain of our prior disclosures and accounting determinations. As part of our understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a penalty of $190 million and to implement a review of our compliance policies through an independent compliance consultant. We recorded pre-tax charges of $197 million for the penalty and related expenses in fiscal 2015. See Note 22 - \"Settlement of SEC Investigation\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nDepreciation and amortization (\"D&A\") as a percentage of revenues decreased less than 1% to 8.5% for fiscal 2017 from 9.3% for fiscal 2016 due to an increase in revenues for the GBS segment and lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of reduced capital expenditures from contract terminations, as well as a continued focus on capital efficiency. The decrease in the D&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to our recent acquisitions, primarily within the GBS segment.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nD&A as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.3% for fiscal 2016 from 10.3% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the ratio was primarily driven by lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of lower capital expenditures and sale of contract assets to customers where contracts had concluded.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments. During fiscal 2017 we initiated restructuring actions in certain areas to realign our cost structure and resources to take advantage of operational efficiencies following recent acquisitions and in anticipation of the Merger. Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, were largely the result of implementing workforce reductions. Under our Fiscal 2016 Plan our objective was to optimize utilization of facilities and right size overhead organizations as a result of the Separation. Our objective under our Fiscal 2015 plan was to reduce headcount in order to align resources to support business needs, accelerate efforts to optimize the workforce in high cost markets, particularly in Europe, address our labor pyramid and right-shore our labor mix.\nTotal restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $238 million, $23 million and $256 million, respectively. Fiscal 2015 restructuring costs included a special restructuring charge of $241 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The net amounts recorded included $6 million, $7 million and $3 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years. The remaining liabilities under the Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 plans were paid or reversed during fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, as we integrate our businesses after the Merger, we plan to incur restructuring expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and an additional $400 million in fiscal 2019.\nSeparation Costs\nCosts associated with activities relating to the Separation of NPS during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of $19 million were expensed when incurred. These costs were comprised primarily of third-party accounting, legal and other consulting services. There were no separation costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nInterest expense for fiscal 2017 was $117 million as compared to $123 million in fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense was due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 redemption of our 6.50% term notes and lower interest rates on our existing debt.\nInterest income for fiscal 2017 was $35 million as compared to $38 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average deposit balances in our money market funds and money market deposit accounts during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $123 million as compared to $126 million in fiscal 2015. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates than the prior year, which more than offset the increase in borrowings. Included in interest expense for fiscal 2016 is a write-off of $2 million of deferred costs and discount related to the redemption of the 6.50% term notes due March 2018 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest income for fiscal 2016 was $38 million as compared to $20 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in interest income for fiscal 2016 resulted both from higher interest rates in some of the jurisdictions where we hold balances and principally from increased payments from banks for higher compensating deposit balances in our cash management operations and notional pooling arrangements that are counterbalanced by higher overdraft fees and interest expense.\nDebt Extinguishment Costs\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed all outstanding 6.50% term notes due March 2018 at par plus redemption premiums related to a make-whole provision and accrued interest. We recorded $95 million of debt extinguishment costs within the consolidated statement of operations, which consists primarily of the redemption premiums mentioned above. There were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nOther (income) expense, net comprises movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses. The $1 million year-over-year increase in other income was due to a $7 million year-over-year benefit of favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates used to fair value our foreign currency forward contracts and the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities partially offset by a $6 million gain on sale of certain assets during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nOther (income) expense, net increased by $19 million primarily due to the $12 million benefit of favorable movements in exchange rates and the aforementioned $6 million gain on sale of assets.\nTaxes\nOur effective tax rate (\"ETR\") on income (loss) from continuing operations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was (42.5)%, (620.0)% and (69.2)%, respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 11 - \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2017, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 A change in the valuation allowance that primarily consists of an aggregate income tax detriment for the increase in the valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.S., Germany and Luxembourg, which decreased the overall income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $135 million and 78%, respectively. Offset by an aggregate income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.K., Denmark and Japan, which increased the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $75 million and 43.0%, respectively. \n \u2022 An income tax detriment for transaction costs incurred that are not deductible for tax purposes, which resulted in a decrease to the overall tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $21 million and 12.1%, respectively. \n \u2022 An income tax benefit from excess tax benefits realized from employee share-based payment awards, which resulted in an increase in the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $20 million and 11.3%, respectively. \nIn fiscal 2016, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 The adoption of a new accounting standard on excess tax benefits realized from share options vested or exercised. This increased the overall income tax benefit and the ETR by $23 million and 230%, respectively. \n \u2022 An increase in the overall valuation allowance primarily due to the Separation related to state net operating losses and state tax credits. This decreased the overall income tax benefit and ETR by $27 million and 270%, respectively. \n \u2022 The release of a liability for uncertain tax positions following the closure of the U.K. tax audit for fiscal 2010 to 2012. This increased the income tax benefit by $58 million and increased the ETR by 580%. \n \u2022 Adjustments to uncertain tax positions in the U.S. that increased the overall income tax benefit by $24 million and increased the ETR by 240%, respectively. \nIn fiscal 2015, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 The non-deductible SEC settlement of $190 million, which decreased the income tax benefit and the ETR by $73 million and 10.9%, respectively. \n \u2022 Local losses on investments in Luxembourg increased the foreign rate differential and the ETR by $325 million and 48.4%, respectively, with an offsetting decrease in the ETR due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount. \n \u2022 Changes in valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, including a valuation allowance release in the U.K. The total impact of the valuation allowance release increased the income tax benefit and the ETR by $235 million and 35.0%, respectively. There was a net decrease in valuation allowances in fiscal 2015. \nThe Company entered into negotiations for a resolution of the fiscal 2008 through 2010 U.S. Federal audit through settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. During the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and associated notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe three primary objectives of this discussion are to:\n 1. provide a narrative on the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; \n 2. enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and related notes by providing context to analyze the consolidated financial statements; and \n 3. provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. \nTo achieve these objectives, management's discussion and analysis is presented with the following sections:\nOverview - includes a description of our business and how it earns revenues and generates cash, as well as a discussion of economic and industry factors, key business drivers and key performance indicators.\nResults of Operations - discusses year-over-year changes to operating results for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, describing the factors affecting revenues on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and divestitures and currency impacts; describes the factors affecting changes in our major cost and expense categories and discusses our non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes our liquidity and available capital resources.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - details our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations - details our outstanding contractual obligations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates - discusses our accounting estimates based on management judgments and assumptions which could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nEconomic and Industry Factors\nManagement monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. We are seeing the IT services industry being transformed by a shift in customer demand towards digital services and solutions. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes to deliver industry-leading service offerings is a key driver of our performance.\nOver the past five years we have made key acquisitions in hybrid cloud solutions, digital enterprise applications and insurance and healthcare as well as divested non-core businesses to optimize our service portfolio. We have responded to the industry trends we identified by streamlining our service offerings and implementing a strategy of selling defined solutions that require less customization. Such solutions include our portfolio of cloud-based IaaS offerings, managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing, storage, mobility and networking services.\nBusiness Drivers\nRevenues in both segments are generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenues include our ability to successfully:\n \u2022 bid on and win new contract awards; \n \u2022 satisfy existing customers and obtain add-on business and win contract recompetes; \n \u2022 compete with respect to services offered, delivery models offered, technical ability and innovation, quality, flexibility, global reach, experience and results created; and \n \u2022 identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues. \nEarnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and our ability to:\n \u2022 integrate acquisitions and eliminate redundant costs; \n \u2022 develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore; \n \u2022 control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs; \n \u2022 anticipate talent needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses; \n \u2022 accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals; and \n \u2022 effectively manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations through the use of short-term foreign currency forward and option contracts. \nCash flows are affected by the above drivers and the following factors:\n \u2022 the ability to efficiently manage capital resources and expenditures; \n \u2022 timely management of receivables and payables; \n \u2022 investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and implementations, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts; and \n \u2022 tax obligations. \nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess the performance of our business through various financial measures, primarily new contract wins, revenues and consolidated segment operating margins.\nNew contract wins: In addition to being a primary driver of future revenues, new contract wins also provide management an assessment of our ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or recompeted contracts, as well as numerous external factors.\nRevenues: Amounts recognized as earned from contracts won in prior periods and additional work secured in the current year. Year-over-year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenues.\nConsolidated segment operating margins: Reflect performance on our contracts and ability to control its costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenues can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of our costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes us to additional margin fluctuations.\nResults of Operations\nWe report our results based on a fiscal year convention that comprises four thirteen-week quarters. Every fifth year includes an additional week in the first three months of the fiscal year to prevent the fiscal year from moving from an approximate end of March date. Fiscal 2015 was the last year which included the additional week.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed the Separation of NPS and merger of NPS with SRA International, Inc. to form a new publicly traded company, CSRA Inc. As a result of the Separation, the consolidated statements of operations and related financial information reflect NPS's operations as discontinued operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015.\nThe following table provides an analysis for select line items of the consolidated statements of operations:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per-share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations, before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues by segment are shown in the tables below:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fiscal 2017 revenues increased $501 million as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth in our GBS segment and revenues from our recent acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2017 revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $317 million caused by contracts that concluded or were renewed at lower rates and a $221 million adverse impact of foreign currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound.\nOur fiscal 2016 revenues decreased $1.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues caused by contract terminations, conclusions and contractual price reductions of $644 million and the adverse impact of foreign currency movement of $467 million, partially offset by a $100 million increase due to acquisitions.\nAs a global company, historically, more than half of our revenues have been earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, the changes in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period are impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As such, the following discussion contains financial results on a constant currency basis eliminating the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby providing meaningful period over period comparisons of operating performance. Financial results on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP measures calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period's currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends.\nThe tables below indicate the percentage change in revenues due to changes in exchange rates:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Years Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 vs. April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase at Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nImpact of\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Net Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Years Ended\nApril 1, 2016 vs. April 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease at Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nImpact of\nCurrency Fluctuations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Net Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nThe discussion below explains the reasons for revenue changes other than as a result of foreign currency fluctuations.\nGlobal Business Services\nThe $654 million, or 18.0%, constant currency increase for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in next generation business processing services offerings, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, primarily within our Digital Applications business and our IS&S business where we continue to prioritize the development of our digital capabilities. Digital Applications, our consulting and applications business, increased over 38% in constant currency and IS&S increased over 26% in constant currency when compared to prior fiscal year. The increase was largely due to revenues from our recent acquisitions which we continue to integrate into our existing business and new business revenues increased $249 million. These increases were partially offset by a $274 million decrease in revenues from contracts that concluded and a $131 million decline from contracts renewed at lower rates.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment constant currency revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $68 million, or 2.0%, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $243 million in revenues from new business and an increase in revenues contributed from our recent acquisitions. In addition, we recognized incremental revenues of $43 million under our segment's portion of the IP matters agreement (see note 3 - \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements). These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of $335 million from contracts that concluded, $89 million from contracts renewed with scope changes and $23 million due to price-downs. We continue to take actions to mitigate the secular headwinds facing our traditional IT outsourcing business and focus GIS on the next generation digital needs of our clients.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nGlobal Business Services\nGBS segment revenues decreased $399 million, or 9.9%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $154 million, or 3.8%, which was an improvement as compared to the fiscal 2015 revenues decrease in constant currency of 4.7%. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $245 million, or 61.4% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. The revenue decrease in constant currency included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016.\nIncluded in fiscal 2016 revenues is acquisition revenues of $65 million from the acquisition of Fruition Partners, Axon, and UXC, which were completed late in the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services\nGIS segment revenues decreased $612 million, or 15.0%, as compared to fiscal 2015. In constant currency, revenues decreased $390 million, or 9.6%, due to reduced revenues from contracts that terminated or concluded as well as an unfavorable impact from price-downs and contract restructurings. It also included revenues from the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which did not recur in fiscal 2016. These revenue decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from new contracts and acquisitions. The increase in revenues due to acquisitions totaled $35 million from Fixnetix and UXC completed late in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. The unfavorable foreign currency impact of $222 million, or 36.3% of the year-over-year decrease, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur total costs and expenses were as follows:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative (excludes depreciation and amortization, SEC settlement related charges and restructuring costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative - SEC settlement related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Services\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nCOS as a percentage of revenues (\"COS ratio\") remained consistent year over year. The $360 million increase in costs of services, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges (\"COS\") was largely related to our acquisitions and a $31 million gain on the sale of certain intangible assets in our GIS segment during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year. This increase was offset by management's ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a year-over-year favorable change of $28 million to pension and other post-retirement benefit (\"OPEB\") actuarial and settlement losses associated with our defined benefit pension plans. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $219 million and $7 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nThe net reduction in COS was a result of management's cost reduction initiatives, including reduced headcount, that sought to align our cost structure with business needs. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recognized $100 million and $525 million, respectively, of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses in COS. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $7 million and $248 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe COS ratio decreased to 73.0% for fiscal 2016 from 76.0% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the COS ratio for fiscal 2016 was due to the reduction in revenues and the $425 million year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of actuarial and pension settlement losses. This decrease was partially offset by a gain of $31 million on the sale of certain intangible assets and other COS decreases.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, SEC settlement related charges and restructuring charges (\"SG&A ratio\"), increased 2.2% to 16.8% for fiscal 2017 from 14.6% for fiscal 2016. The increase was due to transaction and integration costs of $305 million associated with our recent acquisitions and the Merger, an increase of $16 million in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses and a non-recurring settlement recovery of $16 million recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") during fiscal 2016, not present in the current fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by higher revenues. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we recognized $15 million and $(1) million, respectively, of actuarial and pension settlement losses (gains) in SG&A. The amount of restructuring charges, net of adjustments, excluded from SG&A was $19 million and $16 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nSG&A expense, excluding restructuring charges of $16 million and $8 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a percentage of revenues, decreased slightly to 14.6% for fiscal 2016 from 15.0% for fiscal 2015. The SG&A ratio for fiscal 2016 was impacted by the year-over-year favorable change in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses. We recognized no actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A during fiscal 2016. Comparatively, during fiscal 2015, we recognized $59 million of actuarial and pension settlement losses in SG&A, resulting from the remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans.\nExcluding the impact of the pension adjustments described above, the SG&A ratio increased 0.3% for fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015. The increase in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the reduction in revenues, which more than offset the decrease in SG&A. The lower SG&A costs during fiscal 2016 were primarily the result of management's cost reduction initiatives that sought to align our cost structure with business needs and a settlement recovery of $16 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative - SEC Settlement Related Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015, we reached an understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding a settlement of a formal civil investigation by the SEC that commenced during fiscal 2012 and covered a range of matters as previously disclosed, including certain of our prior disclosures and accounting determinations. As part of our understanding with the staff of the SEC regarding terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a penalty of $190 million and to implement a review of our compliance policies through an independent compliance consultant. We recorded pre-tax charges of $197 million for the penalty and related expenses in fiscal 2015. See Note 22 - \"Settlement of SEC Investigation\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nDepreciation and amortization (\"D&A\") as a percentage of revenues decreased less than 1% to 8.5% for fiscal 2017 from 9.3% for fiscal 2016 due to an increase in revenues for the GBS segment and lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of reduced capital expenditures from contract terminations, as well as a continued focus on capital efficiency. The decrease in the D&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to our recent acquisitions, primarily within the GBS segment.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nD&A as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.3% for fiscal 2016 from 10.3% for fiscal 2015. The decrease in the ratio was primarily driven by lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of lower capital expenditures and sale of contract assets to customers where contracts had concluded.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments. During fiscal 2017 we initiated restructuring actions in certain areas to realign our cost structure and resources to take advantage of operational efficiencies following recent acquisitions and in anticipation of the Merger. Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, were largely the result of implementing workforce reductions. Under our Fiscal 2016 Plan our objective was to optimize utilization of facilities and right size overhead organizations as a result of the Separation. Our objective under our Fiscal 2015 plan was to reduce headcount in order to align resources to support business needs, accelerate efforts to optimize the workforce in high cost markets, particularly in Europe, address our labor pyramid and right-shore our labor mix.\nTotal restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $238 million, $23 million and $256 million, respectively. Fiscal 2015 restructuring costs included a special restructuring charge of $241 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The net amounts recorded included $6 million, $7 million and $3 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years. The remaining liabilities under the Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 plans were paid or reversed during fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, as we integrate our businesses after the Merger, we plan to incur restructuring expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and an additional $400 million in fiscal 2019.\nSeparation Costs\nCosts associated with activities relating to the Separation of NPS during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of $19 million were expensed when incurred. These costs were comprised primarily of third-party accounting, legal and other consulting services. There were no separation costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nInterest expense for fiscal 2017 was $117 million as compared to $123 million in fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense was due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 redemption of our 6.50% term notes and lower interest rates on our existing debt.\nInterest income for fiscal 2017 was $35 million as compared to $38 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average deposit balances in our money market funds and money market deposit accounts during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $123 million as compared to $126 million in fiscal 2015. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates than the prior year, which more than offset the increase in borrowings. Included in interest expense for fiscal 2016 is a write-off of $2 million of deferred costs and discount related to the redemption of the 6.50% term notes due March 2018 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest income for fiscal 2016 was $38 million as compared to $20 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in interest income for fiscal 2016 resulted both from higher interest rates in some of the jurisdictions where we hold balances and principally from increased payments from banks for higher compensating deposit balances in our cash management operations and notional pooling arrangements that are counterbalanced by higher overdraft fees and interest expense.\nDebt Extinguishment Costs\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed all outstanding 6.50% term notes due March 2018 at par plus redemption premiums related to a make-whole provision and accrued interest. We recorded $95 million of debt extinguishment costs within the consolidated statement of operations, which consists primarily of the redemption premiums mentioned above. There were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2015.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nFiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016\nOther (income) expense, net comprises movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses. The $1 million year-over-year increase in other income was due to a $7 million year-over-year benefit of favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates used to fair value our foreign currency forward contracts and the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities partially offset by a $6 million gain on sale of certain assets during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year.\nFiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015\nOther (income) expense, net increased by $19 million primarily due to the $12 million benefit of favorable movements in exchange rates and the aforementioned $6 million gain on sale of assets.\nTaxes\nOur effective tax rate (\"ETR\") on income (loss) from continuing operations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was (42.5)%, (620.0)% and (69.2)%, respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 11 - \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2017, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 A change in the valuation allowance that primarily consists of an aggregate income tax detriment for the increase in the valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.S., Germany and Luxembourg, which decreased the overall income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $135 million and 78%, respectively. Offset by an aggregate income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.K., Denmark and Japan, which increased the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $75 million and 43.0%, respectively. \n \u2022 An income tax detriment for transaction costs incurred that are not deductible for tax purposes, which resulted in a decrease to the overall tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $21 million and 12.1%, respectively. \n \u2022 An income tax benefit from excess tax benefits realized from employee share-based payment awards, which resulted in an increase in the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $20 million and 11.3%, respectively. \nIn fiscal 2016, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 The adoption of a new accounting standard on excess tax benefits realized from share options vested or exercised. This increased the overall income tax benefit and the ETR by $23 million and 230%, respectively. \n \u2022 An increase in the overall valuation allowance primarily due to the Separation related to state net operating losses and state tax credits. This decreased the overall income tax benefit and ETR by $27 million and 270%, respectively. \n \u2022 The release of a liability for uncertain tax positions following the closure of the U.K. tax audit for fiscal 2010 to 2012. This increased the income tax benefit by $58 million and increased the ETR by 580%. \n \u2022 Adjustments to uncertain tax positions in the U.S. that increased the overall income tax benefit by $24 million and increased the ETR by 240%, respectively. \nIn fiscal 2015, the ETR was primarily impacted by:\n \u2022 The non-deductible SEC settlement of $190 million, which decreased the income tax benefit and the ETR by $73 million and 10.9%, respectively. \n \u2022 Local losses on investments in Luxembourg increased the foreign rate differential and the ETR by $325 million and 48.4%, respectively, with an offsetting decrease in the ETR due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount. \n \u2022 Changes in valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, including a valuation allowance release in the U.K. The total impact of the valuation allowance release increased the income tax benefit and the ETR by $235 million and 35.0%, respectively. There was a net decrease in valuation allowances in fiscal 2015. \nThe Company entered into negotiations for a resolution of the fiscal 2008 through 2010 U.S. Federal audit through settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. During the"}
