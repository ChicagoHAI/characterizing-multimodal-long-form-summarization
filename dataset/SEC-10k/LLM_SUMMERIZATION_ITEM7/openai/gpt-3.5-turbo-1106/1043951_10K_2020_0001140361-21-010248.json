The Trust is a successor to the Campbell Fund Limited Partnership (formerly known as the Commodity Trend Fund) which began trading operations in January 1972. The Trust currently trades in the U.S. and international futures, forward and centrally cleared swap markets under the sole direction of Campbell & Company, LP, the managing operator of the Trust. Specifically, the Trust trades in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies, credit and commodities. The Trust is an actively managed account with speculative trading profits as its objective.\nEffective August 31, 2008, the Trust began offering Series A, Series B, and Series W Units. The units in the Trust prior to that date became Series B Units. Series B Units are only available for additional investment by existing holders of Series B Units. Effective August 1, 2017, the Trust began offering Series D units.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate capitalization of the Trust was $279,565,692 with Series A, Series B, Series D and Series W comprising $216,523,843, $32,296,756, $5,043,054 and $25,702,039, respectively, of the total. The Net Asset Value per Unit was $2,579.95 for Series A, $2,837.78 for Series B, $1,059.92 for Series D and $3,112.12 for Series W.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the Financial Statements.\nThe Trust records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements of Operations. Generally, fair values are based on market prices; however, in certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price (i.e., forward contracts which are traded in the inter-bank market).\nCapital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Trust generally maintains 60% to 75% of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. After redemptions and additions are taken into account each month, the trade levels of the Trust are adjusted and positions in the instruments the Trust trades are added or liquidated on a pro-rata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels.\nLiquidity\nMost United States futures exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as \"daily price fluctuation limits\" or \"daily limits.\" During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Trust from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Trust to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Trust may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Trust's futures trading operations, the Trust's assets are expected to be highly liquid.\nThe entire offering proceeds, without deductions, will be credited to the Trust's bank, custodial and/or cash management accounts. The Trust meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash and U.S. government securities with the futures broker and the over-the-counter counterparty. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures, forward and swap contracts. The Trust receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Trust assets.\nApproximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury Bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 5% to 15% of the Trust's assets are deposited with the over-the-counter counterparty or centrally cleared in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparty.\nThe managing operator deposits the majority of those assets of the Trust that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in a custodial account with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial account with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial account constitutes approximately 60% to 75% of the Trust's assets and are invested directly by PNC Capital Advisors, LLC (\"PNC\"). PNC is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. PNC does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Trust's assets in the custodial account. PNC invest the assets according to agreed upon investment guidelines that first preserve capital, second allow for sufficient liquidity, and third provide a yield beyond the risk-free rate. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt; and (iv) Asset Backed Securities.\nThe Trust occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparty, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody account at Northern Trust Company to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Trust has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.\nThe Trust's assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell & Company or any affiliated entities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term \"off-balance sheet risk\" refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Trust trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Trust, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Trust at the same time, and if the Trust's trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Trust, the Trust could lose all of its assets and the Unitholders would realize a 100% loss. Campbell & Company, the managing operator (who also acts as trading advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30% however, these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk of loss.\nIn addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and swap contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Trust. The counterparty for futures contracts and centrally cleared swap contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.\nIn the case of forward contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Campbell & Company trades for the Trust only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Trust are valued each day at fair value. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Trust.\nDisclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value\nThe Trust invests in futures, forward currency, and centrally cleared swap contracts. The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of centrally cleared swap contracts is determined by using currency market quotations provided by an independent external pricing source.\nResults of Operations\nThe returns for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 for Series A were 0.46%, 7.75% and (9.03)%, Series B were 0.97%, 8.29% and (8.66)%, Series D were 1.73%, 7.79% and (8.15)% and Series W were 2.50%, 9.93% and (7.28)% respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued management fees in the amounts of $8,472,866, $12,792,990, and $16,863,539, respectively, and paid management fees in the amounts of $8,990,885, $12,901,756, and $17,499,643, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued sales commissions in the amounts of $2,990,891, $0, and $0, respectively, and paid sales commissions in the amounts of $2,573,244, $0, and $0, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $0, respectively, and paid performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $3,207.\n2020 (For the Year Ended December 31)\nOf the 0.46% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series A, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.67)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series A.\nOf the 0.97% return for year ended December 31, 2020 for Series B, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.16)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions and operating costs borne by Series B.\nOf the 1.73% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series D, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (4.40)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series D.\nOf the 2.50% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series W, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (3.63)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series W.\nAn analysis of the 5.03% gross trading losses for the Trust for the year by sector is as follows:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> Sector\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.08\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.33\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.63\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Indices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12.32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust had a strong start to 2020 with gains coming from interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange positions, while stock index holdings provided some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia, Europe, and the United States benefited as prices advanced on a flight to safety bid sparked by the worsening Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. A short position on the Canadian 10-year note created some partially offsetting losses, which were accelerated by downward pressure on yields prompted by a dovish shift by Bank of Canada policymakers. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust in January, with the energy sub-sector realizing the best results. Short positioning on natural gas proved profitable as milder weather across the US weighed on demand prospects. Additional gains were generated from short industrial metal holdings. The base metal complex traded weaker as the coronavirus epidemic raised investor concerns about its negative impact on the Chinese economy. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong dollar as well as technical selling. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed market currencies. Short positions on the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits. The commodity-linked currencies came under pressure as commodity prices sold-off on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials. A long Brazilian real holding produced some partially offsetting losses after risk fell out of favor and investors sold emerging market currencies. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during January. Long positioning across most global stock indexes profited early in the month amid the ratification of the phase one\u201d US-China trade deal, renewed central bank balance sheet expansion, Brexit clarity, and some better than expected US earnings releases. However, profits were relinquished in the second-half of the month as stocks traded lower following risk-off trading as the coronavirus outbreak intensified.\nGains from interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity positions led to a profitable February for the Trust, while stock index holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia and the United States continued to benefit as prices advanced on flight to safety buying sparked by the worsening COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic. Investors aggressively sought the safety of fixed income instruments, sending global yields tumbling and expectations for further central bank stimulus soaring. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed and emerging market currencies. Short positions on the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits for the sector. These commodity-linked currencies came under renewed selling pressure during February. The widening spread of COVID-19 to countries outside of China, such as Japan, South Korea, and Italy, sparked new concerns that global economic growth would slow materially, thus blunting the demand for raw materials. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 outbreak is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during February with the greatest declines seen in Australia, Japan, and the United States. Long positioning across most global stock indexes generally profited during the first two-thirds of the month. However, late in February global stock indexes experienced steep sell-offs sparked by the coronavirus's quick spread to countries outside of China where it initially began. World economic growth fears and supply chain disruption concerns spread rapidly, sending most global stock indexes sharply lower.\nThe Trust had an unprofitable March, with losses coming from stock index and interest rate holdings, while foreign exchange and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Global stock index trading produced the largest losses for the Trust, with the greatest declines seen in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Long positioning across most global stock indexes suffered severely as equity indexes experienced very sharp sell-offs during the month. The COVID-19 virus spread quickly throughout Europe and North America prompting containment measures in the form of stay at home\u201d directives, closures, and shutdowns that sharply curtailed economic activity. Global central banks and governments took unprecedented steps in an effort to soften the financial impact from the virus, but fear over the length and depth of the growth slowdown sent risky assets sharply lower. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed small additional losses during the month. Short positioning on US 10-year notes and US long bonds suffered amid the flight-to-safety scramble that ensued due to the severe economic upheaval wrought by the COVID-19 virus. Long positioning across global short-dated instruments helped to partially offset losses within the sector. Profits were dominated by short positions on the commodity currencies (versus long the USD), specifically in the Norwegian krone. The US dollar was sharply higher during the month amid the extreme flight-to-quality moves. Adding further downward pressure on oil-linked currencies, the petroleum markets sold off severely when tensions escalated between OPEC and Russia, and Saudi Arabia made the decision to ramp up production. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 pandemic is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling.\nThe Trust's losses in April came from foreign exchange and interest rate holdings, while stock index and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Short positioning on several of the developed market currencies, namely the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied on a partial lifting of COVID-19 containment measures in those countries. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed additional losses to the portfolio. Long positions on Australian 10-year bonds suffered after the RBA tapered bond-buying operations and the country became one of the first to meaningfully ease lockdown restrictions. Short German Bund positions added to losses as Germany's debt rallied versus periphery European bonds with Germany weathering the effects of COVID-19 better than their Eurozone counterparts. Stock indexes rebounded considerably from the oversold conditions seen during March as the United States and other countries laid out plans to reopen their economies from the COVID-19 lockdown that has proven to be very damaging to local, regional, and global economic growth. The Trust held a mixture of long and short positioning across global stock indexes during the month. Ultimately the gains on long positions more than offset losses experienced on any short holdings, leading to positive net P&L within the sector. Commodity holdings produced additional partially offsetting profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the petroleum complex produced a bulk of the sector's profits. Crude oil sold off sharply on the lethal combination of COVID-19 stay at home\u201d induced demand destruction linked with a shortage of available storage capacity. The May WTI futures contract went below zero for the first time in history as long holders scrambled to sell before contract expiration in order to avoid taking physical delivery given the scarcity of demand and lack of available storage space.\nLosses in May once again came from foreign exchange, as well as commodity and stock index holdings, while interest rate positions contributed some gains. May's short positioning on several of the so-called commodity currencies, namely the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied strongly. Fueling the run-up was a sharp rebound in many beaten down commodity markets, specifically the energy complex, as optimism grew that the worst of the COVID-19 crisis was over. A long position on the Canadian dollar (versus short the US dollar) contributed some partially offsetting gains for the sector on the same commodity currency drivers cited above. Commodity holdings produced additional losses for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the energy, grain, and industrial metal complexes showed losses as those markets rallied driven by the improving COVID-19 crisis. A long holding on precious metals, specifically silver, produced some partially offsetting gains for the sector as expected industrial demand overwhelmed limited supplies of the metal. Short positioning on stock indexes in Europe and Japan suffered as most global stock indices continued to bounce higher from the March COVID-19 crisis lows. Regional economic re-openings linked with no new major spikes in coronavirus cases fueled the equity optimism. A long position on the Hong Kong Hang Seng index added to sector losses as that market was one of the few global indexes to sell-off during May. China's legislature approved a proposal to impose a highly contentious national security law in the semi-autonomous territory which sparked the regional equity sell-off. Interest rate positions from both long and short-dated instruments contributed partially offsetting gains to the Trust in May. A short position on the German 10-year note was one of the most profitable markets in the sector. The German Bund sold-off during the month (prices lower and yields higher) as signs of improvement in the coronavirus crisis caused traders to shun safe haven assets in favor of riskier ones.\nForeign exchange trading in both the emerging and developed markets produced losses for the Trust during June. The greatest declines were seen in the Norwegian krone, Australian dollar, and certain Latin American currencies. These commodity-linked currencies strengthened to start the month, causing some strategies to cover their previously held long positions, only to reverse those moves later in June. The investor exuberance over additional government stimulus and the economic re-openings quickly wore off on reports of increasing COVID-19 infection outbreaks. Short soft commodity and industrial metal holdings suffered as the dollar weakened early in the month and as optimism over a rapid recovery in economic growth bolstered prices. Short grain positions produced losses on the last trading day of the month as the grain complex rallied sharply after the USDA reported acreage that trailed estimates. Within the energy sub-sector, a short natural gas holding provided some offsetting gains amid plummeting US gas exports as well as shifting weather and market supply dynamics. Meanwhile, stock index trading generated some offsetting gains. The Trust held a mix of long and short positions across the traded universe of indexes and showed a gain in Asia and North America, but partially offsetting losses were realized in Europe. Most global indexes experienced a choppy month amid mixed coronavirus news coupled with hopes for more stimulus from central banks. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments also contributed small offsetting gains during the month. The Bank of Japan signaled plans to buy more shorter-maturity bonds which caused the yield curve to steepen and benefited our short positioning on longer-dated Japanese government bonds.\nJuly saw losses for the Trust, driven primarily from stock index holdings and foreign exchange trading in the emerging and developed markets. The United States' inability to get the COVID-19 virus under control in the face of other nations of the world seemingly better able to handle the crisis generated concern that US economic growth would lag other countries, leading the FOMC to keep highly accommodative monetary easing in place longer. This dichotomy weakened the US dollar to two-year lows hurting the Trust's long US dollar positioning against many other currencies. Stock index trading also generated losses for the Trust during July. Long positioning, primarily in Asia-Pacific and Europe, produced the bulk of the sector's decline. Late in the month both the Asia-Pacific and European regions began to see an uptick in COVID-19 virus cases. Regional governments were quick to discuss the possibility of once again needing to shutdown economies to halt the spread which led to rapid risk-off sentiment in equity markets leading to lower prices. Commodity trading generated the best partially offsetting profits for the Trust. Long positioning on silver and gold proved profitable as both metals showed strong monthly gains. The aforementioned drivers of US dollar weakness were the primary cause of precious metal subsector gains. Some partially offsetting losses came from the grain and energy subsectors. Short grain holdings generated losses as the grain complex rallied during the month on poor crop conditions in the US Plains. Short positioning on natural gas suffered as high summer electric demand in the US sparked high price volatility that the systematic models failed to trade profitably. Interest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments also contributed gains during July. Long positioning on fixed income instruments profited as prices rose (yields fell) amid US/Chinese geopolitical tensions and as high uncertainty over the course of the COVID-19 crisis led to demand for safe haven assets.\nInterest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments contributed some of the largest losses for the Trust during August. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments suffered as prices fell (yields rose). The COVID-19 crisis and related emergency fiscal spending has created the need for many governments around the world to finance this spending with new and, in some cases, record levels of debt issuance. That issuance put downward pressure on most global sovereign bond instruments which created losses for the Trust. Commodity trading also experienced sizeable losses for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated large losses as that commodity rose over 30% during the month. Hot temperatures across the United States drove demand for natural gas for electricity generation to power air conditioning while inventory data showed storage at lower than expected levels. Some partially offsetting gains were experienced in long industrial metals positioning. Longs on copper and nickel profited as prices rose amid signs of a global supply shortage in the face of rising demand from countries such as China. Stock index trading generated partially offsetting gains for the Trust during August. Long positioning, especially in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany, produced profits as indexes in those countries experienced strong gains. A lessening of COVID-19 infections, signs that some governments were less willing to renew economic shutdowns to manage the virus crisis, and ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus actions were all supportive of global stocks during the month. Lastly, foreign exchange trading contributed small additional gains during the month. Losses in emerging FX markets were more than offset by gains in developed FX positions, leading to a net profit within the asset class.\nThe Trust showed a small loss in September, with interest rate positions from long-dated securities once again contributing some of the largest Trust profits during September. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments gained as prices rose (yields fell). September had a pronounced risk-off tone that benefitted fixed income holdings due to their attractive safe haven qualities. Overbought conditions in US tech stocks, a lack of progress on another US fiscal stimulus package, some signs that the global economic recovery was stalling, US Presidential election uncertainty, and signs that a new wave of COVID-19 cases was emerging in a variety of regions around the globe all led to the general risk-off malaise. Commodity trading also added gains for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated profits as that market fell over 10% during the month. Swelling inventories linked with cooler temperatures in much of the United States were the catalyst to lower natural gas prices. A short position on gasoil also proved profitable amid anemic demand as the COVID-19 pandemic crimped diesel fuel purchases. Some partially offsetting losses were experienced in long industrial metal and long grain holdings. Prices in these two subsectors were depressed during the month by a strengthening US dollar on flight to safety buying. Foreign exchange trading contributed small losses during the month. Gains in emerging FX markets were more than offset by losses in developed FX positions, leading to a small net loss within the asset class. Stock index trading generated the largest losses for the Trust during September. Long positioning, especially in Europe, Australia, the UK, and Canada, produced losses as indexes in those countries declined amid the risk-off environment that dominated the month. Fresh virus outbreaks in the UK and Europe linked with concerns that the UK and the European Union were headed for a \"no deal\" Brexit weighed on equities in those countries. Falling commodity markets due to US dollar strength and concern over global growth prospects depressed equities in Australia and Canada.\nThe Trust showed a gain in October with profits coming from commodity and FX positions, while stock index and interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Commodity trading drove gains for the Trust. Long positioning on the industrial metals complex profited as prices rallied across the subsector with strengthening fundamentals outweighing concerns over a new wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the US. Nickel led monthly gains as multiple typhoons in the Philippines threatened exports and COVID-induced mine closures dented supply. Long holdings on the soft commodities also proved profitable. Sugar and cotton both advanced on poor crop conditions driven by adverse weather in their respective growing regions. Foreign exchange trading contributed additional profits during October. Gains were concentrated in emerging FX markets. Short positioning on the Polish Zloty (versus long US dollar) profited amid renewed COVID-19 lockdown measures across Europe. Long holdings on the Korean won and Chinese renminbi (versus short US dollar) experienced gains as both currencies appreciated due to improving economic growth as many Asian countries maintained better control over new COVID-19 outbreaks. Stock index trading generated the largest partially offsetting losses for the Trust. Regionally, stock index performance varied widely and many indexes experienced volatile price action amid a cross current of news and events. European indices saw steep losses and to a lesser extent so did US indexes, while many markets in Asia actually produced gains. This varied and erratic price action proved difficult for the Trust's systematic trading systems to successfully navigate. Interest rate positions also contributed losses during the month with declines most pronounced in short-dated instruments. Short positioning on European short-end paper was hurt as prices advanced after a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in the region prompted flight-to-safety buying as governments announced new lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the viral outbreak.\nThe Trust showed a gain in November with profits coming from stock index, commodity, and credit positions, while interest rate and FX holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning on global stock indexes drove profits for the Trust during November. Stock markets around the globe started the month strong after the US presidential and congressional election results indicated a divided government in the US and as concerns over a disputed presidential election result began to fade. Bull market optimism continued through the second half of the month as several pharmaceutical companies reported promising results from COVID-19 vaccine trials. Commodity trading also generated gains. Long grain holdings were additive to the Trust with the soy complex providing the largest gains. Soy prices advanced on a bearish supply outlook and expectations that Chinese demand for soybeans will climb next year. Long positioning on the industrial metals complex also generated gains, driven by a weaker US dollar and improving Chinese economic data which sparked a rally as base metal demand expectations improved. In credit trading, short protection positions generated gains as US and European credit spreads narrowed on the same risk-on drivers that drove global stocks higher during the month. Interest rate positions contributed losses during November with declines most pronounced in long-dated instruments. Long positioning on Australian and UK 10-year notes were hurt as yields surged (prices fell) as the flight-to-safety bid dried up following encouraging announcements from COVID-19 vaccine trials. The absence of US election surprises also saw the US long bond sell-off (yields rose) which generated a loss for long positioning on that market as well FX trading contributing small additional losses during November. Losses were realized from trading both the developed and emerging FX markets against the US dollar, which continued its long-term bear trend lower during the month.\nThe Trust showed a gain in December with profits coming from commodity, stock index, FX, and credit positions, while interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Commodity trading drove profits for the Trust during December. Long holdings on the soy complex produced the best results within the sector. Soybeans and related products rallied to multiyear highs on dry weather in key growing regions as Chinese demand continues to rise. Long positioning on the precious metals, softs, and industrial metals generated gains driven by a weaker US dollar and expectations for improving global demand. A short position on natural gas added to profits as warmer weather and abundant supply pushed prices lower in the second half of the month. Long positioning on global stock indexes also generated gains amid a risk-on environment. Stock markets around the globe mostly rallied as COVID-19 vaccines began to be distributed, the US Congress passed a long-awaited COVID fiscal stimulus package that President Trump signed into law, and as the UK and European Union came to a settlement on a Brexit separation agreement late in the month. In credit trading, short protection positions generated gains as US and European credit spreads narrowed on the same risk-on drivers that drove most global stocks higher. Foreign exchange trading contributed additional gains during December. Profits were realized from trading both the emerging and developed FX markets against the US dollar, which continued its long-term bear trend lower during the month. Interest rate positions produced some partially offsetting losses during the month with declines most pronounced in long-dated instruments. Short positioning in UK and German 10-year notes suffered as Brexit uncertainty throughout the month pushed prices higher (yields fell). Long positioning in Australian fixed income instruments and US Treasuries also created losses as prices fell (yields rose) with encouraging vaccine news and prospects for US fiscal stimulus outweighing increasing COVID cases.\n2019 (For the Year Ended December 31)\nOf the 7.75% return for the year ended December 31, 2019 for Series A, approximately 10.78% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 2.59% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.62)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series A.\nOf the 8.29% return for year ended December 31, 2019 for Series B, approximately 10.78% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 2.59% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.08)% due to brokerage fees, management fees and operating costs borne by Series B.\nOf the 7.79% return for the year ended December 31, 2019 for Series D, approximately 10.78% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 2.59% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.58)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, performance fees, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series D.\nOf the 9.93% return for the year ended December 31, 2019 for Series W, approximately 10.78% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 2.59% due to investment income, offset by approximately (3.44)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series W.\nAn analysis of the 10.78% gross trading losses for the Trust for the year by sector is as follows:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> Sector\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.88\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Indices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.78\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.78\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust was lower in January with losses coming from commodity and foreign exchange positions, while fixed income and stock holdings produced partially offsetting gains for the Trust. Commodity trading generated losses for the Trust in January. Short energy positions suffered as the complex rebounded from multi-year lows on back of bullish fundamental developments and a general increase in risk sentiment. Short grain positioning also detracted as the sector traded higher amid adverse weather conditions in key growing regions, and some optimism surrounding the latest round of trade talks between the US and China. Foreign exchange positioning produced additional losses, with gains in long emerging market currencies (versus the USD) being overshadowed by losses in the developed markets, where we were net short against the greenback. The USD was broadly weaker on the month with the notable themes being the US government shutdown and a less hawkish FOMC. Short positioning on several of the commodity currencies produced the largest losses as those currencies rallied on back of the increase in prices across the petroleum complex during the month. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments provided offsetting profits during the month. Long positioning on bonds issued by Australia, Canada, and France generated the largest gains. The shift in central bank rhetoric to a more dovish tone caused global fixed income markets to rise to start the year. Stock index positions also produced some offsetting gains during the month. Despite a myriad of global headwinds, stock markets recovered from their December sell-off, encouraged by a resumption of trade talks, dovish Fed takeaways, and the start of US Q4 earnings that mostly met expectations. Shorter term strategies moved from short to long, flipping net Trust positioning in time to capitalize on rallying equity markets, especially in the Hang Seng index.\nThe Trust showed a profit in February with gains coming from commodity and stock index positions, while interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Foreign Exchange (FX) had little P&L impact on the Trust during the month. Commodity trading generated profits for the Trust in February. Short positioning across the grain subsector produced some of the best sector gains. Wheat extended a sell-off to a ten-month low following a year-over-year improvement in winter crop conditions. A long position on palladium led gains in the precious metals subsector. Palladium rose to a record high amid tight supplies and steadily rising demand for the rare metal. Some partially offsetting losses came from the industrial metal subsector. Short positioning on copper and nickel suffered as prices rose, driven by signs of progress on US / Chinese trade talks and amid tight supplies. Stock index positions produced additional gains. Long positioning on European, US, and Asia-Pacific indices produced the best profits within the sector. European stock indices benefitted from signs of progress for a successful Brexit (the UK divorce from the European Union) with the Euro Stoxx 50 and the French CAC 40 producing some of the greatest sector returns. Asia-Pacific stocks rallied amid signs that a US / Chinese trade deal was also making positive progress. President Trump delayed a March 1st tariff increase on China as he cited significant progress\u201d on the trade talks. Some of the biggest gains within the region came from Australia and Hong Kong. Interest rate positions from both long-dated and short-dated instruments provided some partially offsetting losses during the month. Long positioning on the United Kingdom (UK) gilt (10-year note) contributed the largest losses to the sector. Signs of positive progress on Brexit and hawkish comments from the UK central bank head Mark Carney conspired to send gilt prices down sharply from near-term highs. In the foreign exchange sector, gains in developed market currencies were almost equally offset by losses in the emerging market currencies, leading to negligible P&L for currencies overall. Long US dollar positioning was profitable against developed market currencies but losses in the emerging markets, especially from the Brazilian real and the South African rand, mostly negated any FX sector gains.\nThe Trust showed a profit in March with gains coming from interest rate and stock index holdings. Foreign exchange positions produced some partially offsetting losses while commodities had little impact on the Trust. Interest rate positions in long- and short-dated instruments spearheaded Trust gains in March. More dovish than expected commentary from central bankers, growing global growth concerns, and persistently weak economic data ignited a sharp rally in bonds worldwide. Long positioning on the UK gilt provided the biggest gain as investors sought safe havens amidst Brexit gridlock. Net long positioning in US bonds generated additional gains after the FOMC scaled back projected interest-rate increases this year to zero and said they would end the drawdown of the central bank bond holdings in September. One of the most discussed bond headlines this month was the inversion of the US yield curve (3-month bills and 10-year note) for the first time since the global financial crisis. Long positioning on a variety of global stock indices also added to the positive monthly result. Stock index returns ebbed and flowed on the various themes of stalling global economy growth, dovish central bank rhetoric, US-China trade talks, and Brexit. Some of the best monthly stock index gains were found in Europe and the United States. Foreign exchange positioning on developed FX markets drove the sector's losses during the month. The Trust started the month long the Canadian dollar (versus the USD) which ultimately weakened after a worse than expected Canadian GDP release. Small gains in the emerging market currencies helped offset some of the losses. Commodity holdings produced mixed results in March. Long energy positions detracted as upside momentum in the complex stalled alongside a pause in global risk sentiment. Precious metals also registered a negative contribution to the Trust, primarily from a long palladium position. After hitting new all-time highs, palladium prices plummeted in the waning days of the month as slowing global economic growth sparked demand worries. Short grains holdings provided offsetting gains as the complex sold-off into month-end following a bearish USDA grain report.\nThe Trust showed a profit in April, with gains coming from stock index and commodity positions, while interest rate and foreign exchange holdings produced some partially offsetting losses during the month. Stock index positions produced the best Trust gains. Long positioning on European and Asia-Pacific indexes generated the largest profits within the sector. Global stock indexes generally produced strong gains during April. Those gains were driven by dovish statements from several major central banks, signs of improving economic growth from China, some better-than-expected economic releases from the United States, and amid mostly robust Q1 corporate earnings reports. Commodity trading also generated profits for the Trust in April. Short positioning across the grain subsector produced some of the best sector gains driven by a stronger US dollar and ample global supply expectations. Soybeans traded to a 6-month low while wheat fell to a 6-week low during the month. Long positioning on the energy subsector also added to gains. The subsector benefited from a combination of broad demand for global risk assets and increasing concerns over an undersupplied market. Some partially offsetting losses came from the industrial metals subsector. Long positioning in zinc and copper led losses as the complex suffered its biggest monthly decline on a year-to-date basis. Base metals faced headwinds from a stronger US dollar and climbing inventory stockpiles. Interest rate positions from both long-dated and short-dated instruments provided some partially offsetting losses during the month. Long positioning on the United Kingdom gilt (10-year note) and short sterling (90-day bill) contributed the largest losses to the sector. A 6-month Brexit extension sent UK fixed income prices lower as traders liquidated safe-haven positions as the threat of a hard\u201d UK separation from the European Union (EU) diminished. In the foreign exchange sector, losses were generated in the emerging market (EM) currencies. The trading strategy failed to successfully navigate some choppy price action in the South African rand (against the US dollar) which contributed more than half of the monthly losses within the EM FX sector.\nThe Trust showed a loss in May, with losses coming from stock index and commodity positions, while interest rate and foreign exchange holdings produced some partially offsetting gains during the month. Stock index positions produced the largest Trust losses. Global stock indexes generally saw steep sell-offs during the month and long positioning on global indexes generated losses within the sector, particularly across Europe and in the United States. Those losses were driven by a sharp escalation of trade tension between the US and both China and Mexico, signs that global growth is decelerating, and as the inverted US Treasury yield curve signaled a higher-than-normal recession risk. Commodity trading also generated losses for the Trust in May. Short positioning across the grain subsector produced the worst sector losses as heavy rains across the Midwest prevented a considerable amount of crop planting in the US. Weekly USDA crop progress reports painted a bullish outlook for prices, especially for corn, which rose sharply to a near three-year high. Long holdings on the energy subsector also added to losses. The energy complex suffered amid weakening demand and as US inventory levels rose to a 22-month high. Interest rate positions from both long-dated and short-dated instruments provided some partially offsetting gains during the month. Long positioning on 10-year notes from Australia and the United Kingdom were two of the best performing holdings. Australia's central bank indicated that interest rate cuts were likely in the coming months sending their notes sharply higher (interest rates fell). In the UK, the Brexit impasse became more uncertain as Prime Minister May stepped down and the future leadership of Britain became less clear. Flight to safety flows benefitted the UK gilt. In the foreign exchange sector, gains were generated in the developed market and emerging market currencies. A short position on the Australian dollar drove gains in the developed FX subsector as that currency sold-off amid some weaker than expected economic data releases and dovish comments from the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. A short position on the Chilean peso proved profitable in the EM subsector as that currency weakened on trade angst and weaker copper prices.\nThe Trust showed a profit in June with gains coming from stock index and interest rate positions, while foreign exchange and commodity holdings produced some partially offsetting losses during the month. Stock index positions produced the largest Trust profits. Global stock indices bounced back sharply from May's steep sell-off. Long positioning across most global indexes benefited from signs that major central banks stand ready to provide new stimulus to slowing global economies. Fed Chairman Powell at the June FOMC meeting strongly hinted that rate cuts are coming and ECB President Draghi stated that in the absence of improvement\u201d in inflation data, additional stimulus will be required.\u201d Interest rate positions from both long-dated and short-dated instruments provided additional gains during the month. Long positioning in Australia, the United States, Japan, and Europe all benefited from the possibility of renewed central bank easing. Early in the month, the Reserve Bank of Australia became one of the first G10 central banks to actually cut interest rates amid sluggish economic growth and a decline in real estate prices in the country, and then strongly hinted that additional cuts might be warranted. In the foreign exchange sector, losses were generated in the developed market currencies. A short position on the Norwegian krone (versus the US dollar) led sector losses. The Norges Bank bucked the dovish central bank trend and actually hiked interest rates during the month. The hike marked the third increase over the past nine months amid a surge in oil investments, low unemployment, and inflation running above the central bank's target. Commodity trading provided some small losses for the Trust in June. Industrial metals were the worst performing sub-sector. A short holding on nickel suffered on the back of US dollar weakness and mounting optimism over a Trump-Xi trade meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit near month-end. Some partially offsetting gains were seen in long energy holdings. A long position on gasoline profited after a massive fire shut-down one of the East Coast's largest refineries, crimping supply and sending gas prices sharply higher.\nThe Trust showed a profit in July with interest rate positions from long-dated instruments providing the best gains during the month. Long positioning, especially in Europe and Australia, benefited from mounting global growth concerns, escalating fears over a hard\u201d UK Brexit from the EU, and ongoing uncertainty over the US/Chinese trade war. This confluence of headwinds worked to keep major global central banks in accommodation mode which has been supportive of most global bond markets (higher prices and lower interest rates). Most notably, the US FOMC cut interest rates on the last day of the month and the European Central Bank has given clear indications that it expects to provide new stimulus in September. In the foreign exchange sector, gains were generated in the developed market currencies. Short positions on the euro, Swedish krona, British pound, and Norwegian krone (all long against the US dollar) provided some of the best profits. US economic data has proven to be more resilient than many other regions of the globe to the benefit of the dollar. Concerns over a hard\u201d Brexit in the UK increased after hardliner Boris Johnson was elected as Prime Minister. The pound was the worst performing G10 currency (against the US dollar) during the month. Stock index positions produced additional Trust profits. Long positions in the United Kingdom and Australia were two of the most profitable positions in the sector during July. Stocks in both export-heavy countries rallied strongly as falling currency values in their respective countries fueled gains in companies linked to export activity. Commodity trading also provided some gains for the Trust in July. Short positioning on the grains and softs sub-sectors benefitted from the stronger US dollar and some improving growing conditions. Long positioning on gold and silver profited from flight-to-safety flows amid heightened global uncertainty. Some partially offsetting losses were experience in the industrial metals sub-sector as choppy price action during the month proved challenging.\nThe Trust showed a profit in August, with interest rate positions from long-dated and short-dated instruments provided the best gains during August. Long positioning, especially in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the US benefited from an escalation of trade tensions between the US and China which heightened global growth concerns. Global bond yields sank sharply as safe-haven demand drove bond prices higher. In addition to the above-mentioned growth concerns, markets had plenty to fret about including a growing likelihood of a no-date (aka hard\u201d) UK Brexit from the EU, civil unrest in Hong Kong, and an inverted US yield curve which could be signaling a looming US recession. Commodity trading also provided some gains for the Trust during the month. Short holdings on grains and softs were two of the best performing sub-sectors. Corn futures sank in value after US government reports sparked concerns about oversupply. Cotton prices fell amid the widening trade war which dampened demand expectations. Some partially offsetting losses were experienced in the energy sub-sector as choppy price action proved challenging for our trading systems to profitably navigate. Stock index positions contributed losses to the portfolio during August. Long positions in the UK and Australia were two of the biggest losing positions within the sector. Global stocks mostly dropped during the month amid the expanding trade war and generally weaker than expected economic data outside the US. A short position on the Hong Kong Hang Seng index provided some partially offsetting gains as civil unrest and threats of Chinese intervention unnerved investors which helped our bearish position. In the foreign exchange sector, losses from the emerging markets (EM) overwhelmed gains from the developed markets. Long positioning on EM currencies, such as the Brazilian real and South African rand, suffered after a landslide result from the Argentinian primary election. A possible return to left-wing populism sparked a sharp sell-off in the Argentine peso and the fear quickly spilled over into other EM currencies.\nThe Trust showed a loss in September, with losses coming from interest rate and commodity positions, while stock index holdings produced some partially offsetting gains for the portfolio. Foreign exchange holdings had little impact on the portfolio during the month. Interest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments provided losses during September. Long positioning, especially in Australia and Europe, contributed the largest losses to the sector as progress on the US-Chinese trade talks overshadowed the US political situation. European fixed income markets took an additional leg lower after the ECB's hawkish rate cut and commentary which emphasized fiscal policy over additional monetary stimulus. Partially offsetting those losses were gains from short positions on the US 10 year and 30 year Treasury bonds. Commodity trading produced additional losses for the portfolio during the month. Short positioning in some energy markets suffered after the petroleum complex initially spiked higher following the September 14th rebel attacks on a Saudi Arabian oil field and processing facility. In the softs, a short sugar holding incurred losses as the commodity was boosted by signs of tightening supplies. Additional losses were produced from our short grain holdings. The grain markets rose as potential purchases of US agricultural goods by China were said to be in focus in discussions between the countries' trade representatives. Foreign exchange positions had little net P&L impact to the portfolio during September. Gains in our emerging market positions were overwhelmed by a short position on the Australian dollar. The Aussie currency moved higher on back of the improvements in US-Chinese trade talks and the Australian central bank pausing their monetary policy easing measures. Long global stock positioning provided the portfolio with some partially offsetting gains. Stock indexes closed higher in September but ebbed and flowed throughout the month as the markets focused on better US-Chinese trade headlines, improving US macro data, geopolitical concerns, and expectations for more central bank policy support. The best monthly stock index gains were found in Europe.\nLosses in October were from foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity, and stock index positions as the Trust's FX holdings contributed the largest declines during the month. Losses were dominated by short positions in the developed market currencies (versus long the USD), specifically in the British pound, and Australian and New Zealand dollars. The US dollar was broadly weaker during the month amid a US interest rate cut and as risk-on flows were fueled by improving sentiment around both US-China trade relations and the Brexit outlook. The British pound rallied throughout the month on back of Brexit-related enthusiasm. The Australian and New Zealand dollars benefited from the generally positive progress on US-China trade negotiations. Interest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments contributed additional losses. Long positioning in Japan, Australia, and Europe all suffered amid improving risk sentiment driven by signs that the US and China were making concrete advancements with Phase One\u201d of the trade deal. Progress towards an orderly United Kingdom exit from the European Union also helped drive investors out of fixed income and into riskier assets which hurt the Trust's rate positioning. Commodity trading also produced losses for the Trust during October. The energy sub-sector was the main detractor as a short position on natural gas suffered amid cooler than expected temperatures in the US, which sent prices sharply higher. In addition, choppy price action within the petroleum complex proved challenging for our trading systems to profitably navigate. Some partially offsetting gains were achieved in the precious metals, meats, and grains sub-sectors. Global stock index trading was also a drag on the Trust during the month. Short-term strategies experienced losses in the United Kingdom's FTSE 100 index as they were whipsawed by a sharp sell-off early in October, followed by a recovery later in the month. Some partially offsetting gains were seen from long positioning on US and Japanese stock indices which rose driven by the risk-on tailwinds and better than expected earnings reports seen during the month. Losses in the UK overwhelmed any gains experienced in other regions of the world.\nThe Trust had a gain in November led by stock index, foreign exchange, and interest rate positions while commodity holdings created some partially offsetting losses for the portfolio. Global stock index trading produced some of the best gains for the Trust during the month. Long positioning across most global stock indexes proved profitable as equities generally moved higher. Investors were driven to deploy sidelined cash amid positive US-China phase one\u201d trade deal expectations, traction from the global monetary policy pivot, Fed and ECB balance sheet expansion, and some signs of global growth stabilization. In the foreign exchange sector, gains were generated in the developed market and emerging market currencies. A short position on the Australian dollar drove gains in the developed FX subsector as that currency sold-off amid weaker than expected employment data and expectations for easier monetary policy in the foreseeable future. A short position on the Chilean peso proved profitable in the emerging market subsector. What started as a national strike\u201d in Chile's capital city quickly developed into rioting and significant social unrest across the country, causing a sharp sell-off in their local currency. Interest rate positions contributed to profits with gains in long-dated bonds overwhelming losses in short-dated notes. The UK parliament voted in favor of a December general election which calmed Brexit jitters and prompted UK 10-year bonds to sell off, creating profits for our short positioning. Partially offsetting losses came from long US 2-year Treasury note holdings which slumped on the back of improving trade talks. Commodity holdings contributed the largest declines to the Trust during the month. Losses were dominated by the energy and industrial metal sub-sectors. Choppy price action within the petroleum complex proved challenging for our trading systems to profitably navigate. The industrial metal sub-sector detracted as long nickel and zinc positions suffered losses. Nickel trended lower throughout the month as concerns over tight supply eased, while zinc fell on increasingly bearish fundamentals.\nThe Trust generated losses in December with its interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity positions, while stock index holdings created some partially offsetting gains for the Trust. The interest rate sector generated some of the largest monthly losses. Long positioning on both long-dated and short-dated instruments suffered as prices fell (yields rose) as safe-haven assets were sold due to a resurgent risk-on environment driven by positive progress on a US-China trade agreement. A long position on the Australian 10-year note generated the largest losses within the sector as that instrument sold-off throughout the month. Foreign exchange trading was also a major detractor to the Trust during December. Short positions on the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar (both versus long US dollar) suffered amid an improvement in risk-on sentiment. A cooling of trade tensions between the US and China helped to fuel monthly gains for both of these so-called \"commodity currencies\" which hurt the Trust's short positioning. Some partially offsetting gains were found in the emerging FX sub-sector. A long position on the Brazilian real (versus short US dollar) benefitted from the same risk-on dynamic. Commodity holdings contributed small additional losses during the month. Short positioning on the grain markets, most notably a short on soybeans, were hurt by progress on a new US-Chinese trade accord where China agreed to purchase large quantities of US crops which sent prices higher. Mostly offsetting gains were generated by the energy sub-sector. Long positioning on Brent and crude produced some of the best profits as those products benefitted from lower inventory levels, some rising geopolitical risks, and a weaker US dollar. Global stock index trading produced the only gains for the Trust during December. Long positioning across most global stock indexes proved profitable as equities generally moved higher during the month. Diminished trade tensions, supportive central bank policies, and dampened risk related to Brexit all provided a tailwind for stocks to close out the decade.\n2018 (For the Year Ended December 31)\nOf the (9.03)% return for the year ended December 31, 2018 for Series A, approximately (5.87)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (5.14)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, offering costs and operating costs, offset by approximately 1.98% due to investment income earned by Series A.\nOf the (8.66)% return for year ended December 31, 2018 for Series B, approximately (5.87)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (4.77)% due to brokerage fees, management fees and operating costs, offset by approximately 1.98% due to investment income earned by Series B.\nOf the (8.15)% return for the year ended December 31, 2018 for Series D, approximately (5.87)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (4.26)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, offering costs and operating costs, offset by approximately 1.98% due to investment income earned by Series D.\nOf the (7.28)% return for the year ended December 31, 2018 for Series W, approximately (5.87)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (3.39)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, offering costs and operating costs, offset by approximately 1.98% due to investment income earned by Series W.\nAn analysis of the (5.87)% gross trading losses for the Trust for the year by sector is as follows:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> Sector\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.00\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.47\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.79\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Indices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.87\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust showed a profit in January as gains came from foreign exchange, stock index, and interest rate holdings. Commodity positions showed some losses. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging FX markets, generated gains during January. The Trust was predominately positioned short the US dollar against other traded currencies and benefitted from a weaker greenback during the month. The weakness can be attributed to a few different themes, including expected hawkish central bank policy shifts outside the US as growth exceeds expectations, trade tensions, and US deficit concerns. The best gains came from long positioning on the British pound, Norwegian krone, and euro all versus short the US dollar. Long positioning on global stock indices also drove profits for the Trust. Most global stock indices welcomed 2018 with robust gains driven by a variety of factors. A synchronized upswing of global economic growth, stronger than expected corporate earnings results, and a major tailwind from the recently passed tax reform in the US all drove equities higher. The so-called fear of missing out\u201d dynamic only intensified the demand for equity exposure. The best profits were generated in the United States and across Asia, specifically in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Interest rate positions, from long-dated and short-dated bond markets, created additional gains for the Trust. Short positioning on US markets, specifically the 10-year and 5-year notes along with 90-day Eurodollar and 2-year notes, drove a bulk of the profits in the sector. US yields marched higher throughout the month as bond prices dropped amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve will continue its gradual interest rate policy tightening, as US inflation expectations continue to firm against a positive economic backdrop. Commodity holdings produced losses during the month. Profits from long positioning on precious and industrial metals and energy markets were overwhelmed by losses from short grain holdings. The weaker US dollar and stronger economic environment helped the metal and energy longs while strong export sales data hurt the grain shorts.\nThe Trust declined in February due to losses from stock index, commodity, and foreign exchange holdings. Fixed income positions showed partially offsetting gains. Long positioning on global stock indices drove losses for the Trust. After extending the long-term rally to start 2018, global equity markets spiked lower in the first half of the month. The sell-off was led by US stocks as markets experienced a sharp increase in volatility. While crowded equity positions sold off on profit-taking, the VIX (a measure of volatility on the S&P 500) had its largest ever daily climb on February 5th. The largest Trust loss came out of the US, specifically on the short VIX contract. Commodity holdings produced additional losses. The biggest commodity sub-sector losses were found within the energy markets as long positioning across the complex suffered on the back of increasing US supplies. Additionally, short grain positions generated losses as those markets rallied on strong export sales activity and weather concerns in key growing regions. Long precious metal positions also produced losses amid the stronger US dollar, firmer inflation, and quicker Fed tightening expectations. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging FX markets, generated losses during February. After the recent trend of a weakening US dollar, the Trust was positioned short the USD against all of our traded currencies and suffered from a broad correction in the greenback during the month. The reaction from the FX markets to the equity sell-off early in the month was relatively muted, and the market instead focused on higher US yields and heightened inflation expectations. Interest rate positions created some offsetting gains for the Trust. Short positioning on US markets drove the bulk of the profits in the sector. After global fixed income markets rallied on the risk-off trade early in February, Treasuries saw a greater correction than other government bond markets. US yields ultimately moved higher on the month amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its path of tightening, while inflation expectations continue to firm against a positive economic backdrop.\nMarch for the Trust was comprised of gains from commodity holdings while stock index and foreign exchange positions showed partially offsetting losses. Interest rate positions had little impact on the Trust during the month. Commodity holdings produced the best gains during March. Long positioning on the crude complex within the energy sub-sector generated profits. Geopolitical concerns around the US potentially pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, bullish inventory data, and speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) might extend existing production cuts all combined to push energy prices higher during the month. Mixed positioning across the softs sub-sector proved profitable in March as well. A short sugar position gained amid ongoing global surplus concerns while a long cocoa holding also experienced profits as output worries from the Ivory Coast lifted prices. Long positioning on global stock indices produced some losses for the Trust. Holdings in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and the US contributed to some of the worst performance within the sector. Fear over a potential global trade war, tightening financial conditions after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and concern over additional turnover among senior members of President Trump's inner circle all put pressure on global equity markets during the month. Foreign exchange positioning on developed FX markets drove the sector's losses during March. A late month rally in the US dollar produced losses from short dollar positions. The largest loss came from short US dollar versus a long euro holding. Dampening of concerns around a global trade war and quarter-end flows into the greenback both helped to boost the currency in the waning days of the month. Positioning on emerging market currencies produced almost no P&L effect for the Trust during March. Interest rate positions contributed a negligible P&L impact for the Trust. Gains from long-term markets were offset by losses in short-term markets leaving the sector nearly unchanged for the month.\nThe Trust had losses in April which came from foreign exchange and commodity positions while fixed income and stock index holdings produced some partially offsetting gains for the Trust. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging FX markets, generated losses in April. After the recent trend of a weakening US dollar, the Trust was positioned short the US dollar against most of our traded currencies and suffered from a broad correction in the greenback. Early in the month, FX markets focused more on trade frictions and geopolitical tension but as those concerns eased, the market instead looked to higher US interest rates and heightened inflation expectations, causing a US dollar rally. Commodity holdings produced additional losses during April. The biggest sub-sector detractor was found within the industrial metals complex. Short positioning on aluminum suffered when the commodity pushed higher on supply worries following Russian sanctions by the White House. Energy and soft commodity holdings produced partially offsetting gains. Long positioning across the crude complex generated profits as the sub-sector rose to multi-year highs on supply disruptions. Interest rate positions, from long-dated and short-dated bond markets, created gains for the Trust. Short positioning on US markets, specifically the 10-year and 5-year notes along with Eurodollar and 2-year notes, drove profits in the sector. US bond prices fell and yields trended higher with the 10-year note yield piercing the widely scrutinized 3% level intra-month. Firming inflation expectations and the rebound in the US dollar provided support to yields. Long positioning on several stock indices produced additional gains as global stock markets rose in April. Reduced tariff tensions, strong US earnings, and eased geopolitical concerns on the Korean peninsula provided a tailwind for equities during the month. Additionally, European stocks were supported after the European Central Bank ( ECB\u201d) steered away from any surprises during their April meeting.\nLosses in May came from all four asset classes traded by the Trust - Interest Rates, FX, Commodities, and Stock Indices. Interest rate positions generated some of the largest losses for the Trust during May. Long positioning on the Italian 10-year note suffered amid a sharp sell-off due to political turmoil in the country which sparked speculation that Italy might leave the European Union. That same turmoil sent US interest rate markets higher due to safe-haven buying which hurt the Trust as it was positioned short across the entire US interest rate curve in anticipation of further FOMC rate hikes later this year. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging FX markets, also generated losses during the month. A long position on the British pound (versus short US dollar) declined in value as the ongoing BREXIT impasse, weaker UK economic data, and fading Bank of England rate-hike expectations all conspired to push the currency lower. A long position on the Turkish lira added to sector losses as economic and political woes in that country sent the EM currency to record lows against the dollar. Commodity holdings produced additional losses as well. A short sugar position suffered as the soft commodity advanced as Brazilian supply concerns boosted prices amid a trucker strike in the country. Other sub-sector losses were experienced in the grains, meats, and precious metals. The energy sub-sector, however, provided some partially offsetting gains. Long positioning across the crude complex benefitted as prices generally stayed in the uptrend that began almost one year ago. Long positioning on a variety of global stock indices produced some good profits for the Trust early in the month as most world indices experienced gains. Unfortunately, later in May, the political concerns that flared in Italy and renewed trade tensions between the US and China trigged a sharp reversal in prices, especially in Europe and Asia, which resulted in losses for some of the holdings. A long position on the Italian stock index was one of the worst performing markets for the sector.\nGains in June came from all four asset classes traded by the Trust - FX, Interest Rates, Commodities, and Stock Indices. Foreign exchange positioning generated some of the strongest gains during the month. While the positive returns were dominated by our short developed market positions (versus long the USD), we also saw gains across various emerging market currencies as well. The US dollar saw choppy trading early in June but ultimately continued the uptrend from the first two months of the second quarter. The DXY dollar index hit fresh 2018 highs and the greenback finished the month stronger versus the majority of our tradeable currencies. The back and forth headlines on a potential global trade war, coupled with dovish policies outside of the US, proved to be the major macro themes driving foreign exchange markets during the month. Interest rate positions generated additional gains for the Trust during June. Short positioning in US markets, specifically the 90-day Eurodollar and 2-year notes, created the bulk of fixed income gains as yields rose (prices fell) on the back of a 25 basis point FOMC rate hike, hawkish US Fed commentary, and a higher-than-expected projection for two additional US rate hikes this year. Policy divergence between the Fed and other central banks, such as the ECB and the Bank of Japan, benefitted our positioning. Commodity holdings produced small additional profits as well. A short corn position experienced strong profits as the grain fell to multi-month lows amid above-average crop progress and on concerns that trade tensions between the US and China could hurt US exports. Long energy positions produced profits after a larger-than-expected reduction in US oil inventories. Long positioning on a variety of global stock indices added slightly to the positive monthly result. Stock index returns ebbed and flowed on the numerous headlines surrounding trade tensions between the US and her trading partners. Some of the best monthly stock index gains were found in Australia, Canada, and the United States.\nLosses in July came from commodities, FX and interest rates, while stock indices provided some partially offsetting gains. Commodity holdings produced some of the largest monthly losses for the Trust. Long energy positions declined as the complex fell from multi-year highs amid a myriad of bearish developments including global trade tensions and climbing output from OPEC. Short grain positions suffered as the agricultural complex rallied sharply sparking a short squeeze amid supply concerns. Long positioning on the industrial metals also created losses due to a sell-off created by fears over a global trade war and related concerns about future demand from China. Foreign exchange positioning generated additional losses during the month. Short commodity currency holdings (versus long US dollar) produced losses for the Trust as those markets rose as trade war fears dampened somewhat in the second half of the month. Short European foreign exchange positioning (versus long US dollar) also experienced losses, most notably from the Swedish krona which rallied after the Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) turned more hawkish amid stronger economic data in that country during the month. Interest rate positions were also a drag on the Trust during July. Long positioning in Europe and the APAC region suffered as bond investors grew more concerned that global central banks are beginning to slowly withdraw stimulus with an eye towards higher interest rates in the future. Short positioning across much of the US interest rate curve provided some partially offsetting gains as US fixed income prices fell with other global bond markets. Long positioning on a variety of global stock indices added some partially offsetting gains to the Trust during the month. Most stock indices enjoyed a bullish tailwind from a stronger-than-expected second quarter earnings season which eclipsed the uncertainty caused by on-again, off-again international trade tensions.\nProfits in August came from commodities and FX while interest rates and stock indices provided some partially offsetting losses during the month. Commodity holdings produced some of the largest monthly gains for the Trust. Short grain positions profited as the sub-sector sold off amid trade turmoil, beneficial weather, and higher yield estimates. Long energy holdings across the crude complex experienced gains as looming US sanctions on Iran, which are expected to cripple the nation's oil exports, as well as larger than expected US inventory draws, fueled prices higher. The soft commodity sub-sector also added gains to the bottom-line, led by a short coffee holding. Coffee prices were pressured to a 12-year low amid a weaker Brazilian real and record harvest forecasts in Brazil. Foreign exchange positioning generated additional profits during the month. Long US dollar positions, against both developed and emerging market currencies, generated the gains. A short New Zealand dollar holding (versus long US dollar) experienced some of the greatest gains as weaker economic data and a dovish central bank caused the kiwi to sell-off. In emerging markets, a short holding on the South African rand (versus long US dollar) provided profits as expectations for further increases in US interest rates continued to put pressure on emerging market currencies. Interest rate positions were a drag on the Trust during August. Short positioning on US and United Kingdom fixed income markets suffered amid flight-to-safety buying and short-covering. Mounting concerns over the stability of emerging markets, especially in countries such as Argentina and Turkey, fueled demand for the relative safety of fixed income instruments as potential contagion fears spread. Long positioning on a variety of global stock indices also detracted from the monthly gains of the Trust. European and Asia long holdings generated most of the losses. Ongoing global trade tensions linked with uncertainty over BREXIT negotiations in the UK, and weaker than expected tech earnings, in Asia pressured those regions lower.\nThe Trust declined in September due to losses from FX and stock index positions, while commodity and fixed income holdings produced offsetting gains for the Trust. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging markets, generated losses in September. After the recent trend of a strengthening US dollar and emerging market weakness, the Trust was positioned long the US dollar against most of our traded currencies and suffered from a correction in the greenback. Early in the month, FX markets focused more on trade frictions and geopolitical tension but those concerns gradually eased and emerging market currencies saw their first monthly gain since March. Stock index holdings produced additional losses for the Trust. Long positioning on a variety of indices suffered from choppy markets that were whipsawed by global trade concerns between the US and her major economic partners. Balancing losses were gains seen from the Nikkei, which posted its best month in a year. Japanese shares were helped by a weaker yen which acted as a tailwind to exporters and a government which may be willing to make a trade deal. Interest rate positions from short US fixed income markets created gains for the Trust during the month. US bond markets fell and yields rose due to firming inflation data, a hike by the US Federal Reserve, and the decreasing risk of emerging market contagion. Providing smaller offsetting losses were our long positions on the long-dated European bond markets. Commodity holdings produced additional offsetting gains for the Trust during the month. The largest sub-sector gains were found in energies as long WTI and Brent oil positions profited. Oil prices rose on the potential for refinery disruptions from tropical storms and fears of a supply crunch from looming US-lead sanctions on Iran, outweighing the bearish effects of escalating disputes over global trade.\nStock index holdings generated steep losses for the Trust during October as long positioning on a variety of global indices suffered as most world stocks sold-off sharply. A myriad of negative headwinds for global equities contributed to the sudden risk-off tone including peak earnings concerns, tighter financial conditions, trade-war fears, decelerating Chinese economic growth, the strong US dollar, waning benefits from US tax reform, geopolitical tensions on several fronts, a slowdown in corporate buyback activity ahead of Q3 earnings reports, and a weakening US housing market. Commodity holdings caused additional losses for the Trust during October. The energy and softs sub-sectors produced the worst results. Long positioning on the petroleum complex sold-off in sympathy with global stocks. In the softs, a short position on coffee produced losses as that commodity rose about 10% during the month, fueled by Brazilian real strength that triggered a bout of short covering. The grains sub-sector provided some offsetting gains as short holdings profited as the complex traded lower during the month amid the stronger US dollar. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging markets, generated some partially offsetting gains in October. Long positioning on the US dollar, the highest yielding G10 currency, profited as key European currencies stumbled following renewed BREXIT-related concerns and some disappointing economic data in the region. In the G10 basket of currencies, only the Japanese yen outperformed the US dollar as safe-haven buying benefitted the yen over the dollar. Interest rate positions from long German and Japanese markets created additional partially offsetting gains. Safe-haven demand pushed fixed income prices up (yields fell) which boosted the Trust's long holdings, leading to a positive sector outcome during October.\nIn November, losses came from foreign exchange, fixed income, and stock index positions, while commodity holdings produced some partially offsetting gains for the Trust. Foreign exchange positioning, in both developed and emerging markets, generated the largest losses in November. Long positioning on the US dollar against most of our traded currencies proved to be a headwind for the Trust. After having one of its best months in two years in October, the US dollar saw choppy trading throughout the month of November. A potential shift in US FOMC interest rate policy, trade war headlines, and a softening US inflation outlook helped prevent the dollar from a continuation of its broader move higher. Interest rate positions from short US 2-year notes and short US 90-day Eurodollars led to sector losses. Short-dated fixed income markets rallied in the US (yields fell) as several dovish speeches by US FOMC members, including Chairman Powell, indicated that the Fed might be closer to pausing US interest rate hikes than the market previously expected. Stock index positions also detracted during the month. The Trust held a mix of long and short positioning across the traded universe of global indices. Most global indices experienced a choppy month as traders weighed a mix of news related to trade wars, US Fed policy, global economic growth, and BREXIT. Some small gains were found in North America, but more than offsetting losses were realized in Europe and Asia. Commodity holdings produced some partially offsetting gains for the Trust during November, with the energy sub-sector realizing the best results. Long positioning on natural gas proved profitable as colder than expected temperatures in the US set-off a rally that led to a massive short-squeeze, sending prices higher by almost 40% during the month. A short on gasoline was also profitable as the petroleum complex continued its recent sell-off. Some partially offsetting losses were seen in a short soybean position as hopes for a truce in the US-Chinese trade war sent prices higher.\nProfits in December were seen across all major asset classes traded - foreign exchange, commodities, interest rates, and stock indices. Foreign exchange positioning, mostly from developed markets, generated some robust gains in December. Short positioning on several of the so-called commodity currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar (all versus long the US dollar), produced the best gains. The Canadian dollar sold off in sympathy with the meltdown in prices across the petroleum complex during the month. The Aussie dollar fell in value as China, a major export market for Australian commodities, reported weaker than expected economic data, generating concern about future demand. Commodity holdings also produced solid gains for the Trust during December, with the softs, grains, and industrial metals sub-sectors realizing the best results. Short positioning on cotton profited as prices fell due to concerns surrounding a recent slowdown in export sales activity. A short holding on soybeans proved profitable as prices fell amid a slowdown in US exports due to the ongoing US trade dispute with China. Short positioning on aluminum also produced profits from falling prices fueled by a barrage of weaker than expected economic data out of China. Interest rate positions from short-dated instruments provided additional profits during the month. Long positioning on short-term notes issued by the US, Europe, Canada, and the United Kingdom all generated gains. These positions benefitted from flight-to-safety flows seen during December as investors aggressively sold stocks and sought the relative safety that fixed income instruments provide. Stock index positions also added to gains during December. Short positioning on several global indices generated profits as most global stocks experienced a steep sell-off. A myriad of headwinds sent stocks reeling including higher US interest rates, signs of a global economic slowdown, ongoing tensions between the US and China over trade policies, and a partial US government shutdown fueled by bipartisan tensions.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report discusses the operations and financial condition of the Campbell Fund Trust, which trades in U.S. and international futures, forward, and centrally cleared swap markets.

The Trust is a successor to the Campbell Fund Limited Partnership (formerly known as the Commodity Trend Fund) which began trading operations in January 1972. The Trust currently trades in the U.S. and international futures, forward and centrally cleared swap markets under the sole direction of Campbell & Company, LP, the managing operator of the Trust. Specifically, the Trust trades in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies, credit and commodities. The Trust is an actively managed account with speculative trading profits as its objective.\nEffective August 31, 2008, the Trust began offering Series A, Series B, and Series W Units. The units in the Trust prior to that date became Series B Units. Series B Units are only available for additional investment by existing holders of Series B Units. Effective August 1, 2017, the Trust began offering Series D units.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate capitalization of the Trust was $279,565,692 with Series A, Series B, Series D and Series W comprising $216,523,843, $32,296,756, $5,043,054 and $25,702,039, respectively, of the total. The Net Asset Value per Unit was $2,579.95 for Series A, $2,837.78 for Series B, $1,059.92 for Series D and $3,112.12 for Series W.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the Financial Statements.\nThe Trust records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements of Operations. Generally, fair values are based on market prices; however, in certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price (i.e., forward contracts which are traded in the inter-bank market).\nCapital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Trust generally maintains 60% to 75% of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. After redemptions and additions are taken into account each month, the trade levels of the Trust are adjusted and positions in the instruments the Trust trades are added or liquidated on a pro-rata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels.\nLiquidity\nMost United States futures exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as \"daily price fluctuation limits\" or \"daily limits.\" During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Trust from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Trust to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Trust may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Trust's futures trading operations, the Trust's assets are expected to be highly liquid.\nThe entire offering proceeds, without deductions, will be credited to the Trust's bank, custodial and/or cash management accounts. The Trust meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash and U.S. government securities with the futures broker and the over-the-counter counterparty. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures, forward and swap contracts. The Trust receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Trust assets.\nApproximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury Bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 5% to 15% of the Trust's assets are deposited with the over-the-counter counterparty or centrally cleared in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparty.\nThe managing operator deposits the majority of those assets of the Trust that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in a custodial account with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial account with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial account constitutes approximately 60% to 75% of the Trust's assets and are invested directly by PNC Capital Advisors, LLC (\"PNC\"). PNC is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. PNC does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Trust's assets in the custodial account. PNC invest the assets according to agreed upon investment guidelines that first preserve capital, second allow for sufficient liquidity, and third provide a yield beyond the risk-free rate. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt; and (iv) Asset Backed Securities.\nThe Trust occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparty, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody account at Northern Trust Company to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Trust has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.\nThe Trust's assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell & Company or any affiliated entities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term \"off-balance sheet risk\" refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Trust trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Trust, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Trust at the same time, and if the Trust's trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Trust, the Trust could lose all of its assets and the Unitholders would realize a 100% loss. Campbell & Company, the managing operator (who also acts as trading advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30% however, these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk of loss.\nIn addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and swap contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Trust. The counterparty for futures contracts and centrally cleared swap contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.\nIn the case of forward contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Campbell & Company trades for the Trust only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Trust are valued each day at fair value. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Trust.\nDisclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value\nThe Trust invests in futures, forward currency, and centrally cleared swap contracts. The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of centrally cleared swap contracts is determined by using currency market quotations provided by an independent external pricing source.\nResults of Operations\nThe returns for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 for Series A were 0.46%, 7.75% and (9.03)%, Series B were 0.97%, 8.29% and (8.66)%, Series D were 1.73%, 7.79% and (8.15)% and Series W were 2.50%, 9.93% and (7.28)% respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued management fees in the amounts of $8,472,866, $12,792,990, and $16,863,539, respectively, and paid management fees in the amounts of $8,990,885, $12,901,756, and $17,499,643, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued sales commissions in the amounts of $2,990,891, $0, and $0, respectively, and paid sales commissions in the amounts of $2,573,244, $0, and $0, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $0, respectively, and paid performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $3,207.\n2020 (For the Year Ended December 31)\nOf the 0.46% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series A, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.67)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series A.\nOf the 0.97% return for year ended December 31, 2020 for Series B, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.16)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions and operating costs borne by Series B.\nOf the 1.73% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series D, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (4.40)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series D.\nOf the 2.50% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series W, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (3.63)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series W.\nAn analysis of the 5.03% gross trading losses for the Trust for the year by sector is as follows:\n\nThe Trust had a strong start to 2020 with gains coming from interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange positions, while stock index holdings provided some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia, Europe, and the United States benefited as prices advanced on a flight to safety bid sparked by the worsening Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. A short position on the Canadian 10-year note created some partially offsetting losses, which were accelerated by downward pressure on yields prompted by a dovish shift by Bank of Canada policymakers. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust in January, with the energy sub-sector realizing the best results. Short positioning on natural gas proved profitable as milder weather across the US weighed on demand prospects. Additional gains were generated from short industrial metal holdings. The base metal complex traded weaker as the coronavirus epidemic raised investor concerns about its negative impact on the Chinese economy. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong dollar as well as technical selling. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed market currencies. Short positions on the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits. The commodity-linked currencies came under pressure as commodity prices sold-off on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials. A long Brazilian real holding produced some partially offsetting losses after risk fell out of favor and investors sold emerging market currencies. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during January. Long positioning across most global stock indexes profited early in the month amid the ratification of the phase one\u201d US-China trade deal, renewed central bank balance sheet expansion, Brexit clarity, and some better than expected US earnings releases. However, profits were relinquished in the second-half of the month as stocks traded lower following risk-off trading as the coronavirus outbreak intensified.\nGains from interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity positions led to a profitable February for the Trust, while stock index holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia and the United States continued to benefit as prices advanced on flight to safety buying sparked by the worsening COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic. Investors aggressively sought the safety of fixed income instruments, sending global yields tumbling and expectations for further central bank stimulus soaring. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed and emerging market currencies. Short positions on the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits for the sector. These commodity-linked currencies came under renewed selling pressure during February. The widening spread of COVID-19 to countries outside of China, such as Japan, South Korea, and Italy, sparked new concerns that global economic growth would slow materially, thus blunting the demand for raw materials. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 outbreak is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during February with the greatest declines seen in Australia, Japan, and the United States. Long positioning across most global stock indexes generally profited during the first two-thirds of the month. However, late in February global stock indexes experienced steep sell-offs sparked by the coronavirus's quick spread to countries outside of China where it initially began. World economic growth fears and supply chain disruption concerns spread rapidly, sending most global stock indexes sharply lower.\nThe Trust had an unprofitable March, with losses coming from stock index and interest rate holdings, while foreign exchange and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Global stock index trading produced the largest losses for the Trust, with the greatest declines seen in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Long positioning across most global stock indexes suffered severely as equity indexes experienced very sharp sell-offs during the month. The COVID-19 virus spread quickly throughout Europe and North America prompting containment measures in the form of stay at home\u201d directives, closures, and shutdowns that sharply curtailed economic activity. Global central banks and governments took unprecedented steps in an effort to soften the financial impact from the virus, but fear over the length and depth of the growth slowdown sent risky assets sharply lower. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed small additional losses during the month. Short positioning on US 10-year notes and US long bonds suffered amid the flight-to-safety scramble that ensued due to the severe economic upheaval wrought by the COVID-19 virus. Long positioning across global short-dated instruments helped to partially offset losses within the sector. Profits were dominated by short positions on the commodity currencies (versus long the USD), specifically in the Norwegian krone. The US dollar was sharply higher during the month amid the extreme flight-to-quality moves. Adding further downward pressure on oil-linked currencies, the petroleum markets sold off severely when tensions escalated between OPEC and Russia, and Saudi Arabia made the decision to ramp up production. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 pandemic is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling.\nThe Trust's losses in April came from foreign exchange and interest rate holdings, while stock index and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Short positioning on several of the developed market currencies, namely the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied on a partial lifting of COVID-19 containment measures in those countries. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed additional losses to the portfolio. Long positions on Australian 10-year bonds suffered after the RBA tapered bond-buying operations and the country became one of the first to meaningfully ease lockdown restrictions. Short German Bund positions added to losses as Germany's debt rallied versus periphery European bonds with Germany weathering the effects of COVID-19 better than their Eurozone counterparts. Stock indexes rebounded considerably from the oversold conditions seen during March as the United States and other countries laid out plans to reopen their economies from the COVID-19 lockdown that has proven to be very damaging to local, regional, and global economic growth. The Trust held a mixture of long and short positioning across global stock indexes during the month. Ultimately the gains on long positions more than offset losses experienced on any short holdings, leading to positive net P&L within the sector. Commodity holdings produced additional partially offsetting profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the petroleum complex produced a bulk of the sector's profits. Crude oil sold off sharply on the lethal combination of COVID-19 stay at home\u201d induced demand destruction linked with a shortage of available storage capacity. The May WTI futures contract went below zero for the first time in history as long holders scrambled to sell before contract expiration in order to avoid taking physical delivery given the scarcity of demand and lack of available storage space.\nLosses in May once again came from foreign exchange, as well as commodity and stock index holdings, while interest rate positions contributed some gains. May's short positioning on several of the so-called commodity currencies, namely the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied strongly. Fueling the run-up was a sharp rebound in many beaten down commodity markets, specifically the energy complex, as optimism grew that the worst of the COVID-19 crisis was over. A long position on the Canadian dollar (versus short the US dollar) contributed some partially offsetting gains for the sector on the same commodity currency drivers cited above. Commodity holdings produced additional losses for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the energy, grain, and industrial metal complexes showed losses as those markets rallied driven by the improving COVID-19 crisis. A long holding on precious metals, specifically silver, produced some partially offsetting gains for the sector as expected industrial demand overwhelmed limited supplies of the metal. Short positioning on stock indexes in Europe and Japan suffered as most global stock indices continued to bounce higher from the March COVID-19 crisis lows. Regional economic re-openings linked with no new major spikes in coronavirus cases fueled the equity optimism. A long position on the Hong Kong Hang Seng index added to sector losses as that market was one of the few global indexes to sell-off during May. China's legislature approved a proposal to impose a highly contentious national security law in the semi-autonomous territory which sparked the regional equity sell-off. Interest rate positions from both long and short-dated instruments contributed partially offsetting gains to the Trust in May. A short position on the German 10-year note was one of the most profitable markets in the sector. The German Bund sold-off during the month (prices lower and yields higher) as signs of improvement in the coronavirus crisis caused traders to shun safe haven assets in favor of riskier ones.\nForeign exchange trading in both the emerging and developed markets produced losses for the Trust during June. The greatest declines were seen in the Norwegian krone, Australian dollar, and certain Latin American currencies. These commodity-linked currencies strengthened to start the month, causing some strategies to cover their previously held long positions, only to reverse those moves later in June. The investor exuberance over additional government stimulus and the economic re-openings quickly wore off on reports of increasing COVID-19 infection outbreaks. Short soft commodity and industrial metal holdings suffered as the dollar weakened early in the month and as optimism over a rapid recovery in economic growth bolstered prices. Short grain positions produced losses on the last trading day of the month as the grain complex rallied sharply after the USDA reported acreage that trailed estimates. Within the energy sub-sector, a short natural gas holding provided some offsetting gains amid plummeting US gas exports as well as shifting weather and market supply dynamics. Meanwhile, stock index trading generated some offsetting gains. The Trust held a mix of long and short positions across the traded universe of indexes and showed a gain in Asia and North America, but partially offsetting losses were realized in Europe. Most global indexes experienced a choppy month amid mixed coronavirus news coupled with hopes for more stimulus from central banks. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments also contributed small offsetting gains during the month. The Bank of Japan signaled plans to buy more shorter-maturity bonds which caused the yield curve to steepen and benefited our short positioning on longer-dated Japanese government bonds.\nJuly saw losses for the Trust, driven primarily from stock index holdings and foreign exchange trading in the emerging and developed markets. The United States' inability to get the COVID-19 virus under control in the face of other nations of the world seemingly better able to handle the crisis generated concern that US economic growth would lag other countries, leading the FOMC to keep highly accommodative monetary easing in place longer. This dichotomy weakened the US dollar to two-year lows hurting the Trust's long US dollar positioning against many other currencies. Stock index trading also generated losses for the Trust during July. Long positioning, primarily in Asia-Pacific and Europe, produced the bulk of the sector's decline. Late in the month both the Asia-Pacific and European regions began to see an uptick in COVID-19 virus cases. Regional governments were quick to discuss the possibility of once again needing to shutdown economies to halt the spread which led to rapid risk-off sentiment in equity markets leading to lower prices. Commodity trading generated the best partially offsetting profits for the Trust. Long positioning on silver and gold proved profitable as both metals showed strong monthly gains. The aforementioned drivers of US dollar weakness were the primary cause of precious metal subsector gains. Some partially offsetting losses came from the grain and energy subsectors. Short grain holdings generated losses as the grain complex rallied during the month on poor crop conditions in the US Plains. Short positioning on natural gas suffered as high summer electric demand in the US sparked high price volatility that the systematic models failed to trade profitably. Interest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments also contributed gains during July. Long positioning on fixed income instruments profited as prices rose (yields fell) amid US/Chinese geopolitical tensions and as high uncertainty over the course of the COVID-19 crisis led to demand for safe haven assets.\nInterest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments contributed some of the largest losses for the Trust during August. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments suffered as prices fell (yields rose). The COVID-19 crisis and related emergency fiscal spending has created the need for many governments around the world to finance this spending with new and, in some cases, record levels of debt issuance. That issuance put downward pressure on most global sovereign bond instruments which created losses for the Trust. Commodity trading also experienced sizeable losses for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated large losses as that commodity rose over 30% during the month. Hot temperatures across the United States drove demand for natural gas for electricity generation to power air conditioning while inventory data showed storage at lower than expected levels. Some partially offsetting gains were experienced in long industrial metals positioning. Longs on copper and nickel profited as prices rose amid signs of a global supply shortage in the face of rising demand from countries such as China. Stock index trading generated partially offsetting gains for the Trust during August. Long positioning, especially in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany, produced profits as indexes in those countries experienced strong gains. A lessening of COVID-19 infections, signs that some governments were less willing to renew economic shutdowns to manage the virus crisis, and ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus actions were all supportive of global stocks during the month. Lastly, foreign exchange trading contributed small additional gains during the month. Losses in emerging FX markets were more than offset by gains in developed FX positions, leading to a net profit within the asset class.\nThe Trust showed a small loss in September, with interest rate positions from long-dated securities once again contributing some of the largest Trust profits during September. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments gained as prices rose (yields fell). September had a pronounced risk-off tone that benefitted fixed income holdings due to their attractive safe haven qualities. Overbought conditions in US tech stocks, a lack of progress on another US fiscal stimulus package, some signs that the global economic recovery was stalling, US Presidential election uncertainty, and signs that a new wave of COVID-19 cases was emerging in a variety of regions around the globe all led to the general risk-off malaise. Commodity trading also added gains for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated profits as that market fell over 10% during the month. Swelling inventories linked with cooler temperatures in much of the United States were the catalyst to lower natural gas prices. A short position on gasoil also proved profitable amid anemic demand as the COVID-19 pandemic crimped diesel fuel purchases. Some partially offsetting losses were experienced in long industrial metal and long grain holdings. Prices in these two subsectors were depressed during the month by a strengthening US dollar on flight to safety buying. Foreign exchange trading contributed small losses during the month. Gains in emerging FX markets were more than offset by losses in developed FX positions, leading to a small net loss within the asset class. Stock index trading generated the largest losses for the Trust during September. Long positioning, especially in Europe, Australia, the UK, and Canada, produced losses as indexes in those countries declined amid the risk-off environment that dominated the month. Fresh virus outbreaks in the UK and Europe linked with concerns that the UK and the European Union were headed for a \"no deal\" Brexit weighed on equities in those countries. Falling commodity markets due to US dollar strength and concern over global growth prospects depressed equities in Australia and Canada.\nThe Trust showed a gain in October with profits coming from commodity and FX positions, while stock index and interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Commodity trading drove gains for the Trust. Long positioning on the industrial metals complex profited as prices rallied across the subsector with strengthening fundamentals outweighing concerns over a new wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the US.

The Trust is a successor to the Campbell Fund Limited Partnership (formerly known as the Commodity Trend Fund) which began trading operations in January 1972. The Trust currently trades in the U.S. and international futures, forward and centrally cleared swap markets under the sole direction of Campbell & Company, LP, the managing operator of the Trust. Specifically, the Trust trades in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies, credit and commodities. The Trust is an actively managed account with speculative trading profits as its objective.\nEffective August 31, 2008, the Trust began offering Series A, Series B, and Series W Units. The units in the Trust prior to that date became Series B Units. Series B Units are only available for additional investment by existing holders of Series B Units. Effective August 1, 2017, the Trust began offering Series D units.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate capitalization of the Trust was $279,565,692 with Series A, Series B, Series D and Series W comprising $216,523,843, $32,296,756, $5,043,054 and $25,702,039, respectively, of the total. The Net Asset Value per Unit was $2,579.95 for Series A, $2,837.78 for Series B, $1,059.92 for Series D and $3,112.12 for Series W.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the Financial Statements.\nThe Trust records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements of Operations. Generally, fair values are based on market prices; however, in certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price (i.e., forward contracts which are traded in the inter-bank market).\nCapital Resources\nThe Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust's business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.\nThe Trust generally maintains 60% to 75% of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. After redemptions and additions are taken into account each month, the trade levels of the Trust are adjusted and positions in the instruments the Trust trades are added or liquidated on a pro-rata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels.\nLiquidity\nMost United States futures exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as \"daily price fluctuation limits\" or \"daily limits.\" During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Trust from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Trust to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Trust may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Trust's futures trading operations, the Trust's assets are expected to be highly liquid.\nThe entire offering proceeds, without deductions, will be credited to the Trust's bank, custodial and/or cash management accounts. The Trust meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash and U.S. government securities with the futures broker and the over-the-counter counterparty. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures, forward and swap contracts. The Trust receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Trust assets.\nApproximately 10% to 30% of the Trust's assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury Bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 5% to 15% of the Trust's assets are deposited with the over-the-counter counterparty or centrally cleared in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparty.\nThe managing operator deposits the majority of those assets of the Trust that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in a custodial account with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial account with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial account constitutes approximately 60% to 75% of the Trust's assets and are invested directly by PNC Capital Advisors, LLC (\"PNC\"). PNC is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. PNC does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Trust's assets in the custodial account. PNC invest the assets according to agreed upon investment guidelines that first preserve capital, second allow for sufficient liquidity, and third provide a yield beyond the risk-free rate. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt; and (iv) Asset Backed Securities.\nThe Trust occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparty, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody account at Northern Trust Company to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Trust has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.\nThe Trust's assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell & Company or any affiliated entities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe term \"off-balance sheet risk\" refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Trust trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Trust, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Trust at the same time, and if the Trust's trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Trust, the Trust could lose all of its assets and the Unitholders would realize a 100% loss. Campbell & Company, the managing operator (who also acts as trading advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30% however, these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk of loss.\nIn addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and swap contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Trust. The counterparty for futures contracts and centrally cleared swap contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.\nIn the case of forward contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Campbell & Company trades for the Trust only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Trust are valued each day at fair value. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Trust.\nDisclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value\nThe Trust invests in futures, forward currency, and centrally cleared swap contracts. The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of centrally cleared swap contracts is determined by using currency market quotations provided by an independent external pricing source.\nResults of Operations\nThe returns for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 for Series A were 0.46%, 7.75% and (9.03)%, Series B were 0.97%, 8.29% and (8.66)%, Series D were 1.73%, 7.79% and (8.15)% and Series W were 2.50%, 9.93% and (7.28)% respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued management fees in the amounts of $8,472,866, $12,792,990, and $16,863,539, respectively, and paid management fees in the amounts of $8,990,885, $12,901,756, and $17,499,643, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued sales commissions in the amounts of $2,990,891, $0, and $0, respectively, and paid sales commissions in the amounts of $2,573,244, $0, and $0, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Trust accrued performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $0, respectively, and paid performance fees in the amounts of $0, $21,165, and $3,207.\n2020 (For the Year Ended December 31)\nOf the 0.46% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series A, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.67)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series A.\nOf the 0.97% return for year ended December 31, 2020 for Series B, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (5.16)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions and operating costs borne by Series B.\nOf the 1.73% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series D, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (4.40)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series D.\nOf the 2.50% return for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Series W, approximately 5.03% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 1.10% due to investment income, offset by approximately (3.63)% due to brokerage fees, management fees, sales commissions, offering costs and operating costs borne by Series W.\nAn analysis of the 5.03% gross trading losses for the Trust for the year by sector is as follows:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> Sector\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.08\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commodities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.33\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.63\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Indices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12.32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trust had a strong start to 2020 with gains coming from interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange positions, while stock index holdings provided some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia, Europe, and the United States benefited as prices advanced on a flight to safety bid sparked by the worsening Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. A short position on the Canadian 10-year note created some partially offsetting losses, which were accelerated by downward pressure on yields prompted by a dovish shift by Bank of Canada policymakers. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust in January, with the energy sub-sector realizing the best results. Short positioning on natural gas proved profitable as milder weather across the US weighed on demand prospects. Additional gains were generated from short industrial metal holdings. The base metal complex traded weaker as the coronavirus epidemic raised investor concerns about its negative impact on the Chinese economy. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong dollar as well as technical selling. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed market currencies. Short positions on the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits. The commodity-linked currencies came under pressure as commodity prices sold-off on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials. A long Brazilian real holding produced some partially offsetting losses after risk fell out of favor and investors sold emerging market currencies. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during January. Long positioning across most global stock indexes profited early in the month amid the ratification of the phase one\u201d US-China trade deal, renewed central bank balance sheet expansion, Brexit clarity, and some better than expected US earnings releases. However, profits were relinquished in the second-half of the month as stocks traded lower following risk-off trading as the coronavirus outbreak intensified.\nGains from interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity positions led to a profitable February for the Trust, while stock index holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Long positioning in Australia and the United States continued to benefit as prices advanced on flight to safety buying sparked by the worsening COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic. Investors aggressively sought the safety of fixed income instruments, sending global yields tumbling and expectations for further central bank stimulus soaring. In the foreign exchange sector, positive returns were generated in the developed and emerging market currencies. Short positions on the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone (against long the US dollar) provided some of the best profits for the sector. These commodity-linked currencies came under renewed selling pressure during February. The widening spread of COVID-19 to countries outside of China, such as Japan, South Korea, and Italy, sparked new concerns that global economic growth would slow materially, thus blunting the demand for raw materials. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 outbreak is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling. Global stock index trading produced losses for the Trust during February with the greatest declines seen in Australia, Japan, and the United States. Long positioning across most global stock indexes generally profited during the first two-thirds of the month. However, late in February global stock indexes experienced steep sell-offs sparked by the coronavirus's quick spread to countries outside of China where it initially began. World economic growth fears and supply chain disruption concerns spread rapidly, sending most global stock indexes sharply lower.\nThe Trust had an unprofitable March, with losses coming from stock index and interest rate holdings, while foreign exchange and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Global stock index trading produced the largest losses for the Trust, with the greatest declines seen in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Long positioning across most global stock indexes suffered severely as equity indexes experienced very sharp sell-offs during the month. The COVID-19 virus spread quickly throughout Europe and North America prompting containment measures in the form of stay at home\u201d directives, closures, and shutdowns that sharply curtailed economic activity. Global central banks and governments took unprecedented steps in an effort to soften the financial impact from the virus, but fear over the length and depth of the growth slowdown sent risky assets sharply lower. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed small additional losses during the month. Short positioning on US 10-year notes and US long bonds suffered amid the flight-to-safety scramble that ensued due to the severe economic upheaval wrought by the COVID-19 virus. Long positioning across global short-dated instruments helped to partially offset losses within the sector. Profits were dominated by short positions on the commodity currencies (versus long the USD), specifically in the Norwegian krone. The US dollar was sharply higher during the month amid the extreme flight-to-quality moves. Adding further downward pressure on oil-linked currencies, the petroleum markets sold off severely when tensions escalated between OPEC and Russia, and Saudi Arabia made the decision to ramp up production. Commodity holdings produced additional profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the industrial metal, energy, and meat complexes profited from a decline in prices. The expanding COVID-19 pandemic is widely expected to negatively impact demand for base metal, petroleum, and beef products. Downward price pressure was further intensified by a strong US dollar as well as technical selling.\nThe Trust's losses in April came from foreign exchange and interest rate holdings, while stock index and commodity positions contributed some partially offsetting gains during the month. Short positioning on several of the developed market currencies, namely the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied on a partial lifting of COVID-19 containment measures in those countries. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments contributed additional losses to the portfolio. Long positions on Australian 10-year bonds suffered after the RBA tapered bond-buying operations and the country became one of the first to meaningfully ease lockdown restrictions. Short German Bund positions added to losses as Germany's debt rallied versus periphery European bonds with Germany weathering the effects of COVID-19 better than their Eurozone counterparts. Stock indexes rebounded considerably from the oversold conditions seen during March as the United States and other countries laid out plans to reopen their economies from the COVID-19 lockdown that has proven to be very damaging to local, regional, and global economic growth. The Trust held a mixture of long and short positioning across global stock indexes during the month. Ultimately the gains on long positions more than offset losses experienced on any short holdings, leading to positive net P&L within the sector. Commodity holdings produced additional partially offsetting profits for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the petroleum complex produced a bulk of the sector's profits. Crude oil sold off sharply on the lethal combination of COVID-19 stay at home\u201d induced demand destruction linked with a shortage of available storage capacity. The May WTI futures contract went below zero for the first time in history as long holders scrambled to sell before contract expiration in order to avoid taking physical delivery given the scarcity of demand and lack of available storage space.\nLosses in May once again came from foreign exchange, as well as commodity and stock index holdings, while interest rate positions contributed some gains. May's short positioning on several of the so-called commodity currencies, namely the Norwegian krone and Australian dollar, produced losses when those currencies rallied strongly. Fueling the run-up was a sharp rebound in many beaten down commodity markets, specifically the energy complex, as optimism grew that the worst of the COVID-19 crisis was over. A long position on the Canadian dollar (versus short the US dollar) contributed some partially offsetting gains for the sector on the same commodity currency drivers cited above. Commodity holdings produced additional losses for the Trust during the month. Short positioning on the energy, grain, and industrial metal complexes showed losses as those markets rallied driven by the improving COVID-19 crisis. A long holding on precious metals, specifically silver, produced some partially offsetting gains for the sector as expected industrial demand overwhelmed limited supplies of the metal. Short positioning on stock indexes in Europe and Japan suffered as most global stock indices continued to bounce higher from the March COVID-19 crisis lows. Regional economic re-openings linked with no new major spikes in coronavirus cases fueled the equity optimism. A long position on the Hong Kong Hang Seng index added to sector losses as that market was one of the few global indexes to sell-off during May. China's legislature approved a proposal to impose a highly contentious national security law in the semi-autonomous territory which sparked the regional equity sell-off. Interest rate positions from both long and short-dated instruments contributed partially offsetting gains to the Trust in May. A short position on the German 10-year note was one of the most profitable markets in the sector. The German Bund sold-off during the month (prices lower and yields higher) as signs of improvement in the coronavirus crisis caused traders to shun safe haven assets in favor of riskier ones.\nForeign exchange trading in both the emerging and developed markets produced losses for the Trust during June. The greatest declines were seen in the Norwegian krone, Australian dollar, and certain Latin American currencies. These commodity-linked currencies strengthened to start the month, causing some strategies to cover their previously held long positions, only to reverse those moves later in June. The investor exuberance over additional government stimulus and the economic re-openings quickly wore off on reports of increasing COVID-19 infection outbreaks. Short soft commodity and industrial metal holdings suffered as the dollar weakened early in the month and as optimism over a rapid recovery in economic growth bolstered prices. Short grain positions produced losses on the last trading day of the month as the grain complex rallied sharply after the USDA reported acreage that trailed estimates. Within the energy sub-sector, a short natural gas holding provided some offsetting gains amid plummeting US gas exports as well as shifting weather and market supply dynamics. Meanwhile, stock index trading generated some offsetting gains. The Trust held a mix of long and short positions across the traded universe of indexes and showed a gain in Asia and North America, but partially offsetting losses were realized in Europe. Most global indexes experienced a choppy month amid mixed coronavirus news coupled with hopes for more stimulus from central banks. Interest rate positions from long-dated instruments also contributed small offsetting gains during the month. The Bank of Japan signaled plans to buy more shorter-maturity bonds which caused the yield curve to steepen and benefited our short positioning on longer-dated Japanese government bonds.\nJuly saw losses for the Trust, driven primarily from stock index holdings and foreign exchange trading in the emerging and developed markets. The United States' inability to get the COVID-19 virus under control in the face of other nations of the world seemingly better able to handle the crisis generated concern that US economic growth would lag other countries, leading the FOMC to keep highly accommodative monetary easing in place longer. This dichotomy weakened the US dollar to two-year lows hurting the Trust's long US dollar positioning against many other currencies. Stock index trading also generated losses for the Trust during July. Long positioning, primarily in Asia-Pacific and Europe, produced the bulk of the sector's decline. Late in the month both the Asia-Pacific and European regions began to see an uptick in COVID-19 virus cases. Regional governments were quick to discuss the possibility of once again needing to shutdown economies to halt the spread which led to rapid risk-off sentiment in equity markets leading to lower prices. Commodity trading generated the best partially offsetting profits for the Trust. Long positioning on silver and gold proved profitable as both metals showed strong monthly gains. The aforementioned drivers of US dollar weakness were the primary cause of precious metal subsector gains. Some partially offsetting losses came from the grain and energy subsectors. Short grain holdings generated losses as the grain complex rallied during the month on poor crop conditions in the US Plains. Short positioning on natural gas suffered as high summer electric demand in the US sparked high price volatility that the systematic models failed to trade profitably. Interest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments also contributed gains during July. Long positioning on fixed income instruments profited as prices rose (yields fell) amid US/Chinese geopolitical tensions and as high uncertainty over the course of the COVID-19 crisis led to demand for safe haven assets.\nInterest rate positions from both short-dated and long-dated instruments contributed some of the largest losses for the Trust during August. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments suffered as prices fell (yields rose). The COVID-19 crisis and related emergency fiscal spending has created the need for many governments around the world to finance this spending with new and, in some cases, record levels of debt issuance. That issuance put downward pressure on most global sovereign bond instruments which created losses for the Trust. Commodity trading also experienced sizeable losses for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated large losses as that commodity rose over 30% during the month. Hot temperatures across the United States drove demand for natural gas for electricity generation to power air conditioning while inventory data showed storage at lower than expected levels. Some partially offsetting gains were experienced in long industrial metals positioning. Longs on copper and nickel profited as prices rose amid signs of a global supply shortage in the face of rising demand from countries such as China. Stock index trading generated partially offsetting gains for the Trust during August. Long positioning, especially in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany, produced profits as indexes in those countries experienced strong gains. A lessening of COVID-19 infections, signs that some governments were less willing to renew economic shutdowns to manage the virus crisis, and ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus actions were all supportive of global stocks during the month. Lastly, foreign exchange trading contributed small additional gains during the month. Losses in emerging FX markets were more than offset by gains in developed FX positions, leading to a net profit within the asset class.\nThe Trust showed a small loss in September, with interest rate positions from long-dated securities once again contributing some of the largest Trust profits during September. Long positioning on a variety of global fixed income instruments gained as prices rose (yields fell). September had a pronounced risk-off tone that benefitted fixed income holdings due to their attractive safe haven qualities. Overbought conditions in US tech stocks, a lack of progress on another US fiscal stimulus package, some signs that the global economic recovery was stalling, US Presidential election uncertainty, and signs that a new wave of COVID-19 cases was emerging in a variety of regions around the globe all led to the general risk-off malaise. Commodity trading also added gains for the Trust. A short position on natural gas generated profits as that market fell over 10% during the month. Swelling inventories linked with cooler temperatures in much of the United States were the catalyst to lower natural gas prices. A short position on gasoil also proved profitable amid anemic demand as the COVID-19 pandemic crimped diesel fuel purchases. Some partially offsetting losses were experienced in long industrial metal and long grain holdings. Prices in these two subsectors were depressed during the month by a strengthening US dollar on flight to safety buying. Foreign exchange trading contributed small losses during the month. Gains in emerging FX markets were more than offset by losses in developed FX positions, leading to a small net loss within the asset class. Stock index trading generated the largest losses for the Trust during September. Long positioning, especially in Europe, Australia, the UK, and Canada, produced losses as indexes in those countries declined amid the risk-off environment that dominated the month. Fresh virus outbreaks in the UK and Europe linked with concerns that the UK and the European Union were headed for a \"no deal\" Brexit weighed on equities in those countries. Falling commodity markets due to US dollar strength and concern over global growth prospects depressed equities in Australia and Canada.\nThe Trust showed a gain in October with profits coming from commodity and FX positions, while stock index and interest rate holdings produced some partially offsetting losses. Commodity trading drove gains for the Trust. Long positioning on the industrial metals complex profited as prices rallied across the subsector with strengthening fundamentals outweighing concerns over a new wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the US.
