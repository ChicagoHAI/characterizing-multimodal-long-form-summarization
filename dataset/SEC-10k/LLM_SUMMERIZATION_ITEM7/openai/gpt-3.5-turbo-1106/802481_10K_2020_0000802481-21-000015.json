Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest chicken producers in the world, and as a vertically integrated company, we are able to control every phase of the production process, which helps us manage food safety and quality, control margins and improve customer service. This gives us the opportunity to continue to create growth and development opportunities, further increasing our position as a leading domestic and global protein company. With the acquisition of Pilgrim's Pride Ltd. ( PPL\u201d) and Moy Park in 2019 and 2017, respectively, we solidified ourselves as a leading European food company while diversifying our product mix with introduction into the pork market. With the acquisition of GNP in 2017, we further solidified ourselves as a leading poultry company within the U.S. See Note 2. Business Acquisitions\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information relating to these acquisitions.\nWe reported net income attributable to Pilgrim's Pride Corporation of $94.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, and profit before tax totaling $161.8 million, for 2020. These operating results included gross profit of $838.2 million and generated $724.2 million of cash from operations. We generated operating margins of 2.0% with operating margins of 0.9%, 3.1% and 5.5% in our U.S., U.K. and Europe, and Mexico reportable segments, respectively. During 2020, we generated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of $617.7 million and $788.1 million, respectively. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this annual report.\nAs discussed in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, on October 13, 2020, we announced that we have entered into the Plea Agreement with the DOJ. As a result of the Plea Agreement, we recognized a fine of $110,524,140 as expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we have entered an agreement to settle all claims made by the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class in the In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a fine of $75.0 million as expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Plea Agreement and Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 27, 2020. In addition, as discussed below under Hometown Strong Initiative\u201d, we launched an initiative during 2020 to support the communities in which we operate with unexpected challenges, such as the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic, and as a result, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donation expense related to this initiative during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 27, 2020, which excludes the DOJ antitrust fine, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, increase in donation expense and other items shown in the Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\u201d, was $250.4 million. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d section for a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Pilgrim's to Adjusted net income attributable to Pilgrim's.\nWe operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 52-week accounting cycles.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe extensive impact of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has resulted and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, states, counties and other jurisdictions have imposed various measures, including but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, limitations on gatherings of people, reduced operations and extended closures of businesses. On April 28, 2020, an executive order designated meat and poultry processing plants as critical infrastructure.\nAs the global spread of the virus began to accelerate late in March of 2020, we began to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic included disruptions in supply chain, an increase in both broiler and chick costs and an increase in payroll and benefits costs. During the second quarter of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results generally decreased because of increased demand for our products at retail grocery stores and quick service restaurants and our ability to meet this demand through our transitioned business operations, as further discussed below. We believe that we will continue to experience disruptions and other changes to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic into 2021.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have affected and continue to affect our business in a number of ways.\n\u2022Our workforce. Employee health and safety is our priority. As an essential business in a critical infrastructure industry, we continue to produce chicken and pork products, while coordinating with and implementing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and local and regional Departments of Health in an effort to keep our employees safe and healthy. Measures we have implemented include, but are not limited to: increasing physical distancing of our employees, where possible, by staggering start and shift breaks, placing on-site tents to create more space for employees at break and at meal times, and installing physical barriers to distance employees while working on production lines; adding temperature and symptom screening stations for employees prior to entering our facilities; increasing personal hygiene practices and providing our employees additional personal protective equipment and sanitation stations; and increasing sanitation of our facilities. In the U.S., we provided appreciation bonuses to eligible employees in April and May of 2020 and expanded certain sick leave policies to provide more flexibility. In addition, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\n\u2022Our operations. All of our 60 production facilities are operating, although some facilities have reduced production levels and outputs due to increased health and safety measures, employee absenteeism and as a consequence of the decline in demand by restaurants and other foodservice businesses. To date, we have not experienced a material impact from a plant closure and our facilities have largely been exempt from government closure orders.\n\u2022Demand for our products. COVID-19 and the implementation of restricted living have led to a shift in demand from restaurants to retail grocery stores, with consumers eating more at home due to stay-at-home orders. In our U.S. and Mexico businesses, demand for parts and whole-birds (typically bound for restaurants) and prepared foods (distributed, in part, to schools) has declined, while our U.K. and Europe business, which is more retail focused, has generally seen less of an impact. In an effort to counter the adverse effects of COVID-19, we have transitioned, where commercially reasonable and possible to do so, our business operations to be in the best position to supply COVID-19 market demands. These efforts have included transferring live supply to case ready, shifting production form and mix from foodservice to retail, increasing capacity utilization of retail packaging equipment, and analyzing export positions.\n\u2022Liquidity. Our liquidity position is strong and we have taken additional measures to increase liquidity to prepare for the challenging environment ahead. On March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020, we elected to borrow $200.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, under the U.S. Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The draw-down proceeds borrowed on March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020 were repaid during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\u2022Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. During the year ended December 27, 2020, we experienced increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, in part related to the uncertainty from COVID-19, as well as actions taken by governments and central banks in response to COVID-19.\n\u2022CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which includes modifications to the limitation on business interest expense and net operating loss provisions, and provides a payment delay of employer payroll taxes during 2020 after the date of enactment. We estimate the payment of approximately $51 million of employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022.\nRaw Materials\nOur profitability is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken. Our U.S. and Mexico reportable segments use corn and soybean meal as the main ingredients for feed production, while our U.K. and Europe reportable segment uses wheat, soybean meal and barley as the main ingredients for feed production.\nDuring fiscal 2020, chicken prices in the market were volatile, beginning the fiscal year on the low end and then subsequently stabilizing and improving by the end of the fiscal year. In particular, during the first quarter of 2020, market prices for chicken trended near the bottom of the historical range while sustaining prices sufficiently higher than the cost of feed and ingredients to provide positive margins. During this time, the industry experienced increased production compared to the first quarter of 2019. The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent market reactions late into the first quarter of 2020 resulted in an unexpected shift in demand from foodservice to retail markets, triggering a shift in supply and demand, causing volatility in market prices. The industry adjusted through reductions of egg sets and chick placements, which continued to trend throughout the year ended December 27, 2020, resulting in reduced broiler production in the last half of 2020. Reduced broiler production coincided with robust retail demand, quickly recovering foodservice throughout the second half of 2020, which had\nsignificantly improved over the low point during the second quarter of 2020. As a result, chicken market prices stabilized moving into the third quarter, and even improved in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year.\nWhile chicken prices have improved in the second half of 2020, prices in 2021 will depend on the recovery of the foodservice industry, influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, government regulation, uncertainty surrounding the general economy and protein supply.\nHometown Strong Initiative\nThe Hometown Strong initiative was developed in order to help the communities in which we operate respond to the unexpected challenges on society, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the Hometown Strong initiative will provide consequential investment projects for a lasting impact on these communities and help them prepare for unanticipated challenges and build for the future. For 2020, we committed to Hometown Strong donations of $20.0 million and during the year ended December 27, 2020, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donations expense relating to this initiative.\nPotential Impact of Tariffs\nWe continue to monitor recent trade and tariff activity and its potential impact to exports and inputs costs across our reportable segments. Currently, we are experiencing impacts to domestic and export prices of chicken resulting from uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs. With the implementation of the EU-U.K Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there is uncertainty regarding the processing of imports and administration costs that will follow. This could lead to potential new tariffs and regulations from both the European Union and the U.K. We are unable to give any assurance as to the scope, duration, or impact of any changes in trade policies or tariffs, how successful any mitigation efforts will be, or the extent to which mitigation will be necessary, and accordingly, changes in trade policies and increased tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nReportable Segments\nWe operate in three reportable segments: the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, and Mexico. We measure segment profit as operating income. Corporate expenses are allocated to Mexico and U.K. and Europe reportable segments based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the U.S. For additional information, see Note 19. Reportable Segments\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\nResults of Operations\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNet sales. Net sales for 2020 increased $682.7 million, or 6.0%, from $11.4 billion generated in 2019 to $12.1 billion generated in 2020. The following table provides additional information regarding net sales:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,496,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,699) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. and Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>3,274,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>890,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico </td> <td> </td> <td>1,321,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67,118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,091,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>682,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Reportable Segment. U.S. net sales generated in 2020 decreased $140.7 million, or 1.8%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2019 primarily because of a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $188.2 million, or 2.4 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales. This decrease in net sales per pound was partially offset by $47.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, due to an increase in sales volume.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2020 increased $890.5 million, or 37.4%, from U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2019, primarily because of the recently acquired PPL operations, partially offset by a decrease in net sales by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. The impact of the acquired business contributed $1.1 billion, or 44.3 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The decrease in our existing U.K. and Europe operations was driven by a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $159.6 million, or 6.7 percentage points, and $14.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively, to the decrease in net sales. These decreases in sales volume and net sales\nper pound were partially offset by $8.0 million, or 0.4 percentage points, due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Mexico sales generated in 2020 decreased $67.1 million, or 4.8%, from Mexico sales generated in 2019 primarily because of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by an increase in net sales per pound. The impact of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased sales volume contributed $154.9 million, or 11.1 percentage points, and $22.1 million, or 1.6 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales. Partially offsetting these decreases in net sales by $109.9 million, or 7.9 percentage points, was an increase in net sales per pound.\nGross profit. Gross profit decreased by $232.2 million, or 21.7%, from $1.1 billion generated in 2019 to $838.2 million generated in 2020. The following tables provide gross profit information:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Net Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,091,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>682,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>11,253,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>914,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>90.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>838,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(232,198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(233,014) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. and Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>218,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico </td> <td> </td> <td>118,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,137) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>838,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(232,198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,995,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. and Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>3,055,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>843,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico </td> <td> </td> <td>1,202,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,981) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(473) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(377) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,253,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>914,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of our company and our majority owned subsidiaries. We eliminate all significant affiliate accounts and transactions upon consolidation.\nU.S. Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2020 increased $92.3 million, or 1.3%, from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2019. Cost of sales increased primarily because of increased cost per pound sold and increased poultry sales volume of $49.3 million, or 0.7 percentage points, and $43.0 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively. Included in the increase in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a $43.4 million increase in live input costs, a $34.6 million increase in benefits costs mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an $18.0 million increase in depreciation costs, a $16.9 million increase in payroll costs due to higher pay rates, a $15.8 million increase in outside service costs from increased outside processing labor and a $15.6 million increase in insurance costs, mainly from higher workers' compensation costs. Partially offsetting these increases in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a decrease in derivative expense of $59.9 million resulting from higher realized losses on commodity derivatives in 2019. Other factors affecting U.S. cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $843.9 million, or 38.2%, from cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of costs incurred by the acquired PPL operations, partially offset by decreases in cost of sales incurred by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. Cost of sales incurred by the acquired PPL operations contributed $1.0 billion, or 45.9 percentage points, to the increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales related to the existing U.K. and Europe operations decreased $169.7 million, or 7.7 percentage points, due to a decrease in poultry sales volume and a decrease in cost per pound sold of $147.1 million and\n$29.9 million, respectively. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by the $7.3 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decrease in cost per pound sold is due to the adjusted product mix from foodservice to retail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 decreased $21.0 million, or 1.7%, from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of the favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased poultry sales volume of $141.0 million, or 11.5 percentage points, and $19.4 million, or 1.6 percentage points, respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases in cost of sales was an increase of $139.4 million, or 11.4 percentage points in cost per pound sold. Included in the decreased poultry sales volume and increased cost per pound sold was a $73.7 million increase in poultry input costs due to increased grain and ingredient costs.

Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2020 increased $184.8 million, or 75.0%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2019 primarily from the $110.5 million DOJ agreement, the $75.0 million Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, $15.0 million in incremental donations expense related to the Hometown Strong initiative and a $25.6 million increase in professional fees mainly due to increased legal representation services. These increases in SG&A expense were partially offset by a $20.0 million decrease in payroll and benefit costs due to decreased incentive and stock-based compensation. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $22.9 million, or 24.7%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of expenses incurred by the acquired PPL operations of $25.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense incurred from our existing U.K. and Europe operations of $2.8 million. The decrease in SG&A expense in our existing U.K. and Europe was mainly due to a $2.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $2.0 million decrease in legal and other professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 increased $5.0 million, or 12.2%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of a $2.4 million increase in employee relations expenses and a $1.5 million increase in professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense decreased 4.9% to $126.1 million in 2020 from $132.6 million in 2019, primarily because of a decrease in weighted average interest rates to 4.7% in 2020 from 5.3% in 2019. As a percent of net sales, interest expense in 2020 and 2019 was 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively.\nIncome taxes. Our consolidated income tax expense in 2020 was $66.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $161.0 million in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense in 2020 resulted from a decrease in pre-tax income during 2020.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet sales. Net sales for 2019 increased $471.4 million, or 4.3%, from $10.9 billion generated in 2018 to $11.4 billion generated in 2019. The following table provides additional information regarding net sales:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,636,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. and Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>2,383,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico </td> <td> </td> <td>1,388,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,409,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Reportable Segment. U.S. net sales generated in 2019 increased $211.1 million, or 2.8%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2018 primarily because of an increase in sales volume and an increase in net sales per pound. The increase in sales volume contributed $139.6 million, or 1.8 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The increase in net sales per pound contributed $71.5 million, or 1.0 percentage points, to the increase in net sales.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2019 increased $235.1 million, or 10.9%, from U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2018, primarily because of the recently acquired PPL operations, partially offset by a decrease in net sales by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. The impact of the acquired business contributed $306.7 million, or 14.2 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The decrease in our existing U.K. and Europe operations was mainly due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $94.4 million, or 4.4 percentage points. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was partially offset by an increase in sales volume and net sales per pound of $15.3 million, or 0.7 percentage points, and $7.6 million, or 0.4 percentage points, respectively.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Mexico sales generated in 2019 increased $25.3 million, or 1.9%, from Mexico sales generated in 2018 primarily because of an increase in net sales per pound, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement. The increase in net sales per pound contributed $59.2 million, or 4.4 percentage points, to the increase in Mexico net sales. The decrease in sales volume and unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement partially offset the increase in net sales per pound by $32.1 million, or 2.4 percentage points, and $1.8 million, or 0.1 percentage points, respectively.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased by $226.9 million, or 26.9%, from $843.5 million generated in 2018 to $1.1 billion generated in 2019.

Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2019 decreased $6.5 million, or 0.1%, from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2018. Cost of sales primarily decreased because of reduced cost per pound sold, partially offset by increased poultry sales volume. The decrease in cost per pound sold contributed $92.6 million to the decrease in cost of sales. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in poultry sales volume of $86.0 million. Included in the decrease in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was an $81.2 million increase in hourly labor due to an increase in required labor for reduced use of third-party poultry processors and a $15.1 million increase in contracted processing labor. Partially offsetting these increases in cost of sales was a $16.0 million decrease in freight cost due to decreased contract rates, $14.9 million in costs in 2018 relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Maria, a $14.8 million decrease in commodity and currency derivative losses, an $11.3 million decrease in feed costs, a $9.2 million decrease in cost relating to third-party poultry processors and a $5.7 million decrease in property taxes. Other factors affecting U.S. cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 increased $234.2 million, or 11.8%, from cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2018 primarily because of costs incurred by the acquired PPL operations, partially offset by decreases in cost of sales incurred by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. Cost of sales incurred by the acquired PPL operations contributed $297.5 million to the increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales related to the existing U.K. and Europe operations decreased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $87.1 million, partially offset by an increase in poultry sales volume of $14.1 million and an increase in cost per pound sold of $9.6 million. Included in the increase in sales volume and cost per pound was a $22.8 million increase in payroll cost due to national minimum wage increases, a $7.8 million increase in maintenance costs due to additional equipment and production lines and a $4.4 million increase in utilities as a result of increased rates. Partially offsetting these increases in cost of sales was a $12.7 million decrease in live costs mainly due to increased efficiencies. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 increased $16.8 million, or 1.4%, from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2018 primarily because of increased cost per pound sold. The increase in cost per pound sold was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume and the favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement. The increase in cost per pound sold contributed $46.8 million to the increase in cost of sales. Partially offsetting this increase in cost of sales was the decrease in sales volume of $28.4 million and favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement of $1.6 million. Included in the increase in cost per pound sold and sales volume decrease was a $16.1 million increase in grower pay due to increased live operations and a $5.7 million increase in freight costs. Partially offsetting these increases in cost of sales was a $6.6 million increase in gains on sale of assets during 2019. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nOperating income.

Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2019 increased $23.9 million, or 10.8%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2018 primarily because of a $17.7 million increase in incentive compensation expenses and a $7.0 million increase in legal fees due to increased litigation. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nAdministrative restructuring activities incurred by the U.S. operations during 2019 decreased $2.2 million, or 103.9%, from administrative restructuring activities incurred during 2018. Administrative restructuring activities incurred by the U.S. reportable segment during 2019 included $84,000 of sublease income related to the termination of 40 North Foods operations. Administrative restructuring activities incurred by the U.S. reportable segment during 2018 included severance costs totaling $1.0 million related to GNP, facility closure costs totaling $0.5 million related to the Luverne, Minnesota facility and severance, asset impairment and lease obligations costs totaling $0.7 million that resulted from the termination of the 40 North Foods operation.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 increased $8.9 million, or 10.6%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2018 primarily because of expenses incurred by the acquired PPL operations, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense incurred from our existing U.K. and Europe operations. SG&A expense incurred by the acquired PPL operations contributed $13.1 million to the increase in SG&A expense. The decrease in SG&A expense in our existing U.K. and Europe was mainly due to favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3.3 million. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nAdministrative restructuring activities incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 decreased $2.6 million, or 100.0%, from administrative restructuring activities incurred during 2018. During 2018, administrative restructuring activities represented impairment costs of $2.6 million related to Rose Energy Ltd.\nMexico Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 increased $4.1 million, or 11.0%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2018 primarily because of a $2.3 million increase in payroll mainly due to increased rates and a $1.1 million increase marketing expenses due to increased brand development. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense decreased 18.5% to $132.6 million in 2019 from $162.8 million in 2018, primarily because of a decrease in average borrowings to $2.3 billion in 2019 from $2.5 billion in 2018. As a percent of net sales, interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively.\nIncome taxes. Our consolidated income tax expense in 2019 was $161.0 million, compared to income tax expense of $85.4 million in 2018. The increase in income tax expense in 2019 resulted from an increase in pre-tax income during 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings, and existing cash on hand.

General.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets, litigation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. The vast majority of our revenue is derived from contracts which are based upon a customer ordering our products. While there may be master agreements, the contract is only established when the customer's order is accepted by us. We account for a contract, which may be verbal or written, when it is approved and committed by both parties, the rights of the parties are identified along with payment terms, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable.\nWe evaluate the transaction for distinct performance obligations, which are the sale of our products to customers. Since our products are commodity market-priced, the sales price is representative of the observable, standalone selling price. Each performance obligation is recognized based upon a pattern of recognition that reflects the transfer of control to the customer at a point in time, which is upon destination (customer location or port of destination) and depicts the transfer of control and recognition of revenue. There are instances of customer pick-up at our facilities, in which case control transfers to the customer at that point and we recognize revenue. Our performance obligations are typically fulfilled within days to weeks of the acceptance of the order.\nWe make judgments regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from revenue and cash flows with customers. Determination of a contract requires evaluation and judgment along with the estimation of the total contract value and if any of the contract value is constrained. Due to the nature of our business, there is minimal variable consideration, as the contract is established at the acceptance of the order from the customer. When applicable, variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated on a regular basis until the contract is completed. Allocating the transaction price to a specific performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling prices includes estimating the standalone selling prices including discounts and variable consideration.\nInventory. Live chicken inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and breeder hen inventories at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value. The costs associated with breeder hen inventories are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive lives using the unit-of-production method. Finished poultry products, feed, eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average) or net realizable value. Inventory typically transfers from one stage of production to another at a standard cost, where it accumulates additional cost directly incurred with the production of inventory, including overhead. The standard cost at which each type of inventory transfers is set by management to reflect the actual costs incurred in the prior steps. We monitor and adjust standard costs throughout the year to ensure that standard costs reasonably reflect the actual average cost of the inventory produced.\nWe allocate meat costs between our various finished chicken products based on a by-product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This primarily includes leg quarters, wings, tenders and offal, which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts, with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost. Generally, we perform an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or market adjustments are required at the country level based on a number of factors, including: (1) pools of related inventory, (2) product continuation or discontinuation, (3) estimated market selling prices and (4) expected distribution channels. If actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required.\nWe also record valuation adjustments, when necessary, for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence, including significantly aged products, discontinued product lines, or damaged or obsolete products.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles, net. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Identified intangible assets represent trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements arising from acquisitions that are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization, if any. We use various market valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its identified intangible assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. For goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine if an indication of impairment exists for a\nreporting unit. If management determines there is an indication that the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill might be impaired, a quantitative analysis is performed. Management performed a qualitative analysis noting no indications of goodwill impairment in any of its reporting units as of December 27, 2020. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value of that intangible asset. Management first reviews relevant qualitative factors to determine if an indication of impairment exists. If management determines there is an indication that the carrying amount of the intangible asset might be impaired, and quantitative analysis is performed. Management performed a qualitative analysis noting no indications of impairment for any of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 27, 2020.\nIdentifiable intangible assets with definite lives, such as customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names that we expect to use for a limited amount of time, are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The useful lives range from three to 20 years for non-compete agreements and trade names and three to 16 years for customer relationships. Identified intangible assets with definite lives are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management assessed if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the aggregate carrying amount of its identified intangible assets with definite lives might not be recoverable and determined that there were no impairment indicators during the year ended December 27, 2020 and year ended December 29, 2019.\nLitigation and Contingent Liabilities. We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to employment, environmental, product, and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, to these matters. We estimate the amount of reserves required for these contingencies when losses are determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We expense legal costs related to such loss contingencies as they are incurred. With respect to our environmental remediation obligations, the accrual for environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an undiscounted basis. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in our assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies, or other factors beyond our control.\nIncome Taxes. We follow provisions under ASC No. 740-10-30-27 in the Expenses-Income Taxes topic with regard to members of a group that file a consolidated tax return but issue separate financial statements. We file our U.S. federal tax return and certain state unitary returns with JBS USA Holdings. Our income tax expense is computed using the separate return method. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. For the unitary states, we have an obligation to make tax payments to JBS USA Holdings for our share of the unitary taxable income, which is included in taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred tax on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on the tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions as a part of the income tax provision.", "summary": "The report details the financial performance and operations of a leading chicken producer, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest chicken producers in the world, and as a vertically integrated company, we are able to control every phase of the production process, which helps us manage food safety and quality, control margins and improve customer service. This gives us the opportunity to continue to create growth and development opportunities, further increasing our position as a leading domestic and global protein company. With the acquisition of Pilgrim's Pride Ltd. ( PPL\u201d) and Moy Park in 2019 and 2017, respectively, we solidified ourselves as a leading European food company while diversifying our product mix with introduction into the pork market. With the acquisition of GNP in 2017, we further solidified ourselves as a leading poultry company within the U.S. See Note 2. Business Acquisitions\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information relating to these acquisitions.\nWe reported net income attributable to Pilgrim's Pride Corporation of $94.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, and profit before tax totaling $161.8 million, for 2020. These operating results included gross profit of $838.2 million and generated $724.2 million of cash from operations. We generated operating margins of 2.0% with operating margins of 0.9%, 3.1% and 5.5% in our U.S., U.K. and Europe, and Mexico reportable segments, respectively. During 2020, we generated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of $617.7 million and $788.1 million, respectively. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this annual report.\nAs discussed in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, on October 13, 2020, we announced that we have entered into the Plea Agreement with the DOJ. As a result of the Plea Agreement, we recognized a fine of $110,524,140 as expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we have entered an agreement to settle all claims made by the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class in the In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a fine of $75.0 million as expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Plea Agreement and Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 27, 2020. In addition, as discussed below under Hometown Strong Initiative\u201d, we launched an initiative during 2020 to support the communities in which we operate with unexpected challenges, such as the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic, and as a result, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donation expense related to this initiative during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 27, 2020, which excludes the DOJ antitrust fine, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, increase in donation expense and other items shown in the Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\u201d, was $250.4 million. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d section for a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Pilgrim's to Adjusted net income attributable to Pilgrim's.\nWe operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 52-week accounting cycles.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe extensive impact of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has resulted and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, states, counties and other jurisdictions have imposed various measures, including but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, limitations on gatherings of people, reduced operations and extended closures of businesses. On April 28, 2020, an executive order designated meat and poultry processing plants as critical infrastructure.\nAs the global spread of the virus began to accelerate late in March of 2020, we began to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic included disruptions in supply chain, an increase in both broiler and chick costs and an increase in payroll and benefits costs. During the second quarter of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results generally decreased because of increased demand for our products at retail grocery stores and quick service restaurants and our ability to meet this demand through our transitioned business operations, as further discussed below. We believe that we will continue to experience disruptions and other changes to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic into 2021.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have affected and continue to affect our business in a number of ways.\n\u2022Our workforce. Employee health and safety is our priority. As an essential business in a critical infrastructure industry, we continue to produce chicken and pork products, while coordinating with and implementing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and local and regional Departments of Health in an effort to keep our employees safe and healthy. Measures we have implemented include, but are not limited to: increasing physical distancing of our employees, where possible, by staggering start and shift breaks, placing on-site tents to create more space for employees at break and at meal times, and installing physical barriers to distance employees while working on production lines; adding temperature and symptom screening stations for employees prior to entering our facilities; increasing personal hygiene practices and providing our employees additional personal protective equipment and sanitation stations; and increasing sanitation of our facilities. In the U.S., we provided appreciation bonuses to eligible employees in April and May of 2020 and expanded certain sick leave policies to provide more flexibility. In addition, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\n\u2022Our operations. All of our 60 production facilities are operating, although some facilities have reduced production levels and outputs due to increased health and safety measures, employee absenteeism and as a consequence of the decline in demand by restaurants and other foodservice businesses. To date, we have not experienced a material impact from a plant closure and our facilities have largely been exempt from government closure orders.\n\u2022Demand for our products. COVID-19 and the implementation of restricted living have led to a shift in demand from restaurants to retail grocery stores, with consumers eating more at home due to stay-at-home orders. In our U.S. and Mexico businesses, demand for parts and whole-birds (typically bound for restaurants) and prepared foods (distributed, in part, to schools) has declined, while our U.K. and Europe business, which is more retail focused, has generally seen less of an impact. In an effort to counter the adverse effects of COVID-19, we have transitioned, where commercially reasonable and possible to do so, our business operations to be in the best position to supply COVID-19 market demands. These efforts have included transferring live supply to case ready, shifting production form and mix from foodservice to retail, increasing capacity utilization of retail packaging equipment, and analyzing export positions.\n\u2022Liquidity. Our liquidity position is strong and we have taken additional measures to increase liquidity to prepare for the challenging environment ahead. On March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020, we elected to borrow $200.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, under the U.S. Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The draw-down proceeds borrowed on March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020 were repaid during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\u2022Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. During the year ended December 27, 2020, we experienced increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, in part related to the uncertainty from COVID-19, as well as actions taken by governments and central banks in response to COVID-19.\n\u2022CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which includes modifications to the limitation on business interest expense and net operating loss provisions, and provides a payment delay of employer payroll taxes during 2020 after the date of enactment. We estimate the payment of approximately $51 million of employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022.\nRaw Materials\nOur profitability is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken. Our U.S. and Mexico reportable segments use corn and soybean meal as the main ingredients for feed production, while our U.K. and Europe reportable segment uses wheat, soybean meal and barley as the main ingredients for feed production.\nDuring fiscal 2020, chicken prices in the market were volatile, beginning the fiscal year on the low end and then subsequently stabilizing and improving by the end of the fiscal year. In particular, during the first quarter of 2020, market prices for chicken trended near the bottom of the historical range while sustaining prices sufficiently higher than the cost of feed and ingredients to provide positive margins. During this time, the industry experienced increased production compared to the first quarter of 2019. The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent market reactions late into the first quarter of 2020 resulted in an unexpected shift in demand from foodservice to retail markets, triggering a shift in supply and demand, causing volatility in market prices. The industry adjusted through reductions of egg sets and chick placements, which continued to trend throughout the year ended December 27, 2020, resulting in reduced broiler production in the last half of 2020. Reduced broiler production coincided with robust retail demand, quickly recovering foodservice throughout the second half of 2020, which had\nsignificantly improved over the low point during the second quarter of 2020. As a result, chicken market prices stabilized moving into the third quarter, and even improved in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year.\nWhile chicken prices have improved in the second half of 2020, prices in 2021 will depend on the recovery of the foodservice industry, influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, government regulation, uncertainty surrounding the general economy and protein supply.\nHometown Strong Initiative\nThe Hometown Strong initiative was developed in order to help the communities in which we operate respond to the unexpected challenges on society, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the Hometown Strong initiative will provide consequential investment projects for a lasting impact on these communities and help them prepare for unanticipated challenges and build for the future. For 2020, we committed to Hometown Strong donations of $20.0 million and during the year ended December 27, 2020, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donations expense relating to this initiative.\nPotential Impact of Tariffs\nWe continue to monitor recent trade and tariff activity and its potential impact to exports and inputs costs across our reportable segments. Currently, we are experiencing impacts to domestic and export prices of chicken resulting from uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs. With the implementation of the EU-U.K Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there is uncertainty regarding the processing of imports and administration costs that will follow. This could lead to potential new tariffs and regulations from both the European Union and the U.K. We are unable to give any assurance as to the scope, duration, or impact of any changes in trade policies or tariffs, how successful any mitigation efforts will be, or the extent to which mitigation will be necessary, and accordingly, changes in trade policies and increased tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nReportable Segments\nWe operate in three reportable segments: the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, and Mexico. We measure segment profit as operating income. Corporate expenses are allocated to Mexico and U.K. and Europe reportable segments based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the U.S. For additional information, see Note 19. Reportable Segments\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\nResults of Operations\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNet sales. Net sales for 2020 increased $682.7 million, or 6.0%, from $11.4 billion generated in 2019 to $12.1 billion generated in 2020. The following table provides additional information regarding net sales:\n\nU.S. Reportable Segment. U.S. net sales generated in 2020 decreased $140.7 million, or 1.8%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2019 primarily because of a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $188.2 million, or 2.4 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales. This decrease in net sales per pound was partially offset by $47.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, due to an increase in sales volume.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2020 increased $890.5 million, or 37.4%, from U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2019, primarily because of the recently acquired PPL operations, partially offset by a decrease in net sales by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. The impact of the acquired business contributed $1.1 billion, or 44.3 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The decrease in our existing U.K. and Europe operations was driven by a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $159.6 million, or 6.7 percentage points, and $14.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively, to the decrease in net sales. These decreases in sales volume and net sales\nper pound were partially offset by $8.0 million, or 0.4 percentage points, due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Mexico sales generated in 2020 decreased $67.1 million, or 4.8%, from Mexico sales generated in 2019 primarily because of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by an increase in net sales per pound. The impact of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased sales volume contributed $154.9 million, or 11.1 percentage points, and $22.1 million, or 1.6 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales. Partially offsetting these decreases in net sales by $109.9 million, or 7.9 percentage points, was an increase in net sales per pound.\nGross profit. Gross profit decreased by $232.2 million, or 21.7%, from $1.1 billion generated in 2019 to $838.2 million generated in 2020. The following tables provide gross profit information:\n\n\n\n(a)Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of our company and our majority owned subsidiaries. We eliminate all significant affiliate accounts and transactions upon consolidation.\nU.S. Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2020 increased $92.3 million, or 1.3%, from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2019. Cost of sales increased primarily because of increased cost per pound sold and increased poultry sales volume of $49.3 million, or 0.7 percentage points, and $43.0 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively. Included in the increase in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a $43.4 million increase in live input costs, a $34.6 million increase in benefits costs mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an $18.0 million increase in depreciation costs, a $16.9 million increase in payroll costs due to higher pay rates, a $15.8 million increase in outside service costs from increased outside processing labor and a $15.6 million increase in insurance costs, mainly from higher workers' compensation costs. Partially offsetting these increases in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a decrease in derivative expense of $59.9 million resulting from higher realized losses on commodity derivatives in 2019. Other factors affecting U.S. cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $843.9 million, or 38.2%, from cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of costs incurred by the acquired PPL operations, partially offset by decreases in cost of sales incurred by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. Cost of sales incurred by the acquired PPL operations contributed $1.0 billion, or 45.9 percentage points, to the increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales related to the existing U.K. and Europe operations decreased $169.7 million, or 7.7 percentage points, due to a decrease in poultry sales volume and a decrease in cost per pound sold of $147.1 million and\n$29.9 million, respectively. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by the $7.3 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decrease in cost per pound sold is due to the adjusted product mix from foodservice to retail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 decreased $21.0 million, or 1.7%, from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of the favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased poultry sales volume of $141.0 million, or 11.5 percentage points, and $19.4 million, or 1.6 percentage points, respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases in cost of sales was an increase of $139.4 million, or 11.4 percentage points in cost per pound sold. Included in the decreased poultry sales volume and increased cost per pound sold was a $73.7 million increase in poultry input costs due to increased grain and ingredient costs. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nOperating income. Operating income decreased $445.1 million, or 64.5%, from $690.6 million generated for 2019 to $245.5 million generated for 2020. The following tables provide operating income information:\n\n\n\nU.S. Reportable Segment. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2020 increased $184.8 million, or 75.0%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2019 primarily from the $110.5 million DOJ agreement, the $75.0 million Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, $15.0 million in incremental donations expense related to the Hometown Strong initiative and a $25.6 million increase in professional fees mainly due to increased legal representation services. These increases in SG&A expense were partially offset by a $20.0 million decrease in payroll and benefit costs due to decreased incentive and stock-based compensation. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $22.9 million, or 24.7%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of expenses incurred by the acquired PPL operations of $25.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense incurred from our existing U.K. and Europe operations of $2.8 million. The decrease in SG&A expense in our existing U.K. and Europe was mainly due to a $2.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $2.0 million decrease in legal and other professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 increased $5.0 million, or 12.2%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of a $2.4 million increase in employee relations expenses and a $1.5 million increase in professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense decreased 4.9% to $126.1 million in 2020 from $132.6 million in 2019, primarily because of a decrease in weighted average interest rates to 4.7% in 2020 from 5.3% in 2019. As a percent of net sales, interest expense in 2020 and 2019 was 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively.\nIncome taxes. Our consolidated income tax expense in 2020 was $66.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $161.0 million in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense in 2020 resulted from a decrease in pre-tax income during 2020.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet sales. Net sales for 2019 increased $471.4 million, or 4.3%, from $10.9 billion generated in 2018 to $11.4 billion generated in 2019. The following table provides additional information regarding net sales:\n\nU.S. Reportable Segment. U.S. net sales generated in 2019 increased $211.1 million, or 2.8%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2018 primarily because of an increase in sales volume and an increase in net sales per pound. The increase in sales volume contributed $139.6 million, or 1.8 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The increase in net sales per pound contributed $71.5 million, or 1.0 percentage points, to the increase in net sales.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2019 increased $235.1 million, or 10.9%, from U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2018, primarily because of the recently", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest chicken producers in the world, and as a vertically integrated company, we are able to control every phase of the production process, which helps us manage food safety and quality, control margins and improve customer service. This gives us the opportunity to continue to create growth and development opportunities, further increasing our position as a leading domestic and global protein company. With the acquisition of Pilgrim's Pride Ltd. ( PPL\u201d) and Moy Park in 2019 and 2017, respectively, we solidified ourselves as a leading European food company while diversifying our product mix with introduction into the pork market. With the acquisition of GNP in 2017, we further solidified ourselves as a leading poultry company within the U.S. See Note 2. Business Acquisitions\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information relating to these acquisitions.\nWe reported net income attributable to Pilgrim's Pride Corporation of $94.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, and profit before tax totaling $161.8 million, for 2020. These operating results included gross profit of $838.2 million and generated $724.2 million of cash from operations. We generated operating margins of 2.0% with operating margins of 0.9%, 3.1% and 5.5% in our U.S., U.K. and Europe, and Mexico reportable segments, respectively. During 2020, we generated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of $617.7 million and $788.1 million, respectively. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this annual report.\nAs discussed in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, on October 13, 2020, we announced that we have entered into the Plea Agreement with the DOJ. As a result of the Plea Agreement, we recognized a fine of $110,524,140 as expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we have entered an agreement to settle all claims made by the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class in the In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a fine of $75.0 million as expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Plea Agreement and Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 27, 2020. In addition, as discussed below under Hometown Strong Initiative\u201d, we launched an initiative during 2020 to support the communities in which we operate with unexpected challenges, such as the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic, and as a result, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donation expense related to this initiative during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 27, 2020, which excludes the DOJ antitrust fine, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, increase in donation expense and other items shown in the Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\u201d, was $250.4 million. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d section for a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Pilgrim's to Adjusted net income attributable to Pilgrim's.\nWe operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 52-week accounting cycles.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe extensive impact of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has resulted and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, states, counties and other jurisdictions have imposed various measures, including but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, limitations on gatherings of people, reduced operations and extended closures of businesses. On April 28, 2020, an executive order designated meat and poultry processing plants as critical infrastructure.\nAs the global spread of the virus began to accelerate late in March of 2020, we began to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic included disruptions in supply chain, an increase in both broiler and chick costs and an increase in payroll and benefits costs. During the second quarter of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results generally decreased because of increased demand for our products at retail grocery stores and quick service restaurants and our ability to meet this demand through our transitioned business operations, as further discussed below. We believe that we will continue to experience disruptions and other changes to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic into 2021.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have affected and continue to affect our business in a number of ways.\n\u2022Our workforce. Employee health and safety is our priority. As an essential business in a critical infrastructure industry, we continue to produce chicken and pork products, while coordinating with and implementing guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and local and regional Departments of Health in an effort to keep our employees safe and healthy. Measures we have implemented include, but are not limited to: increasing physical distancing of our employees, where possible, by staggering start and shift breaks, placing on-site tents to create more space for employees at break and at meal times, and installing physical barriers to distance employees while working on production lines; adding temperature and symptom screening stations for employees prior to entering our facilities; increasing personal hygiene practices and providing our employees additional personal protective equipment and sanitation stations; and increasing sanitation of our facilities. In the U.S., we provided appreciation bonuses to eligible employees in April and May of 2020 and expanded certain sick leave policies to provide more flexibility. In addition, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely.\n\u2022Our operations. All of our 60 production facilities are operating, although some facilities have reduced production levels and outputs due to increased health and safety measures, employee absenteeism and as a consequence of the decline in demand by restaurants and other foodservice businesses. To date, we have not experienced a material impact from a plant closure and our facilities have largely been exempt from government closure orders.\n\u2022Demand for our products. COVID-19 and the implementation of restricted living have led to a shift in demand from restaurants to retail grocery stores, with consumers eating more at home due to stay-at-home orders. In our U.S. and Mexico businesses, demand for parts and whole-birds (typically bound for restaurants) and prepared foods (distributed, in part, to schools) has declined, while our U.K. and Europe business, which is more retail focused, has generally seen less of an impact. In an effort to counter the adverse effects of COVID-19, we have transitioned, where commercially reasonable and possible to do so, our business operations to be in the best position to supply COVID-19 market demands. These efforts have included transferring live supply to case ready, shifting production form and mix from foodservice to retail, increasing capacity utilization of retail packaging equipment, and analyzing export positions.\n\u2022Liquidity. Our liquidity position is strong and we have taken additional measures to increase liquidity to prepare for the challenging environment ahead. On March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020, we elected to borrow $200.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, under the U.S. Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The draw-down proceeds borrowed on March 20, 2020 and March 25, 2020 were repaid during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\u2022Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. During the year ended December 27, 2020, we experienced increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, in part related to the uncertainty from COVID-19, as well as actions taken by governments and central banks in response to COVID-19.\n\u2022CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which includes modifications to the limitation on business interest expense and net operating loss provisions, and provides a payment delay of employer payroll taxes during 2020 after the date of enactment. We estimate the payment of approximately $51 million of employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 31, 2022.\nRaw Materials\nOur profitability is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken. Our U.S. and Mexico reportable segments use corn and soybean meal as the main ingredients for feed production, while our U.K. and Europe reportable segment uses wheat, soybean meal and barley as the main ingredients for feed production.\nDuring fiscal 2020, chicken prices in the market were volatile, beginning the fiscal year on the low end and then subsequently stabilizing and improving by the end of the fiscal year. In particular, during the first quarter of 2020, market prices for chicken trended near the bottom of the historical range while sustaining prices sufficiently higher than the cost of feed and ingredients to provide positive margins. During this time, the industry experienced increased production compared to the first quarter of 2019. The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent market reactions late into the first quarter of 2020 resulted in an unexpected shift in demand from foodservice to retail markets, triggering a shift in supply and demand, causing volatility in market prices. The industry adjusted through reductions of egg sets and chick placements, which continued to trend throughout the year ended December 27, 2020, resulting in reduced broiler production in the last half of 2020. Reduced broiler production coincided with robust retail demand, quickly recovering foodservice throughout the second half of 2020, which had\nsignificantly improved over the low point during the second quarter of 2020. As a result, chicken market prices stabilized moving into the third quarter, and even improved in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year.\nWhile chicken prices have improved in the second half of 2020, prices in 2021 will depend on the recovery of the foodservice industry, influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, government regulation, uncertainty surrounding the general economy and protein supply.\nHometown Strong Initiative\nThe Hometown Strong initiative was developed in order to help the communities in which we operate respond to the unexpected challenges on society, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the Hometown Strong initiative will provide consequential investment projects for a lasting impact on these communities and help them prepare for unanticipated challenges and build for the future. For 2020, we committed to Hometown Strong donations of $20.0 million and during the year ended December 27, 2020, we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donations expense relating to this initiative.\nPotential Impact of Tariffs\nWe continue to monitor recent trade and tariff activity and its potential impact to exports and inputs costs across our reportable segments. Currently, we are experiencing impacts to domestic and export prices of chicken resulting from uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs. With the implementation of the EU-U.K Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there is uncertainty regarding the processing of imports and administration costs that will follow. This could lead to potential new tariffs and regulations from both the European Union and the U.K. We are unable to give any assurance as to the scope, duration, or impact of any changes in trade policies or tariffs, how successful any mitigation efforts will be, or the extent to which mitigation will be necessary, and accordingly, changes in trade policies and increased tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nReportable Segments\nWe operate in three reportable segments: the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, and Mexico. We measure segment profit as operating income. Corporate expenses are allocated to Mexico and U.K. and Europe reportable segments based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the U.S. For additional information, see Note 19. Reportable Segments\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\nResults of Operations\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNet sales. Net sales for 2020 increased $682.7 million, or 6.0%, from $11.4 billion generated in 2019 to $12.1 billion generated in 2020. The following table provides additional information regarding net sales:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percent data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,496,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,699) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. and Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>3,274,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>890,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico </td> <td> </td> <td>1,321,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67,118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,091,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>682,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Reportable Segment. U.S. net sales generated in 2020 decreased $140.7 million, or 1.8%, from U.S. net sales generated in 2019 primarily because of a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $188.2 million, or 2.4 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales. This decrease in net sales per pound was partially offset by $47.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, due to an increase in sales volume.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2020 increased $890.5 million, or 37.4%, from U.K. and Europe sales generated in 2019, primarily because of the recently acquired PPL operations, partially offset by a decrease in net sales by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. The impact of the acquired business contributed $1.1 billion, or 44.3 percentage points, to the increase in net sales. The decrease in our existing U.K. and Europe operations was driven by a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in net sales per pound, contributing $159.6 million, or 6.7 percentage points, and $14.5 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively, to the decrease in net sales. These decreases in sales volume and net sales\nper pound were partially offset by $8.0 million, or 0.4 percentage points, due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Mexico sales generated in 2020 decreased $67.1 million, or 4.8%, from Mexico sales generated in 2019 primarily because of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by an increase in net sales per pound. The impact of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased sales volume contributed $154.9 million, or 11.1 percentage points, and $22.1 million, or 1.6 percentage points, to the decrease in net sales.

Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2020 increased $92.3 million, or 1.3%, from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2019. Cost of sales increased primarily because of increased cost per pound sold and increased poultry sales volume of $49.3 million, or 0.7 percentage points, and $43.0 million, or 0.6 percentage points, respectively. Included in the increase in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a $43.4 million increase in live input costs, a $34.6 million increase in benefits costs mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an $18.0 million increase in depreciation costs, a $16.9 million increase in payroll costs due to higher pay rates, a $15.8 million increase in outside service costs from increased outside processing labor and a $15.6 million increase in insurance costs, mainly from higher workers' compensation costs. Partially offsetting these increases in cost per pound sold and increased sales volume was a decrease in derivative expense of $59.9 million resulting from higher realized losses on commodity derivatives in 2019. Other factors affecting U.S. cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $843.9 million, or 38.2%, from cost of sales incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of costs incurred by the acquired PPL operations, partially offset by decreases in cost of sales incurred by our existing U.K. and Europe operations. Cost of sales incurred by the acquired PPL operations contributed $1.0 billion, or 45.9 percentage points, to the increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales related to the existing U.K. and Europe operations decreased $169.7 million, or 7.7 percentage points, due to a decrease in poultry sales volume and a decrease in cost per pound sold of $147.1 million and\n$29.9 million, respectively. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by the $7.3 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decrease in cost per pound sold is due to the adjusted product mix from foodservice to retail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. Cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 decreased $21.0 million, or 1.7%, from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of the favorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement and decreased poultry sales volume of $141.0 million, or 11.5 percentage points, and $19.4 million, or 1.6 percentage points, respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases in cost of sales was an increase of $139.4 million, or 11.4 percentage points in cost per pound sold. Included in the decreased poultry sales volume and increased cost per pound sold was a $73.7 million increase in poultry input costs due to increased grain and ingredient costs. Other factors affecting cost of sales were individually immaterial.\nOperating income. Operating income decreased $445.1 million, or 64.5%, from $690.6 million generated for 2019 to $245.5 million generated for 2020.

Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2020 increased $184.8 million, or 75.0%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.S. operations during 2019 primarily from the $110.5 million DOJ agreement, the $75.0 million Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class settlement, $15.0 million in incremental donations expense related to the Hometown Strong initiative and a $25.6 million increase in professional fees mainly due to increased legal representation services. These increases in SG&A expense were partially offset by a $20.0 million decrease in payroll and benefit costs due to decreased incentive and stock-based compensation. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nU.K. and Europe Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2020 increased $22.9 million, or 24.7%, from SG&A expense incurred by the U.K. and Europe operations during 2019 primarily because of expenses incurred by the acquired PPL operations of $25.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense incurred from our existing U.K. and Europe operations of $2.8 million. The decrease in SG&A expense in our existing U.K. and Europe was mainly due to a $2.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $2.0 million decrease in legal and other professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nMexico Reportable Segment. SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2020 increased $5.0 million, or 12.2%, from SG&A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2019 primarily because of a $2.4 million increase in employee relations expenses and a $1.5 million increase in professional fees expense. Other factors affecting SG&A expense were individually immaterial.\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense decreased 4.9% to $126.1 million in 2020 from $132.6 million in 2019, primarily because of a decrease in weighted average interest rates to 4.7% in 2020 from 5.3% in 2019. As a percent of net sales, interest expense in 2020 and 2019 was 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively.\nIncome taxes. Our consolidated income tax expense in 2020 was $66.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $161.0 million in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense in 2020 resulted from a decrease in pre-tax income during 2020.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet sales.
