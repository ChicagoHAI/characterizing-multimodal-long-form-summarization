Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read this MD&A together with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and the accompanying notes. This MD&A does not discuss 2019 performance or a comparison of 2019 versus 2020 performance for select areas where we have determined the omitted information is not necessary to understand our current-period financial condition, changes in our financial condition, or our results. The omitted information may be found in our 2020 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021, in MD&A sections titled Consolidated Results of Operations,\u201d Single-Family Business,\u201d Multifamily Business,\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Management.\u201d\nKey Market Economic Indicators\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelow we discuss how varying macroeconomic conditions can influence our financial results across different business and economic environments. Our forecasts and expectations are subject to many uncertainties, including the pace and nature of economic growth, and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations. For example, home price growth could be adversely affected if growth in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) is weaker than we currently expect, if unemployment, particularly among existing homeowners and potential new home buyers, is higher than we expect, or if the housing market is more sensitive to economic and labor-market weaknesses than we expect. For further discussion on housing activity, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Market\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Market.\u201d\nSelected Benchmark Interest Rates\n(1)Refers to the U.S. weekly average fixed-rate mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey\u00ae. These rates are reported using the latest available data for a given period.\n(2)According to Bloomberg.\n(3)Refers to the daily rate per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. SOFR began in April 2018.\nHow Interest Rates Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Net interest income. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly. We amortize various cost basis adjustments over the life of the mortgage loan, including those relating to loan-level price adjustments we receive as upfront fees at the time we acquire single-family loans. As a result, any\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>58\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators </td> </tr>\n</table>\nprepayment of a loan results in an accelerated realization of those upfront fees as income. Therefore, as loan prepayments slow, the accelerated realization of amortization income also slows. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in the opposite trend of higher net amortization income from cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and related debt.\n\u2022Fair value gains (losses). We have exposure to fair value gains and losses resulting from changes in interest rates, primarily through our mortgage commitment derivatives and risk management derivatives, which we mark to market through earnings. Fair value gains and losses on our mortgage commitment derivatives fluctuate depending on how interest rates and prices move between the time a commitment is opened and when it settles. The net position and composition across the yield curve of our risk management derivatives changes over time. As a result, interest rate changes (increases or decreases) and yield curve changes (parallel, steepening or flattening shifts) will generate varying amounts of fair value gains or losses in a given period.\n\u2022Credit-related income (expense). Increases in mortgage interest rates tend to lengthen the expected lives of our loans, which generally increases the expected impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans. Decreases in mortgage interest rates tend to shorten the expected lives of our loans, which reduces the impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans.\n\u2022In January 2021, we began applying fair value hedge accounting to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, or the interest-rate effect, on our financial results. For additional information on how hedge accounting supports our interest-rate risk management strategy and our fair value hedge accounting policy, see Consolidated Results of Operations-Hedge Accounting Impact,\u201d Risk Management-Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management-Earnings Exposure to Interest-Rate Risk\u201d and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nSingle-Family Annual Home Price Growth Rate(1)\n(1) Calculated internally using property data on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae's home price index is a weighted repeat transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae's home price index excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. Fannie Mae's home price estimates are based on preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data becomes available.\nHow Home Prices Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Actual and forecasted home prices impact our provision or benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Changes in home prices affect the amount of equity that borrowers have in their homes. Borrowers with less equity typically have higher delinquency and default rates.\n\u2022As home prices increase, the severity of losses we incur on defaulted loans that we hold or guarantee decreases because the amount we can recover from the properties securing the loans increases. Declines in home prices increase the losses we incur on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Home prices also impact the growth and size of our guaranty book of business. As home prices rise, the principal balance of loans associated with purchase money mortgages may increase, which affects the size of our book. Additionally, rising home prices can increase the amount of equity borrowers have in their home, which may lead to an increase in origination volumes for cash-out refinance loans with higher principal\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>59\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators </td> </tr>\n</table>\nbalances than the existing loan. Replacing existing loans with newly acquired cash-out refinances can affect the growth and size of our book.\n\u2022Home price growth in 2021 was 19.0% on a national basis, the highest annual home price growth rate in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index, driven by continued low interest rates and low levels of housing supply relative to the level of demand. Cumulative home price growth for the two-year period ended December 31, 2021 was 31.4%, also the highest in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index. This record home price growth has been a key driver in the growth of our guaranty book of business over that period.\n\u2022The pace of rapid home price growth that we have experienced over the last year is not expected to continue. We expect home price growth to moderate to an annual growth rate of 8.2% in 2022, with slower growth expected thereafter driven by interest-rate increases, inflation and reduced affordability, especially for low- and moderate-income borrowers. As home price growth slows, we expect the amount of positive benefit, if any, to our credit-related income (expense) to moderate as well. Inflation and reduced affordability may present challenges as we pursue our mission to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality affordable rental housing.\nNew Housing Starts(1)\n(1)According to U.S. Census Bureau and subject to revision.\nHow Housing Activity Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Two key aspects of economic activity that can impact supply and demand for housing and thus mortgage lending are the rates of household formation and housing construction.\n\u2022Household formation is a key driver of demand for both single-family and multifamily housing. A newly formed household will either rent or purchase a home. Thus, changes in the pace of household formation can affect prices and credit performance as well as the degree of loss on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Growth of household formation stimulates homebuilding. Homebuilding has typically been a cyclical leader, weakening prior to a slowdown in U.S. economic activity and accelerating prior to a recovery, which contributes to the growth of GDP and employment. However, the housing sector's performance may vary from its historical precedent due to the many uncertainties surrounding future economic or housing policy as well as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages on the economy, and the housing market.\n\u2022With regard to housing construction, a decline in housing starts results in fewer new homes being available for purchase and potentially a lower volume of mortgage originations. Construction activity can also affect credit\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>60\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators </td> </tr>\n</table>\nlosses through its impact on home prices. If the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply, prices will appreciate and impact the risk profile of newly originated home purchase mortgages, depending on where in the housing cycle the market is. A reduced pace of construction is often associated with a broader economic slowdown and may signal expected increases in delinquency and losses on defaulted loans.\n\u2022We expect a continued lack of inventory for both new and existing homes will likely continue to constrain sales into 2022. However, due to the current strength in housing demand and low supply of homes for sale, we expect single-family housing starts to be higher in 2022 than in 2021, though the pace of new construction continues to be affected by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Despite the constraints on home sales and new construction, we continue to expect housing activity to remain solid into 2022.\nGDP, Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption\n(1)Real GDP growth (decline) and personal consumption growth (decline) are based on the quarterly series calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and are subject to revision.\n(2)According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and subject to revision.\nHow GDP, the Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Changes in GDP, the unemployment rate and personal consumption can affect several mortgage market factors, including the demand for both single-family and multifamily housing and the level of loan delinquencies, which in turn can lead to credit losses.\n\u2022Economic growth is a key factor for the performance of mortgage-related assets. In a growing economy, employment and income are rising, thus allowing existing borrowers to meet payment requirements, existing homeowners to consider purchasing and moving to another home, and renters to consider becoming homeowners. Homebuilding typically increases to meet the rise in demand. Mortgage delinquencies typically fall in an expanding economy, thereby decreasing credit losses.\n\u2022In a slowing economy, employment and income growth slow and housing activity slows as an early indicator of reduced economic activity. Typically, as an economic slowdown intensifies, households reduce their spending. This reduction in consumption then accelerates the slowdown. An economic slowdown can lead to employment losses, impairing the ability of borrowers and renters to meet mortgage and rental payments, thus causing loan\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>61\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators </td> </tr>\n</table>\ndelinquencies to rise. Home sales and mortgage originations also typically fall in a slowing economy.\n\u2022The economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued its momentum through 2021, with GDP pushing above its pre-pandemic level by mid-2021 as consumer spending and travel rebounded. The pace and strength of economic expansion remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the continuance of supply chain disruptions and related inflationary pressures, recovery of economic activity outside the U.S., current labor market shortages, the impact of the emergence of new, more infectious variants of the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccination rates.\nSee Risk

Specifically, we have exposure to earnings volatility that is driven by changes in interest rates in two primary areas: our net portfolio and our consolidated MBS trusts. The exposure in the\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nnet portfolio is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of risk management derivatives, mortgage commitments, and certain assets, primarily securities, that are carried at fair value. The exposure related to our consolidated MBS trusts relates to changes in our credit loss reserves and to the amortization of cost basis adjustments resulting from changes in interest rates.\nTo help address volatility in earnings attributable to interest-rate fluctuations in our net portfolio, we began applying fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 to reduce the current-period impact on our earnings related to changes in interest rates, particularly LIBOR and SOFR. Hedge accounting aligns the timing of when we recognize fair value changes in hedged items attributable to these benchmark interest-rate movements with fair value changes in the hedging instrument.\nUnder our hedge accounting program, we establish fair value hedging relationships between risk management derivatives, specifically interest-rate swaps, and qualifying portfolios of mortgage loans or funding debt. For hedging relationships that are highly effective, we recognize changes in the fair value of the hedged mortgage loans or funding debt attributable to movements in the benchmark interest rate in net interest income. We then offset that impact with the changes in fair value of the designated interest-rate swap. This has the effect of deferring the recognition of gains and losses on the hedging instrument to future periods by recognizing the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item as a cost basis adjustment on the underlying loans or funding debt at the end of the hedge term. The cost basis adjustment is then subsequently amortized back into earnings. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we deferred $1.5 billion in net fair value losses on our hedged loans and funding debt as cost basis adjustments that will be amortized through Net interest income\u201d over the contractual life of the respective hedged items.\nThe impact on Net interest income\u201d and Fair value gains (losses), net\u201d of the application of hedge accounting is presented below in the Net Interest Income\u201d section in the Components of Net Interest Income\u201d table and the Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d section in the Impact of Hedge Accounting on Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d table.\nAlthough hedge accounting reduces earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements in any given period, it does not impact the amount of interest-rate-driven gains or losses we will ultimately recognize through earnings.\nWhile we expect the earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements to continue to be reduced as a result of our adoption of hedge accounting, earnings variability driven by other factors, such as spreads or changes in cost basis amortization recognized in Net interest income,\u201d remains. In addition, our ability to effectively reduce earnings volatility is dependent on having the right mix and volume of interest-rate swaps available. As our portfolio of interest-rate swaps varies over time, our ability to reduce earnings volatility through hedge accounting may vary as well.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional discussion of our fair value hedge accounting policy and related disclosures.\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of net interest income is guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties.\nGuaranty fees consist of two primary components:\n\u2022base guaranty fees that we receive over the life of the loan; and\n\u2022upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level price adjustments and other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized into net interest income as cost basis adjustments over the contractual life of the loan. We refer to this as amortization income.\nWe recognize almost all of our guaranty fee revenue in net interest income because we consolidate the substantial majority of loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets. Guaranty fees from these loans account for the difference between the interest income on loans in consolidated trusts and the interest expense on the debt of consolidated trusts.\nThe timing of when we recognize amortization income can vary based on a number of factors, the most significant of which is a change in mortgage interest rates. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly, which typically results in lower net amortization income. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in higher net amortization income.\nWe also recognize net interest income on the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and our other investments portfolio (collectively, our portfolios\u201d) and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets. See Retained Mortgage Portfolio\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Other Investments Portfolio\u201d for more information about our portfolios.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>63\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince January 2021, we have recognized fair value changes attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates for mortgage loans and funding debt, and for related interest-rate swaps in hedging relationships, as a component of net interest income, including the amortization of hedge-related basis adjustments on mortgage loans or funding debt and any related interest accrual on the swaps.

See Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional information on the effect of our fair value hedge accounting program and related disclosures.\nNet interest income increased in 2021 compared with 2020 and in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by higher base guaranty fee income and higher net amortization income, partially offset by lower income from portfolios.\n\u2022Higher base guaranty fee income. An increase in the size of our single-family and multifamily guaranty book of business combined with higher average base guaranty fees on loans that now comprise a larger portion of our book contributed to the increases in base guaranty fee income in 2021 and 2020.\nFor single-family, higher base guaranty fee income was primarily due to the increase in the size of our guaranty book of business, driven by record home price appreciation in 2020 and 2021 having led to higher average loan balances. In addition, our average charged fees increased as a result of better pricing in the low-interest rate environment.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>64\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor multifamily, higher base guaranty fee income in 2021 compared with 2020 was similarly the result of an increase in our multifamily guaranty book of business combined with an increase in average charged guaranty fees. In addition, we realized higher multifamily yield maintenance revenue related to the prepayment of multifamily loans in 2021 compared with 2020.\n\u2022Higher net amortization income. Throughout all of 2021 and much of 2020 we were in a low interest rate environment, which led to significant prepayment volumes as loans refinanced, resulting in nearly two-thirds of our single-family book of business being originated since the beginning of 2020. As loans refinance, we accelerate the amortization of cost basis adjustments on the mortgage loans and any related debt of consolidated trusts, resulting in elevated amortization income for the periods.\nAmortization income was greater in 2021 than in 2020 primarily because the loans that prepaid in 2021, and the related debt of consolidated trusts that liquidated, had a greater amount of net unamortized deferred income associated with them. Generally, the loans that prepaid in 2021 had been outstanding for less time than those that prepaid in 2020, and a greater portion of loans that prepaid in 2021 were issued in a low-interest-rate environment, which resulted in a greater amount of net deferred income associated with them.\n\u2022Lower income from portfolios. Lower income from portfolios in 2021 was primarily due to the reduced average balance and lower yields on our retained mortgage portfolio, combined with lower yields on assets in our other investments portfolio as a result of the low interest rate environment. This reduction in income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our funding debt due to a decrease in average borrowing costs, primarily as a result of lower average interest rates on our long-term debt.\nThe decrease in the average balance of our retained mortgage portfolio for 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in our lender liquidity portfolio, which was driven by lower acquisitions through our whole loan conduit in the second half of 2021 as mortgage refinance activity slowed. In addition, sales of reperforming and nonperforming mortgage loans drove a decrease in our loss mitigation portfolio. See Retained Mortgage Portfolio\u201d for additional information about our lender liquidity and loss mitigation portfolios.\nNearly two-thirds of our single-family guaranty book of business has been originated since the beginning of 2020, as borrowers took advantage of the historically low rate environment. However, refinancing activity began to taper, particularly in the second half of 2021. We expect refinancing activity to be significantly lower in 2022 compared to 2021 levels as fewer borrowers may benefit from refinancing. Slower turnover in our book of business will likely result in lower amortization income as the average life of our outstanding book of business may extend. In addition, a slower turnover rate would limit the impact that changes in our guaranty fees have on our future revenues because any changes would take longer to meaningfully impact the average charged guaranty fee on our total book of business.\nFor loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to recognize interest for up to six months of delinquency provided that the loans were either current at March 1, 2020 or originated after March 1, 2020. We continue to accrue interest income beyond six months of delinquency provided that the collection of principal and interest continues to be reasonably assured. This resulted in a large portion of delinquent loans, including those in a forbearance arrangement, remaining on accrual status as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

initially recognize mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The difference between the initial fair value and the carrying value of these instruments is recorded as a cost basis adjustment, either as a premium or a discount, in our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize these cost basis adjustments over the contractual lives of the loans or debt. On a net basis, for mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts, we are in a premium position with respect to debt of consolidated trusts, which represents deferred income we will recognize in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as amortization income in future periods. The amount of our deferred income decreased in 2021 primarily as a result of refinance activity, which resulted in our recognition of a portion of deferred amortization income during 2021.\nDeferred Amortization Income Represented by Net Premium Position\non Debt of Consolidated Trusts\n(Dollars in billions)\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>67\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Gains, Net\nInvestment gains, net primarily includes gains and losses recognized from the sale of available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) securities, sale of loans, gains and losses recognized on the consolidation and deconsolidation of securities, and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on held for sale ( HFS\u201d) loans. The increase in net investment gains in 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily driven by a significant increase in the volume of sales of single-family HFS loans. Investment gains, net decreased during 2020 compared with 2019 primarily driven by a significant decrease in the volume of sales of single-family HFS loans due to the economic impact of the pandemic, which resulted in a suspension of loan sales for a period of time in 2020.\nFair Value Gains (Losses), Net\nThe estimated fair value of our derivatives, trading securities and other financial instruments carried at fair value may fluctuate substantially from period to period because of changes in interest rates, the yield curve, mortgage and credit spreads and implied volatility, as well as activity related to these financial instruments. While the estimated fair value of our derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risk exposures may fluctuate, some of the financial instruments that generate these exposures are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe table below displays the components of our fair value gains and losses.

Under hedge accounting, fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in certain benchmark interest rates, such as LIBOR or SOFR, for hedged mortgage loans or funding debt may be offset by fair value gains and losses on derivatives that are paired in hedging relationships and recognized in Net interest income.\u201d\nWhile our hedge accounting program is designed to address the volatility of our financial results associated with changes in fair value due to interest rates, it does not affect fair value gains and losses driven by other factors, such as credit spreads.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>68\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the amount of contractual interest accruals and fair value losses related to designated interest-rate swaps in qualifying hedging relationships that are recognized in Net interest income\u201d rather than Fair value gains (losses), net\u201d as a result of hedge accounting.

We supplement our issuance of debt securities with derivative instruments to further reduce duration risk, which includes prepayment risk. We purchase option-based risk management derivatives to economically hedge prepayment risk. In cases where options obtained through callable debt issuances are not needed for risk management derivative purposes, we may sell options in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) derivatives market in order to offset the options obtained in the callable debt. Our principal purpose in using derivatives is to manage our aggregate interest-rate risk profile within prescribed risk parameters. We generally use only derivatives that are relatively liquid and straightforward to value. We consider the cost of derivatives used in our management of interest-rate risk to be an inherent part of the cost of funding and hedging our mortgage investments and economically similar to the interest expense that we recognize on the debt we issue to fund our mortgage investments.\nWe present, by derivative instrument type, the fair value gains and losses on our derivatives in Note 8, Derivative Instruments.\u201d\nThe primary factors that may affect the fair value of our risk management derivatives include the following:\n\u2022Changes in interest rates. Our primary derivative instruments are interest-rate swaps, including pay-fixed and receive-fixed interest-rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps decrease in value and receive-fixed swaps increase in value as swap rates decrease (with the opposite being true when swap rates increase). Because the composition of our pay-fixed and receive-fixed derivatives varies across the yield curve, different yield curve changes (that is, parallel, steepening or flattening) will generate different gains and losses. Changes in the fair value of derivatives in hedging relationships are recorded in Net interest income.\u201d\n\u2022Changes in our derivative activity. The mix and balance of our derivative portfolio changes from period to period as we enter into or terminate derivative instruments to respond to changes in interest rates and changes in the balances and modeled characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the composition of our derivative portfolio affect the derivative fair value gains and losses we recognize in a given period.\nAdditional factors that affect the fair value of our risk management derivatives include implied interest-rate volatility and the time value of purchased or sold options.\nWe recognized fair value gains on risk management derivatives in 2021, largely the result of fair value hedge accounting treatment offsetting losses on interest-rate swaps. These losses were driven by decreases in the fair value of receive-fixed swaps resulting from increased swap rates during 2021. Accrued contractual interest income on interest-rate swaps also contributed to the fair value gains.\nWe recognized fair value losses on risk management derivatives in 2020 primarily as a result of net interest expense on interest-rate swaps and a decrease in the fair value of our interest-rate swaps due to losses on pay-fixed interest-rate swaps resulting from decreased swap rates during 2020.\nFor additional information on our use of derivatives to manage interest-rate risk, see Risk Management-Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management-Interest-Rate Risk Management.\u201d\nMortgage Commitment Derivatives Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\nWe account for certain commitments to purchase or sell mortgage-related securities and to purchase single-family mortgage loans as derivatives. For open mortgage commitment derivatives, we include changes in their fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. When derivative purchase commitments settle, we include the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date in the cost basis of the loan or security we purchase.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>69\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen derivative commitments to sell securities settle, we include the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date in the cost basis of the security we sell. Purchases of securities issued by our consolidated MBS trusts are treated as extinguishments of debt; we recognize the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date as a component of debt extinguishment gains and losses in Other expenses, net.\u201d Sales of securities issued by our consolidated MBS trusts are treated as issuances of consolidated debt; we recognize the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date as a component of debt in the cost basis of the debt issued.\nWe recognized fair value gains on our mortgage commitments in 2021 primarily due to gains on commitments to sell mortgage-related securities driven by decreases in prices during the commitment periods as interest rates increased modestly during 2021. We recognized fair value losses on our mortgage commitments in 2020 primarily due to losses on commitments to sell mortgage-related securities driven by increases in prices during the commitment periods as interest rates declined more sharply during 2020.\nTrading Securities Gains, Net\nLosses on trading securities in 2021 were primarily driven by increases in interest rates, which resulted in losses on fixed-rate securities held in our other investments portfolio, while gains on trading securities in 2020 were primarily driven by declines in interest rates, which resulted in gains on fixed-rate securities held in portfolio.\nCAS Debt Fair Value Gains, Net\nCredit risk transfer transactions, including CAS debt issuances, transfer a portion of credit losses on a reference pool of mortgage loans to investors. CAS debt we issued prior to 2016, which transferred single-family credit risk, is reported at fair value as a component of Debt of Fannie Mae\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. CAS debt issued subsequent to 2016 is not accounted for in a manner that generates fair value gains and losses. We expect our exposure to fair value gains and losses on CAS debt to continue to decline as the outstanding balance of this debt declines.\nWe recognized fair value losses on CAS debt reported at fair value in 2021 primarily due to tightened spreads between CAS debt yields and LIBOR. We recognized fair value gains on CAS debt reported at fair value in 2020 primarily due to widened spreads between CAS debt yields and LIBOR.\nFor further discussion of our single-family credit risk transfer transactions, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions.\u201d\nOther, Net\nWe elect the fair value option for our long-term debt of consolidated trusts that contain embedded derivatives that would otherwise require bifurcation. The fair value of our long-term consolidated trust debt held at fair value is reported as Debt of consolidated trusts\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in the fair value of our long-term consolidated trust debt held at fair value are included in Other, net\u201d in the table above.\nWe recognized fair value gains on our long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value in 2021 due to increases in interest rates and we recognized fair value losses on our long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value in 2020 due to declines in interest rates.\nCredit-Related Income (Expense)\nOur credit-related income or expense can vary substantially from period to period based on a number of factors, such as changes in actual and forecasted home prices or property valuations, fluctuations in actual and forecasted interest rates, borrower payment behavior, events such as natural disasters or pandemics, the types, volume and effectiveness of our loss mitigation activities, including forbearances and loan modifications, the volume of foreclosures completed and the redesignation of loans from held for investment ( HFI\u201d) to HFS.\nOur credit-related income or expense and our related loss reserves can also be impacted by updates to the models, assumptions and data used in determining our allowance for loan losses. As described below, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, our credit-related income or expense and our loss reserves have been significantly affected by our estimates of the impact of the pandemic and the pace and strength of the economy's subsequent recovery, which require significant management judgment. Although we believe the estimates underlying our allowance are reasonable, we may observe future volatility in these estimates as we continue to observe actual loan performance data and update our models and assumptions relating to this unprecedented event. See Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d for additional information about how our estimate of credit losses is subject to uncertainty.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>70\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBenefit (Provision) for Credit Losses\nThe table below provides a quantitative analysis of the drivers of our single-family and multifamily benefit or provision for credit losses and the change in expected credit enhancement recoveries. The benefit or provision for credit losses includes our benefit or provision for loan losses, accrued interest receivable losses and our guaranty loss reserves, and excludes credit losses on our AFS securities. It also excludes the transition impact of adopting the CECL standard, which was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.

In 2021, actual home price growth was at record levels. We expect home price growth to moderate in 2022, with slower growth expected thereafter. Higher home prices decrease the likelihood that loans will default and reduce the amount of credit loss on loans that do default, which impacts our estimate of losses and ultimately reduces our loss reserves and provision for credit losses. See Key Market Economic Indicators\u201d for additional information about how home prices affect our credit loss estimates, including a discussion of home price appreciation and our home price forecast. Also see Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d for more information about our home price forecast.\n\u2022Benefit from the redesignation of certain nonperforming and reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS. We redesignated certain nonperforming and reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS, as we no longer intend to hold them for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Upon redesignation of these loans, we recorded the loans at the lower of cost or fair value with a write-off against the allowance for loan losses. Amounts recorded in the allowance related to these loans exceeded the amounts written off, resulting in a net benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Benefit from changes in assumptions regarding COVID-19 forbearance and loan delinquencies. During the first half of 2021, management used its judgment to supplement the loss projections developed by our credit loss model to account for uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that was not represented in historical data or otherwise captured by our credit model. For the second half of 2021, management removed the remaining non-modeled adjustment as the effects of the government's economic stimulus, the vaccine rollout, and the effectiveness of COVID-19-related loss mitigation strategies were much less uncertain. Specifically, the decrease in uncertainty as of December 31, 2021 compared with the end of 2020 was primarily driven by the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the broad implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program in the United States, which contributed to a significant increase in business activity and helped support continued economic growth. There has also been a steady decline in the number of borrowers in a COVID-19-related forbearance, lessening expectations of credit losses. Additionally, we believe the array of possible future economic environments included in our credit model, which captures scenarios that may be remote, combined with data consumed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as forbearance outcomes, have removed the need to continue to supplement modeled results.\nThe impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of the following factor, which reduced our single-family benefit for credit losses recognized in 2021:\n\u2022Provision for higher actual and projected interest rates. Actual and projected interest rates were higher as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020. As mortgage rates increase, we expect a decrease in future prepayments on single-family loans, including modified loans. Lower expected prepayments extend the expected lives of modified loans, which increases the expected impairment relating to term and interest-rate concessions provided on these loans, resulting in a provision for credit losses.\nThe primary factors that contributed to our single-family provision for credit losses in 2020 were:\n\u2022Provision from changes in actual and expected loan delinquencies and change in assumptions regarding COVID-19 forbearance, which included adjustments to modeled results. The economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant driver of credit-related expenses during 2020, with the majority of the impact recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Estimating expected credit losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required significant management judgment regarding a number of matters, including our expectations surrounding the length of time that loans would remain in forbearance and the type and extent of loss mitigation that might be needed when loans exit a COVID-19-related forbearance, political uncertainty and the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future course of the pandemic, including new strains of the virus and its effect on the economy. As a result, we believed the model used to estimate single-family credit losses did not capture the entirety of losses we expected to incur relating to COVID-19 at that time. Accordingly, management used its judgment to significantly increase the loss projections developed by our credit loss model in the first quarter of 2020. The model consumed data from the initial quarters of the pandemic, including loan delinquencies, and updated credit profile data for loans in forbearance. As more of this data was consumed by our credit loss model throughout the year, we reduced the non-modeled adjustment initially recorded in the first quarter of 2020.\nManagement continued to apply its judgment and supplement model results as of December 31, 2020, taking into account the continued high degree of uncertainty regarding the future impact of the pandemic and its effect on the economy at that time.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>72\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of the following factors, which reduced our single-family provision for credit losses recognized in 2020:\n\u2022Benefit from actual and expected home price growth. In the first quarter of 2020, we significantly reduced our expectations for home price growth to near-zero for 2020. However, the negative impact from the first quarter of 2020 was more than offset by a robust increase in actual home price growth through the remainder of 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we also expected more moderate home price growth for 2021.\n\u2022Benefit from lower actual and projected interest rates. For much of 2020, we continued to be in a historically low interest rate environment, which we expected to continue in 2021. We expected continuing low interest-rates would result in a continuing high level of prepayments on single-family loans, including modified loans. Higher expected prepayments shorten the expected lives of modified loans, which decreases the expected impairment relating to term and interest-rate concessions provided on these loans and results in a benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Benefit from the redesignation of certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS. In the third quarter of 2020, we resumed sales of reperforming loans after our suspension of new loan sales in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we redesignated certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS in the second half of 2020, as we no longer intended to hold them for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Upon redesignation of these loans, we recorded the loans at the lower of cost or fair value with a write-off against the allowance for loan losses. Amounts recorded in the allowance related to these loans exceeded the amounts written off, resulting in a benefit as shown in the table above.\nMultifamily Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses\nThe primary factors that contributed to our multifamily benefit for credit losses in 2021 were:\n\u2022Benefit from actual and projected economic data. In 2021, property value forecasts increased due to continued demand for multifamily housing. In addition, improved job growth led to an increase in projected average property net operating income, which reduced the probability of loan defaults, resulting in a benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Benefit from lower expected credit losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to our single-family benefit for credit losses described above, for the first half of 2021 management used its judgment to supplement the loss projections developed by our credit loss model to account for uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of 2021, management removed the remaining non-modeled adjustment as the effects of the economic stimulus, the vaccine rollout, and the effectiveness of COVID-19-related loss mitigation strategies were much less uncertain. See Single-Family Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses,\u201d above for more information on these factors.\nOur multifamily provision for credit losses in 2020 was primarily driven by:\n\u2022Provision from actual and projected economic data and estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included adjustments to modeled results. Our multifamily provision for credit losses in 2020 was driven by higher expected losses as a result of the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened economic uncertainty, driven by elevated unemployment, which we expected would result in a decrease in multifamily property net operating income and property values. In addition, the multifamily provision for credit losses included increased expected credit losses on seniors housing loans, as these properties were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Consistent with the single-family discussion above, we believed the model we used to estimate multifamily credit losses did not capture the entirety of losses we expected to incur relating to COVID-19 at that time. Accordingly, management used its judgment to increase the loss projections developed by our credit loss model. The model consumed data from the initial quarters of the pandemic, but we continued to apply management judgment and supplement model results as of December 31, 2020, taking into account the continued high degree of uncertainty that remained related to the impact of the pandemic.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>73\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below provides quantitative analysis of the drivers in 2019 of our single-family benefit for credit losses.

This enhancement was performed as a part of management's routine model performance review process. In addition to incorporating recent loan performance data, this model enhancement better captures recent prepayment activity, default rates, and loss severity in the event of default. The enhancement resulted in a decrease in our allowance for loan losses and an incremental benefit for credit losses of approximately $850 million and is included in Other\u201d in the table above.\n\u2022An increase in actual and forecasted home prices.\n\u2022Changes in loan activity. Higher loan liquidation activity generally occurs during a lower interest-rate environment as loans prepay, and during the peak home buying season of the second and third quarters of each year. When mortgage loans prepay, we reverse any remaining allowance related to these loans, which contributed to the benefit for credit losses.\nTCCA Fees\nPursuant to the TCCA, in 2012 FHFA directed us to increase our single-family guaranty fees by 10 basis points and remit this increase to Treasury. This TCCA-related revenue is included in Net interest income\u201d and the expense is recognized as TCCA fees\u201d in our consolidated financial statements.\nTCCA fees increased in 2021 compared with 2020 as our book of business subject to the TCCA continued to grow during the year. FHFA has provided guidance that we are not required to accrue or remit TCCA fees to Treasury with respect to loans backing MBS trusts that have been delinquent for four months or longer. Once payments on such loans resume, we will resume accrual and remittance to Treasury of the associated TCCA fees on the loans. See Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE-Focused Matters-Guaranty Fees and Pricing\u201d for further discussion of the TCCA.\nCredit Enhancement Expense\nCredit enhancement expense consists of costs associated with our freestanding credit enhancements, which primarily include our CAS and CIRT programs, EPMI, and amortization expense for certain lender risk-sharing programs. For our CAS and CIRT programs, this expense is generally based on the average balance of the covered reference pool. Therefore, the periodic expense at the transaction or security level generally increases or decreases as the covered balance increases or decreases. We exclude from this expense costs related to our CAS transactions accounted for as debt instruments and credit risk transfer programs accounted for as derivative instruments. Credit enhancement expense has been presented as a separate line item for all periods presented. Prior to 2020, credit enhancement\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>74\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nexpenses were recorded in Other expenses, net.\u201d We discuss the transfer of mortgage credit risk in Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.\u201d\nChange in Expected Credit Enhancement Recoveries\nChange in expected credit enhancement recoveries consists of the change in benefits recognized from our freestanding credit enhancements, including any realized amounts. Benefits, if any, from our CAS, CIRT and EPMI programs previously recorded in Fee and other income\u201d have been reclassified to Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries\u201d for all periods presented. Benefits from other lender risk-sharing programs, including our multifamily DUS program, were recorded as a reduction of credit-related expense in periods prior to 2020. However, with our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, benefits from freestanding credit enhancements are no longer recorded as a reduction of credit-related expenses. These benefits from lender risk-sharing have been reclassified into Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries\u201d on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe recognized provisions for federal income taxes of $5.8 billion in 2021, $3.1 billion in 2020 and $3.4 billion in 2019. Our provision for federal income taxes increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily because of the increase in our pre-tax income. Similarly, our provision for federal income taxes decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 because of the decrease in our pre-tax income. In addition, we recognized a benefit for federal income taxes in 2019 of $205 million as a result of a favorable resolution with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) of an uncertain tax position.\nOur effective tax rates were 20.7% in 2021, 20.7% in 2020 and 19.4% in 2019. Our effective tax rates for each of these periods was also impacted by the benefits of our investments in housing projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits. See Note 9, Income Taxes\u201d for additional information on our income taxes.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

equivalents from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in prepayments due to lower refinance volumes for loans of consolidated trusts, resulting in lower cash balances held in trust at period-end. For information on our accounting policy for restricted cash and cash equivalents, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nInvestments in Securities\nInvestments in securities decreased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a decrease in funding debt issuances during the period. With lower funding debt issuances, our other investments portfolio decreased as maturing investments in securities were not replaced. For details on the maturity and weighted-average yield of our AFS securities, please see Note 5, Investments in Securities-Maturity Information.\nFor further discussion, see Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management.\u201d\nMortgage Loans, Net of Allowance\nThe mortgage loans reported in our consolidated balance sheets are classified as either HFS or HFI and include loans owned by Fannie Mae and loans held in consolidated trusts.\nMortgage loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 driven by an increase in mortgage loans due to acquisitions, primarily from continued high refinancing activity, outpacing liquidations and sales.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>76\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information on our mortgage loans, see Note 3, Mortgage Loans,\u201d and for additional information on changes in our allowance for loan losses, see Note 4, Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nOther Assets\nThe decrease in other assets from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in receivables from servicers, as loan delinquencies have declined, and a decrease in advances to lenders driven by lower loan acquisition volumes through the whole loan conduit. For information on our accounting policy for advances to lenders, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nDebt\nDebt of consolidated trusts represents the amount of Fannie Mae MBS issued from consolidated trusts and held by third-party certificateholders. Debt of Fannie Mae is the primary means of funding our mortgage purchases. Debt of Fannie Mae also includes CAS debt, which we issued in connection with our transfer of mortgage credit risk.\nThe decrease in debt of Fannie Mae from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to decreased funding needs. The increase in debt of consolidated trusts from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by sales of Fannie Mae MBS, which are accounted for as issuances of debt of consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets, since the MBS certificate ownership is transferred from us to a third party. See Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding\u201d for a summary of activity in debt of Fannie Mae and a comparison of the mix between our outstanding short-term and long-term debt. Also see Note 7, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information on our total outstanding debt.\nStockholders' Equity\nOur net equity increased as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020 by the amount of our comprehensive income recognized during 2021.\nThe aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased from $142.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $163.7 billion as of December 31, 2021.

In addition, sales of reperforming and nonperforming mortgage loans drove a decrease in our loss mitigation portfolio.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>78\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Retained Mortgage Portfolio </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the components of our retained mortgage portfolio, measured by unpaid principal balance.

We are currently managing our business to a $225 billion cap pursuant to instructions from FHFA.\nWe include 10% of the notional value of interest-only securities in calculating the size of the retained portfolio for the purpose of determining compliance with the senior preferred stock purchase agreement retained portfolio limits and associated FHFA guidance. As of December 31, 2021, 10% of the notional value of our interest-only securities was $2.0 billion, which is not included in the table above.\nUnder the terms of our MBS trust documents, we have the option or, in some instances, the obligation, to purchase mortgage loans that meet specific criteria from an MBS trust. The purchase price for these loans is the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus accrued interest. If a delinquent loan remains in a single-family MBS trust, the servicer is responsible for advancing the borrower's missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS holders for up to four months, after which time we must make these missed payments. In addition, we must reimburse servicers for advanced principal and interest payments. The cost of purchasing most delinquent loans from a single-family Fannie Mae MBS trust and holding them in our retained mortgage portfolio is currently less than the cost of advancing delinquent payments to security holders.\nExcept for loans that are in forbearance or that have been granted certain other types of loss mitigation options (such as a repayment plan or payment deferral), we have historically purchased loans from single-family MBS trusts when they become four consecutive monthly payments delinquent. In September 2020, FHFA instructed both us and Freddie Mac to extend the timeframe for our single-family delinquent loan buyout policy to 24 consecutively missed monthly\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>79\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Retained Mortgage Portfolio </td> </tr>\n</table>\npayments (that is, loans that are 24 months past due) effective January 1, 2021. Despite this change in policy, we currently anticipate that in most cases we will purchase delinquent loans from single-family MBS trusts prior to the 24-month deadline under one of the exceptions to the general policy, which include loans that are permanently modified, loans subject to a short-sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, loans that are paid in full and loans referred to foreclosure.\nIn support of our loss mitigation strategies, we purchased $10.4 billion of loans from our single-family MBS trusts during 2021, the substantial majority of which were delinquent, compared with $13.5 billion of loans purchased from single-family MBS trusts during 2020. We expect the amount of loans we buy out of trusts will increase in 2022 as loans exiting COVID-19-related forbearance will lead to an increase in the number of delinquencies and loan modifications. The size of our retained mortgage portfolio will be impacted by the volume of loans we ultimately buy, the timing of those purchases, and the length of time those loans remain in our retained mortgage portfolio. These factors are highly uncertain and depend on a number of factors, including the length of time loans remain in forbearance, the extent and duration of foreclosure suspensions, future loan sales and the nature and success of our loss mitigation activities, including payment deferrals and repayment plans, which do not require us to purchase loans out of trust.

When we resecuritize Freddie Mac securities into Fannie Mae-issued structured securities, such as Supers and REMICs, our guaranty of principal and interest extends to the underlying Freddie Mac securities. However, Freddie Mac continues to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized. We do not charge an incremental guaranty fee to include Freddie Mac securities in the structured securities that we issue. References to our single-family guaranty book of business exclude Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized.\nOur issuance of structured securities backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities creates additional off-balance sheet exposure. Our guaranty extends to the underlying Freddie Mac security included in the structured security, but we do not have control over the Freddie Mac mortgage loan securitizations. Because we do not have the power to direct matters (primarily the servicing of mortgage loans) that impact the credit risk to which we are exposed, which constitute control of these securitization trusts, we do not consolidate these trusts in our consolidated balance sheet, giving rise to off-balance sheet exposure. We expect our off-balance sheet exposure to Freddie Mac securities to increase as we issue more structured securities backed by Freddie Mac securities in the future. See Note 6, Financial Guarantees\u201d for more information regarding our maximum exposure to loss on unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac securities.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>80\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Guaranty Book of Business </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the composition of our guaranty book of business based on unpaid principal balance.

We also securitize or purchase loans insured by FHA, loans guaranteed by the VA, loans guaranteed by the Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, manufactured housing mortgage loans and other mortgage-related securities.\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>82\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSingle-Family Mortgage Servicing\nOur single-family mortgage loans are serviced by mortgage servicers on our behalf. Some loans are serviced by the lenders that initially sold the loans to us. In other cases, loans are serviced by third-party servicers that did not originate or sell the loans to us. For loans we own or guarantee, the lender or servicer must obtain our approval before selling servicing rights to another servicer.\nOur mortgage servicers typically collect and deliver principal and interest payments, administer escrow accounts, monitor and report on loan performance, perform default prevention activities, evaluate transfers of ownership interests, respond to requests for partial releases of security, and handle proceeds from casualty and condemnation losses. Our mortgage servicers are the primary point of contact for borrowers and perform a key role in the effective implementation of our servicing policies, negotiation of workouts for delinquent and troubled loans, and other loss mitigation activities. If necessary, mortgage servicers inspect and preserve properties and process foreclosures and bankruptcies. For information on the risks of our reliance on servicers, refer to Risk Factors-Credit Risk.\u201d\nWe compensate servicers primarily by permitting them to retain a specified portion of each interest payment on a serviced mortgage loan as a servicing fee. Servicers also generally retain assumption fees, late payment charges and other similar charges, to the extent they are collected from borrowers, as additional servicing compensation. We also compensate servicers for negotiating workouts on problem loans.\nOur servicers are required to develop, follow and maintain written procedures relating to loan servicing and legal compliance in accordance with our Servicing Guide. We oversee servicer compliance with our Servicing Guide requirements and execution of our loss mitigation programs by conducting reviews of select servicers. These reviews are designed to test a servicer's quality control processes and compliance with our requirements across key servicing functions. Issues identified through these Servicing Guide compliance reviews are provided to the servicer with prescribed corrective actions and expected resolution due dates, and we monitor servicers' remediation of their compliance issues.\nWe employ a servicer performance management program, called the STAR Program, which provides our largest servicers a transparent framework of key metrics and operational assessments to recognize strong performance and identify areas of weakness. Additionally, performance management staff measure, monitor and manage overall servicer performance by providing loss mitigation workout projections to targeted servicers, discussing performance against projections and tracking action items to improve.\nRepercussions for poor performance by a servicer may include performance improvement plans, lost incentive income, compensatory fees, monetary and non-monetary remedies, and reduced opportunity for STAR Program recognition. If poor performance persists, servicing may ultimately be transferred to a different servicer.\nSingle-Family Credit Risk and Credit Loss Management\nOur Single-Family business:\n\u2022Prices and manages the credit risk on loans in our single-family guaranty book of business through our loan acquisition policies.\n\u2022Works to reduce costs of defaulted single-family loans through home retention solutions and foreclosure alternatives, management of foreclosures and our REO inventory, selling nonperforming loans, and pursuing contractual remedies from lenders, servicers and providers of credit enhancements.\n\u2022Enters into transactions that transfer a portion of the credit risk on some of the loans in our single-family guaranty book of business through our credit risk transfer programs.\nSee Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management\u201d below for discussion of our strategies for managing credit risk and credit losses on single-family loans.\nSingle-Family Lenders and Investors\nIn support of our mission to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality affordable rental housing across America, we work with lenders that operate within the primary mortgage market where mortgage loans are originated and funds are loaned to borrowers. Our lenders include mortgage banking companies, savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, credit unions, community banks, private mortgage originators, insurance companies, and state and local housing finance agencies. Lenders originating mortgages in the primary mortgage market often sell them in the secondary mortgage market in the form of whole loans or in the form of mortgage-related securities.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>83\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2021, approximately 1,200 lenders delivered single-family mortgage loans to us. We acquire a significant portion of our single-family mortgage loans from several large mortgage lenders. During 2021 and 2020, our top five lenders, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 31% of our single-family business volume. Rocket Companies, Inc., was the only lender that accounted for 10% or more of our single-family business volume in 2021, representing approximately 13%.\nWe have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of single-family Fannie Mae MBS include asset managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, Treasury, central banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. Our CAS investors include asset managers, real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and insurance companies, while our CIRT transaction counterparties are insurers and reinsurers.\nSingle-Family Competition\nWe compete to acquire single-family mortgage assets in the secondary market. We also compete for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities to investors. Competition in these areas is affected by many factors, including the number of residential mortgage loans offered for sale in the secondary market by loan originators and other market participants, the nature of the residential mortgage loans offered for sale (for example, whether the loans represent refinancings), the current demand for mortgage assets from mortgage investors, the interest-rate risk investors are willing to assume and the yields they will require as a result, and the credit risk and prices associated with available mortgage investments.\nCompetition to acquire mortgage assets is significantly affected by both our and our competitors' pricing and eligibility standards, as well as investor demand for UMBS and for our and our competitors' other mortgage-related securities. Our competitive environment also may be affected by many other factors, including our risk appetite and capital requirements; new or existing legislation or regulations applicable to us, our lenders or our investors; and digital innovation and disruption in our markets. In competing to acquire loans in the secondary market, we focus on understanding what drives our lenders' execution decisions and identifying how to best deliver value while supporting our mission. See Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform,\u201d Business-Legislation and Regulation,\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for information on matters that could affect our business and competitive environment.\nOur competitors for the acquisition of single-family mortgage assets are financial institutions and government agencies that manage residential mortgage credit risk or invest in residential mortgage loans, including Freddie Mac, FHA, the VA, Ginnie Mae (which primarily guarantees securities backed by FHA-insured loans and VA-guaranteed loans), the FHLBs, U.S. banks and thrifts, securities dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, investment funds and other mortgage investors. Currently, our primary competitors for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities are Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and private market competitors. Competition for investors and counterparties in our credit risk transfer transactions comes primarily from other issuers of mortgage credit risk transactions, such as Freddie Mac and private mortgage insurers. We also compete for investor funds against other credit-related securitized products, such as private-label residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS\u201d), commercial RMBS, and collateralized loan obligations. As noted above, the nature of our primary competitors and the overall levels of competition we face could change as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>84\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Market </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSingle-Family Mortgage Market\nIn the charts below we present macroeconomic factors that affect the single-family mortgage market in which our Single-Family business operates.

Our acquisition share estimate is based on publicly available data regarding the amount of single-family first-lien mortgage loans originated and our competitors' acquisitions. We exclude our purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts in the calculation of our estimated share.\n2021 Single-Family Mortgage Acquisition Share\nIn addition, the table below shows our estimated share of mortgage acquisitions over a longer time horizon from 2000 through 2021. Our share of total mortgage acquisitions has fluctuated over time and is often impacted by economic cycles. For example, during periods of recession, our acquisition share has historically increased as some other market competitors reduced their acquisitions.\nFannie Mae Single-Family Acquisition Share of Total Market Originations1\n(1) Acquisition share is calculated as the ratio of Fannie Mae single-family acquisitions over our estimate of total market originations. We exclude our purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts in the calculation of our acquisition share. Acquisition share is subject to change as additional data become available.

The significant increase in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019 was driven by very high volumes of refinance activity due to historically low mortgage rates. Based on the latest data available, the chart below displays our estimated share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances in 2021 as compared with that of our primary competitors.\nWe estimate our share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances was 41% in 2020 and 37% 2019.\nPresentation of Our Single-Family Guaranty Book of Business\nFor purposes of the information reported in this Single-Family Business\u201d section, we measure the single-family guaranty book of business using the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. By contrast, the single-family guaranty book of business presented in the Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business\u201d table in the Guaranty Book of Business\u201d section is based on the unpaid principal balance of the Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, rather than the unpaid principal balance of the underlying mortgage loans. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been remitted to the MBS holders or instances where we have advanced missed borrower payments on mortgage loans to make required distributions to related MBS holders. As measured for purposes of the information reported below, our single-family conventional guaranty book of business was $3,483.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, $3,200.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $2,951.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nSingle-Family Business Metrics\nNet interest income for our Single-Family business is driven by the guaranty fees we charge and the size of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. Our business volume and growth in our guaranty book of business is affected by the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding, the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market and our share of mortgage acquisitions. The guaranty fees we charge are based on the characteristics of the loans we acquire. We may adjust our guaranty fees in light of market conditions and to achieve return targets. As a result, the average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions may fluctuate based on the credit quality and product mix of loans acquired, as well as market conditions and other factors.\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>87\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Business Metrics </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe charts below display our average charged guaranty fees, net of TCCA fees, on our single-family conventional guaranty book of business and on new single-family conventional loan acquisitions, along with our average single-family conventional guaranty book of business and our single-family conventional loan acquisitions for the periods presented.\nSelect Single-Family Business Metrics\n(Dollars in billions)\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average charged guaranty fee on single-family conventional guaranty book of business, net of TCCA fees(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average single-family conventional guaranty book of business(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average charged guaranty fee on new single-family conventional acquisitions, net of TCCA fees(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Single-family conventional acquisitions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes the impact of a 10 basis point guaranty fee increase implemented pursuant to the TCCA, the incremental revenue from which is remitted to Treasury and not retained by us.\n(2) Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business primarily consists of single-family conventional mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. It also includes single-family conventional mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on single-family conventional mortgage assets. Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business does not include: (a) mortgage loans guaranteed or insured, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government; or (b) Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac-issued UMBS that we have resecuritized. Our average single-family conventional guaranty book of business is based on quarter-end balances.\nAverage charged guaranty fee on newly acquired conventional single-family loans is a metric management uses to measure the price we earn as compensation for the credit risk we manage and to assess our return. Average charged guaranty fee represents, on an annualized basis, the average of the base guaranty fees charged during the period for our single-family conventional guaranty arrangements, which we receive monthly over the life of the loan, plus the recognition of any upfront cash payments, including loan-level price adjustments, based on an estimated average life at the time of acquisition. We use loan-level price adjustments, including various upfront risk-based fees, to price for the credit risk we assume in providing our guaranty. FHFA must approve changes to the national loan-level price adjustments we charge and can direct us to make other changes to our single-family guaranty fee pricing.\nOur average charged guaranty fee on newly acquired conventional single-family loans, net of TCCA fees, increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the impact of the adverse market refinance fee, which was in effect from December 2020 through July 2021. See Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring\u201d for further information on the credit risk profile of our acquisitions in 2021 compared with 2020 and 2019.\nIn January 2022, FHFA announced targeted increases to the upfront fees we charge for certain high-balance loans and second home loans. High-balance loans are mortgages originated in certain designated areas above the baseline conforming loan limit. The new fees are effective for loans purchased on or after April 1, 2022, and for loans delivered into an MBS trust with an issue date on or after April 1, 2022. High-balance loans will continue to be eligible for our\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>88\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Business Metrics </td> </tr>\n</table>\nexisting affordable loan products, Home Ready\u00ae and HFA PreferredTM, which offer caps on loan-level price adjustments for eligible borrowers.

While we perform various quality assurance checks by sampling loans to assess compliance with our underwriting and eligibility criteria, we do not independently verify all reported information and we rely on lender representations and warranties regarding the accuracy of the characteristics of loans in our guaranty book of business. See Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risk that we could experience mortgage fraud as a result of this reliance on lender representations and warranties. We provide information on non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities held in our portfolio in Note 5, Investments in Securities.\u201d\nSingle-Family Acquisition and Servicing Policies and Underwriting and Servicing Standards\nOverview\nOur Single-Family business, with the oversight of our Enterprise Risk Management division, is responsible for setting underwriting and servicing standards and pricing, and managing credit risk relating to our single-family guaranty book of business.\nUnderwriting and Servicing Standards\nThe Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide ( Selling Guide\u201d) sets forth our underwriting and eligibility guidelines, as well as our policies and procedures related to selling single-family mortgages to us. Our Servicing Guide sets forth our policies for servicing the loans in our single-family guaranty book.\nDesktop Underwriter\nOur proprietary automated underwriting system, Desktop Underwriter\u00ae ( DU\u00ae\u201d), is used by mortgage lenders to evaluate the substantial majority of our single-family loan acquisitions. DU measures credit risk by assessing the primary risk factors of a mortgage and provides a comprehensive risk assessment of a borrower's loan application and eligibility of the loan for sale to us. Risk factors evaluated by DU include the key loan attributes described under Single-Family Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring\u201d below. DU applies our own assessment of the borrower's credit data, including using trended credit data when available. DU analyzes the results of this risk and eligibility evaluation to arrive at the underwriting recommendation for the loan case file. As part of our comprehensive risk management approach, we periodically update DU to reflect changes to our underwriting and eligibility guidelines. As part of normal business operations, we regularly review DU to determine whether its risk analysis and eligibility assessment are appropriate based on the current market environment and loan performance information. We also regularly review DU's underlying risk assessment models and recalibrate these models to improve DU's ability to effectively analyze risk and avoid excessive risk layering. Factors we take into account in these evaluations include the profile of loans delivered to us, loan performance and current market conditions.\nConsistent with this risk management approach, in September 2021, we enhanced DU to include the following updates, among others:\n\u2022To help increase homeownership opportunities, we enhanced DU's eligibility assessment to consider a borrower's positive rental payment history in the credit risk assessment.\n\u2022Loans underwritten through DU generally are subject to a minimum 620 credit score requirement. In 2021, to support homeownership opportunities for more underserved borrowers, we updated DU so that, when assessing whether a loan meets this requirement, DU now uses the average of all borrowers' median credit scores, instead of the lowest median credit score.\nWe expect these changes will result in an increase in loans eligible for acquisition through DU. We will continue to closely monitor loan acquisitions and market conditions and, as appropriate, make changes to ensure that the loans we acquire are consistent with our risk appetite and mission.\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>91\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Underwriting Standards\nDU was used to evaluate over 90% of the single-family loans we acquired in 2021. However, we also purchase and securitize mortgage loans that have been underwritten using other automated underwriting systems, as well as manually underwritten mortgage loans that meet our stated underwriting requirements or meet agreed-upon standards that differ from our standard underwriting and eligibility criteria. The majority of loans we acquired in 2021 that were not underwritten with DU were underwritten through a third-party automated underwriting system, such as Freddie Mac's Loan Product Advisor\u00ae.\nCOVID-19 Selling Policies\nBased on improved current market conditions, we are no longer offering most of the COVID-19-related temporary flexibilities to our Selling Guide as of December 31, 2021, that we had previously offered.\nWe continue to maintain the following temporary selling policy updates, which provide clarity and mitigate risk:\n\u2022requiring additional due diligence regarding the payment status of a borrower's existing mortgage loans;\n\u2022providing clarity for assessing self-employment income for qualifying purposes; and\n\u2022requiring that loans be no more than six months old to be eligible for sale to us.\nIn October 2021, FHFA announced that desktop appraisals would be incorporated into our Selling Guide for certain purchase loans beginning in early 2022 to sustainably advance the affordability of homeownership for mortgage borrowers. We previously offered a desktop appraisal option as a temporary flexibility, from March 2020 through May 2021.\nServicing Policies\nOur servicing policies establish the requirements our servicers must follow in:\n\u2022processing and remitting loan payments;\n\u2022working with delinquent borrowers on loss mitigation activities;\n\u2022managing and protecting Fannie Mae's interest in the pledged property; and\n\u2022processing bankruptcies and foreclosures.\nOur goal is to ensure that our policies support management of risk over the life of the mortgage loan by enabling default prevention activities, promoting loss mitigation in the event of default and providing for the preservation and protection of the collateral supporting the mortgage loan. See Single-Family Primary Business Activities-Single-Family Mortgage Servicing\u201d above for more information on the servicing of our single-family mortgage loans.\nCOVID-19 Servicing Policies\nWe worked with Freddie Mac in March 2020, as instructed by FHFA, to implement temporary policies to assist borrowers impacted by COVID-19, and we have subsequently amended some of these requirements. We continue to monitor the market and work with Freddie Mac as instructed by FHFA to amend or implement temporary policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to enable our single-family loan servicers to better assist borrowers impacted by COVID-19.\nThese temporary policies include:\n\u2022authorizing servicers to offer up to 12 months of forbearance, upon the request of any single-family borrower experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the borrower's delinquency status; for loans already in a COVID-19-related forbearance as of February 28, 2021, servicers may grant an extension of forbearance for up to an additional six months, to a total of up to 18 months, provided that the forbearance does not result in the loan becoming greater than 18 months delinquent;\n\u2022offering a payment deferral workout option to eligible borrowers who have resolved a COVID-19-related financial hardship but cannot afford to bring the loan current by reinstating the loan (that is, repaying all the missed payments at one time) or through a repayment plan (that is, repaying the missed payments over time). The payment deferral workout option allows the borrower to defer up to 18 months of past-due payments, without interest, to the end of the loan term (or when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term). All other terms of the loan remain unchanged;\n\u2022adjusting the terms for a Flex Modification for eligible COVID-19-impacted borrowers to provide an opportunity to reduce the interest rate regardless of the mortgage loan's post-modification mark-to-market loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio; and\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>92\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe temporarily suspended foreclosures and certain foreclosure-related activities for single-family properties through July 31, 2021, other than for vacant or abandoned properties. In addition, in June 2021, the CFPB issued a final rule prohibiting certain new single-family foreclosures on mortgage loans secured by the borrower's principal residence until after December 31, 2021. Both of these suspensions had expired as of December 31, 2021.\nQuality Control Process\nOur quality control process includes using automated tools to help us determine whether a loan meets our underwriting and eligibility guidelines, performing in-depth reviews, and selecting random samples of performing loans for quality control review shortly after delivery.\nRepurchase Requests and Representation and Warranty Framework\nIf we determine that a mortgage loan did not meet our underwriting or eligibility requirements, loan representations or warranties were violated, or a mortgage insurer rescinded coverage, then, except as described below, our mortgage sellers and/or servicers are obligated to either repurchase the loan or foreclosed property, reimburse us for our losses or provide other remedies. We refer to our demands that mortgage sellers and servicers meet these obligations collectively as repurchase requests.\nUnder our representation and warranty framework, lenders can obtain relief from repurchase liability for violations of certain underwriting representations and warranties. Loans with 36 months of consecutive monthly payments and minimal delinquencies over a specified time period or with satisfactory conclusion of a full-file quality control review are eligible for relief. However, no relief may be granted for violations of life of loan\u201d representations and warranties, such as those relating to whether a loan was originated in compliance with applicable laws or conforms to our charter requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of the outstanding loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business that were acquired and are subject to this framework have obtained relief based solely on payment history or the satisfactory conclusion of a full-file quality control review, and an additional 63% remain eligible for relief in the future.\nIn addition, lenders may obtain relief from liability for violations of a more narrow set of representations and warranties through the use of specified underwriting tools. This primarily includes relief for:\n\u2022borrower income, asset and employment data that has been validated through DU; and\n\u2022appraised property value for appraisals that have received a qualifying risk score in Collateral Underwriter\u00ae, our appraisal review tool.\nSingle-Family Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring\nOverview\nThe composition of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business is diversified by product type, loan characteristics and geography, all of which influence credit quality and performance and may reduce our credit risk. We monitor various loan attributes, in conjunction with housing market and economic conditions, to determine if our pricing, eligibility and underwriting criteria accurately reflect the risk associated with loans we acquire. In some cases, we may decide to significantly reduce our participation in riskier loan product categories. We also review the payment performance of loans in order to help identify potential problem loans early in the delinquency cycle and to guide the development of our loss mitigation strategies.\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>93\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe profile of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business includes the following key risk characteristics:\n\u2022LTV ratio. LTV ratio is a strong predictor of credit performance. The likelihood of default and the severity of a loss in the event of default are typically lower as LTV ratio decreases. This also applies to estimated mark-to-market LTV ratios, particularly those over 100%, as this indicates that the borrower's mortgage balance exceeds the property value.\n\u2022Product type. Certain loan product types have features that may result in increased risk. Generally, intermediate-term, fixed-rate mortgages exhibit the lowest default rates, followed by long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Historically, adjustable-rate mortgages ( ARMs\u201d), including negative-amortizing and interest-only loans, and balloon/reset mortgages have exhibited higher default rates than fixed-rate mortgages, partly because the borrower's payments rose, within limits, as interest rates changed.\n\u2022Number of units. Mortgages on one-unit properties tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on two-, three- or four-unit properties.\n\u2022Property type. Certain property types have a higher risk of default. For example, condominiums generally are considered to have higher credit risk than single-family detached properties.\n\u2022Occupancy type. Mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as a primary or secondary residence tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on investment properties.\n\u2022Credit score. Credit score is a measure often used by the financial services industry, including us, to assess borrower credit quality and the likelihood that a borrower will repay future obligations as expected. A higher credit score typically indicates lower credit risk.\n\u2022Debt-to-income ratio. Debt-to-income ( DTI\u201d) ratio refers to the ratio of a borrower's outstanding debt obligations (including both mortgage debt and certain other long-term and significant short-term debts) to that borrower's reported or calculated monthly income, to the extent the income is used to qualify for the mortgage. As a borrower's DTI ratio increases, the associated risk of default on the loan generally increases, especially if other higher-risk factors are present. From time to time, we revise our guidelines for determining a borrower's DTI ratio. The amount of income reported by a borrower and used to qualify for a mortgage may not represent the borrower's total income; therefore, the DTI ratios we report may be higher than borrowers' actual DTI ratios.\n\u2022Loan purpose. Loan purpose refers to how the borrower intends to use the funds from a mortgage loan-either for a home purchase or refinancing of an existing mortgage. Cash-out refinancings have a higher risk of default than either mortgage loans used for the purchase of a property or other refinancings that restrict the amount of cash returned to the borrower.\n\u2022Geographic concentration. Local economic conditions affect borrowers' ability to repay loans and the value of collateral underlying loans. Geographic diversification reduces mortgage credit risk.\n\u2022Loan age. We monitor year of origination and loan age, which is defined as the number of years since origination. Credit losses on mortgage loans typically do not peak until the third through fifth year following origination; however, this range can vary based on many factors, including changes in macroeconomic conditions and foreclosure timelines.\nThe following table displays our single-family conventional business volumes and our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, based on certain key risk characteristics that we use to evaluate the risk profile and credit quality of our single-family loans. As shown in the table below, our single-family conventional guaranty book of business has been impacted by record home price appreciation in 2021. The weighted average mark-to-market LTV ratio decreased from 58% as of December 31, 2020 to 54% as of December 31, 2021, and the percentage of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business with a mark-to-market LTV ratio over 80% decreased from 13% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020, to 7% as of December 31, 2021.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>94\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide additional information on the credit characteristics of our single-family loans in quarterly financial supplements, which we furnish to the SEC with current reports on Form 8-K and make available on our website.

However, refinancing activity began to taper in the second half of 2021, as fewer borrowers could benefit from refinancing. Accordingly, the share of our single-family loan acquisitions consisting of refinance loans rather than home purchase loans modestly decreased in 2021 compared with 2020. The decline in refinance share led to a decline in the percentage of loans we acquired with a FICO credit score over 740, from 73% in 2020 to 69% in 2021. In addition, our acquisitions of loans from first-time home buyers increased from 13% of our single-family loan acquisitions in 2020 to 16% in 2021. We expect refinancing activity to be significantly lower in 2022 compared to 2021 levels as fewer borrowers may benefit from refinancing.\nOur share of acquisitions of loans with DTI ratios above 45% increased in 2021 compared with 2020. This increase was driven by the higher share of home purchase acquisitions, which tend to have higher DTI ratios than refinance loan acquisitions.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we implemented a new low-income refinance program, referred to as RefiNow\u2122, intended to increase refinancings by low-income borrowers by reducing their refinancing costs. In October 2021, we announced enhancements to help expand the reach of RefiNow to additional creditworthy homeowners, further enabling equitable and sustainable access to homeownership. To be eligible for the RefiNow program as enhanced, borrowers must meet specified criteria, including having:\n\u2022a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage secured by a 1-unit, principal residence;\n\u2022a current income at or below 100% of the area median income;\n\u2022not missed a mortgage payment in the past six months, and no more than one missed mortgage payment in the past 12 months, unless the missed payment was associated with a COVID-19-related forbearance and has been resolved; and\n\u2022a mortgage with an LTV ratio up to 97%, a DTI ratio of 65% or less, and a minimum FICO credit score of 620.\nThe credit profile of our future acquisitions will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022our future guaranty fee pricing and our competitors' pricing, and any impact of that pricing on the volume and mix of loans we acquire;\n\u2022our internal risk limits;\n\u2022our future eligibility standards and those of mortgage insurers, FHA and VA;\n\u2022the percentage of loan originations representing refinancings;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022our future objectives and activities in support of those objectives, including actions we may take to reach additional underserved creditworthy borrowers;\n\u2022government and regulatory policy;\n\u2022market and competitive conditions;\n\u2022the volume and characteristics of high LTV refinance loans we acquire in the future; and\n\u2022our future capital requirements.\nWe expect the ultimate performance of our loans will be affected by borrower behavior, public policy and macroeconomic trends, including unemployment, the economy and home prices. In addition, if lenders retain more of the higher-quality loans they originate, it could negatively affect the credit profile of our new single-family acquisitions.\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>97\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHigh-Balance Loans\nThe standard conforming loan limit for a one-unit property was $510,400 for 2020, $548,250 for 2021 and increased to $647,200 for 2022. As we discuss in Business-Our Mission, Strategy and Charter-Our Charter,\u201d we are permitted to acquire loans with higher balances in certain areas, which we refer to as high-balance loans.\nIn January 2022, FHFA announced targeted increases to the upfront fees we charge for certain high-balance loans and second home loans. See Single-Family Business-Single-Family Business Metrics\u201d for more information about the timing and application of these new fees.\nThe following table displays the amount of high-balance loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business.

The outstanding unpaid principal balance of reverse mortgage loans and Fannie Mae MBS backed by reverse mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business was $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $16.4 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nMortgage Products with Rate Resets\nARMs are mortgage loans with an interest rate that adjusts periodically over the life of the mortgage based on changes in a specified index. Rate-reset modifications are mortgage loans we have modified with terms that include a reduction in the borrowers' interest rate that is fixed for an initial period and is followed by one or more annual interest rate increases. The majority of these loans have fixed interest rates for an initial five-year period followed by annual interest rate increases, of up to 1 percent per year, until the mortgage rate reaches the prevailing market rate at the time of modification.\nThe outstanding unpaid principal balance of rate-reset modifications in our guaranty book of business was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. During 2021, approximately 85% of these modified loans experienced an interest rate reset to a weighted-average interest rate of 3.95%. For many of these loans, this was the final rate reset per the loan terms.\nThe table below displays the unpaid principal balance for ARMs and rate-reset modifications in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business by the year of their next scheduled contractual reset date. The contractual reset is either an adjustment to the loan's interest rate or a scheduled change to the loan's monthly payment to begin to reflect the payment of principal. The timing of the actual reset dates may differ from those presented due to a number of factors, including refinancing or exercising of other provisions within the terms of the mortgage.

We believe the current performance trend for these loans is the result of the historically low interest-rate environment. If interest rates rise significantly, it is uncertain that this trend will continue.\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>98\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSingle-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk\nOne of the key components of our credit risk management strategy is the transfer of mortgage credit risk to third parties.

We generally achieve this through primary mortgage insurance. Primary mortgage insurance transfers varying portions of the credit risk associated with a mortgage loan to a third-party insurer. For us to receive a payment in settlement of a claim under a primary mortgage insurance policy, the insured loan must be in default and the borrower's interest in the property securing the loan must have been extinguished, generally in a foreclosure action, short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Claims are generally paid three to six months after title to the property has been transferred. For a discussion of our policies that govern mortgage insurers' claim-paying obligations to us, see Risk Management-Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management.\u201d\nCredit Risk Transfer Transactions\nOur Single-Family business has developed other risk-sharing capabilities to transfer portions of our single-family mortgage credit risk to the private market. Our credit risk transfer transactions are designed to transfer a portion of the losses we expect would be incurred in an economic downturn or a stressed credit environment. Generally, benefits are received after the underlying property has been liquidated and all applicable proceeds, including private mortgage insurance benefits, have been applied to reduce the loss. We continually evaluate our credit risk transfer transactions which, in addition to managing our credit risk, also affect our returns on capital.\nIn October 2021, we resumed issuing new credit risk transfer transactions to transfer mortgage credit risk via both our CAS and CIRT programs. The October issuances were the first credit risk transfer transactions we have entered into since the first quarter of 2020. In 2021 we transferred a portion of the mortgage credit risk on single-family mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of $204.6 billion at the time of the transactions. In 2021 we also exercised early termination options to cancel certain CIRT transactions and completed a tender offer to repurchase some of our outstanding CAS debt. Our decision to reduce coverage under existing credit risk transfer transactions was based on a number of factors, including the ongoing premiums for the deals, their capital treatment, and our risk management objectives.\nAlthough we expect to engage in a higher volume of credit risk transfer transactions in 2022 compared to our 2021 issuances, the structure of and extent to which we issue or terminate any additional credit risk transfer transactions in the future may be affected by our capital requirements, the degree of regulatory capital relief provided by the transactions, our risk appetite, the strength of future market conditions, the cost of these transactions, FHFA's 2022 scorecard and guidance, and the review of our overall business and capital plan.\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>99\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCategories of Our Credit Risk Transfer Transactions Table 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Transaction Description </td> <td>Other Key Characteristics </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAS Debt </td> <td>\u2022 We transferred to investors a portion of the mortgage credit risk associated with losses on a reference pool of mortgage loans.\n\u2022 We created a reference pool consisting of recently acquired single-family mortgage loans included in our guaranty book of business and create a hypothetical securitization structure with notional credit risk positions, or tranches (that is, first loss, mezzanine and senior).\n\u2022 CAS debt was issued related to the first loss, mezzanine and senior loss risk positions.\n\u2022 We retained the senior loss and all or a portion of the first loss tranche in CAS transactions. In addition, we retained a pro rata share of risk equal to approximately 5% of all notes sold in mezzanine tranches.\n\u2022 CAS debt is recognized as debt of Fannie Mae\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. CAS debt issued to investors beginning January 2016 through October 2018 is recognized at amortized cost.

The outstanding unpaid principal balance for all loans covered by credit risk transfer programs, including all loans on which risk has been transferred in lender risk-sharing transactions, was $750 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n(8)Excludes $2.1 billion of legacy CAS issuances that were repurchased in November 2021.\nWhile these deals are expected to mitigate some of our potential future credit losses (generally net of any proceeds received from front-end credit enhancements, such as primary mortgage insurance), these deals are not designed to shield us from all losses. We retain a portion of the risk of future credit losses on loans covered by CAS and CIRT transactions, including a portion of the first loss positions and all of the senior loss positions. In addition, on our CAS transactions, we retain a pro rata share of risk equal to approximately 5% of all notes sold in mezzanine tranches. The risk in force of these transactions, which refers to the maximum amount of losses that could be absorbed by credit risk transfer investors, was approximately $35 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared with approximately $40 billion as of December 31, 2020. Because of the large number of mortgage prepayments in the past year, the first loss retention layer on our credit risk transfer transactions has increased as a percentage of the outstanding reference pool. As a result, losses on the remaining covered reference pools must generally reach a higher percentage of the remaining outstanding balance before those credit risk transfer transactions will pay any benefits to us. In addition, home price appreciation since we entered into the transactions has reduced the likelihood that we will incur losses on the covered loans large enough to receive a benefit from these transactions.\nWe have designed our credit risk transfer transactions so that the principal payment and loss performance of the transactions correspond to the performance of the loans in the underlying reference pools. Losses are applied in reverse sequential order starting with the first loss tranche. Principal repayments may be allocated to reduce the mezzanine amounts outstanding; however, these payments may be subject to certain lock-out periods and performance triggers in order to build additional credit protection for the senior tranches retained by us. For CAS transactions, all principal payments and losses assigned to the mezzanine tranches are allocated pro rata between the sold notes and the portion we retain, when performance is above a certain threshold.\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>102\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table displays the approximate cash paid or transferred to investors for these credit risk transfer transactions.

As a result, the percentage of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business without credit enhancement increased.\nSingle-Family Problem Loan Management\nOverview\nOur problem loan management strategies are focused primarily on reducing defaults to avoid losses that would otherwise occur and pursuing foreclosure alternatives to mitigate the severity of the losses we incur. If a borrower does not make required payments, or is in jeopardy of not making payments, we work with the loan servicer to offer workout solutions to minimize the likelihood of foreclosure as well as the severity of loss. When appropriate, we seek to move to foreclosure expeditiously.\nBelow we describe the following:\n\u2022delinquency statistics on our problem loans;\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>103\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022efforts undertaken to manage our problem loans, including the role of servicers in loss mitigation, forbearances, loan workouts, and sales of nonperforming loans;\n\u2022metrics regarding our loan workout activities;\n\u2022REO management; and\n\u2022other single-family credit-related information, including our credit loss performance and credit loss concentration metrics, loss reserves and TDRs resulting from loan modifications.\nWe also provide ongoing credit performance information on loans underlying single-family Fannie Mae MBS and loans covered by single-family credit risk transfer transactions. For loans backing Fannie Mae MBS, see the Forbearance and Delinquency Dashboard\u201d available in the MBS section of our Data Dynamics\u00ae tool, which is available at www.fanniemae.com/datadynamics. For loans covered by credit risk transfer transactions, see the Deal Performance Data\u201d report available in the CAS and CIRT sections of the tool. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. Information in Data Dynamics may differ from similar measures presented in our financial statements and other public disclosures for a variety of reasons, including as a result of variations in the loan population covered, timing differences in reporting and other factors.\nDelinquency\nThe tables below display the delinquency status of loans and changes in the volume of seriously delinquent loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business based on the number of loans. Single-family seriously delinquent loans are loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the foreclosure process, expressed as a percentage of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. Management monitors the single-family serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with single-family loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses.\nFor purposes of our disclosures regarding delinquency status, we report loans receiving COVID-19-related payment forbearance as delinquent according to the contractual terms of the loan. Pursuant to the CARES Act, for purposes of reporting to the credit bureaus, servicers must report a borrower receiving a COVID-19-related payment accommodation during the covered period, such as a forbearance plan or loan modification, as current if the borrower was current prior to receiving the accommodation and the borrower makes all required payments in accordance with the accommodation.

As of December 31, 2021, single-family loans in forbearance comprised 36% of our single-family seriously delinquent loans. The percentage of seriously delinquent loans that have been delinquent for more than 180 days increased as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020 primarily due to loans that continue to remain in a COVID-19-related forbearance and have become more delinquent.\nWe monitor the single-family serious delinquency rate excluding loans in forbearance to better understand the impact that forbearance activity has had on the overall rate. Our single-family serious delinquency rate excluding loans in forbearance increased to 0.81% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 0.66% as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to loans exiting forbearance and entering into trial modifications. We expect the majority of loans in trial modifications will successfully complete their trial modification periods (generally three to four months), which will reduce our single-family serious delinquency rate. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to result in a continued higher single-family serious delinquency rate over the next several quarters compared with pre-pandemic levels.\nFactors that affect our single-family serious delinquency rate include:\n\u2022the percentage of our loans that receive forbearance and the length of time they remain in forbearance;\n\u2022the pace and effectiveness of payment deferrals, loan modifications and other workouts;\n\u2022the timing and volume of nonperforming loan sales we execute;\n\u2022pandemics and natural disasters;\n\u2022servicer performance; and\n\u2022changes in home prices, unemployment levels and other macroeconomic conditions.\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>105\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the serious delinquency rates for, and the percentage of our seriously delinquent single-family conventional loans represented by, the specified loan categories.

Based on our expectations regarding the economic recovery, which we discuss in Key Market Economic Indicators,\u201d we believe that the substantial majority of borrowers who will ultimately request COVID-19-related relief have already done so.\nAs shown in the tables below, many of the loans that entered forbearance have since exited; therefore, the percentage of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business in forbearance as of December 31, 2021 has declined to 0.7%. Some borrowers whose loans are in forbearance continue to make payments according to the original contractual terms of the loan notwithstanding the forbearance arrangement; we expect some of these borrowers will continue to do so and therefore remain current. The table below provides information on the delinquency and accrual status of our single-family loans in forbearance. We expect many of the loans in forbearance will resolve their delinquency through a payment deferral or other form of loan workout. As discussed below, servicers are required to contact borrowers prior to the end of forbearance to evaluate them for loan workout options that can support their successful transition out of forbearance.\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>107\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to accrue interest income on a majority of our single-family loans in forbearance because we have determined that collection of principal and interest on these loans is reasonably assured.

Those options include:\n\u2022a reinstatement (where the borrower repays all of the missed payments at one time);\n\u2022a repayment plan (where the borrower repays the missed payments over time);\n\u2022a payment deferral (where the borrower defers the missed payments to the end of the loan term, or to when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term); or\n\u2022a modification of the loan terms so that the borrower may be brought current, which typically results in the borrower making reduced monthly contractual payments over a longer period of time.\nThe table below displays the status as of the current period-end of the single-family loans in our guaranty book of business that received a forbearance in 2020 or 2021. The vast majority of these forbearance arrangements were offered to borrowers who experienced a COVID-19-related financial hardship. Many of these borrowers have successfully resolved their forbearance arrangement, primarily through payment deferral or reinstatement. In addition, many of the loans that received a forbearance arrangement have subsequently liquidated, primarily as a result of refinancing, through 2021. By contrast, we expect that a higher percentage of loans that have yet to resolve their forbearance will receive a modification.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 93% of loans that received a forbearance and subsequently received a payment deferral were current, and 86% of loans that received a forbearance and subsequently received a completed modification were current.

We continue to accrue interest income beyond six months of delinquency provided that the collection of principal and interest continues to be reasonably assured. Our evaluation of whether the collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured considers the probability of default and the current value of the collateral. Once the forbearance period has ended, we will also consider the extent to which the borrower and the servicer have agreed to any of the loss mitigation options that are available. We then measure an allowance for expected credit losses on the unpaid accrued interest receivable balances such that the balance sheet reflects the net amount of interest we expect to collect. The application of our nonaccrual policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large portion of delinquent loans, including those in forbearance, remaining on accrual status. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in this report for additional information about our nonaccrual accounting policy.\nUnder our nonaccrual accounting policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our allowance for accrued interest receivable considers both the loan's principal and accrued interest receivable balances as well as any proceeds that are expected from contractually attached mortgage insurance when assessing collectability. Our assessment of collectability requires significant management judgment; as a result, our allowance for accrued interest receivable is subject to the same review processes, as well as other established governance and controls, used for our allowance for loan losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our accrued interest receivable on single-family loans that are in a forbearance plan was $445 million with a related allowance of $38 million. Of this allowance balance, approximately 76% was related to loans more than 180 days delinquent. As of December 31, 2020, our accrued interest receivable on single-family loans that were in a forbearance plan was $1.9 billion with a related allowance of $173 million. Of this balance, approximately 74% was related to loans more than 180 days delinquent. The decrease in our allowance for accrued interest receivable on single-family loans in forbearance as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily as a result of loans exiting forbearance as well as record home price appreciation in 2021 on the underlying collateral.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>110\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal and Interest Payments while Loans are in Forbearance\nWhile a loan is in forbearance and remains in an MBS trust, investors in the MBS are entitled to continue to receive principal and interest payments on the MBS even though the borrower is not required to make principal and interest payments. For the majority of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business, our Single-Family Servicing Guide used to require servicers to advance missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS trusts until the loans were purchased from the MBS trusts, including the portion of interest that represents guaranty fees owed to us. Because we typically do not purchase loans from MBS trusts while they are in forbearance, this servicer payment obligation could have continued for the entirety of the forbearance plan. In August 2020, at FHFA's instruction, we reduced our single-family servicers' obligations to advance these missed borrower payments and only require servicers to advance missed scheduled principal and interest payments on a loan for the first four months of missed borrower payments. After four months, we make the missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS trust for payment to MBS holders so long as the loan remains in the MBS trust. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we advanced $1.7 billion in missed borrower principal and interest payments to MBS trusts for payment to MBS holders, compared with $1.2 billion in missed borrower principal and interest payments for the year ended December 31, 2020. Since FHFA's instruction in August of 2020 through December 31, 2021, we have advanced $2.9 billion in missed borrower principal and interest payments. See Retained Mortgage Portfolio\u201d for a description of when we purchase loans from single-family MBS trusts.\nLoan Workout Metrics\nAs a part of our credit risk management efforts, loan workouts represent actions we take to help reinstate loans to current status and help homeowners stay in their home or to otherwise avoid foreclosure. Our loan workouts reflect various types of home retention solutions, including repayment plans, payment deferrals, and loan modifications. Our loan workouts also include foreclosure alternatives, such as short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nWe work with our servicers to implement our home retention solution and foreclosure alternative initiatives, and we emphasize the importance of early contact with borrowers and early entry into a home retention solution. We require that servicers first evaluate borrowers for eligibility under a workout option before considering foreclosure. The existence of a second lien may limit our ability to provide borrowers with loan workout options, particularly those that are part of our foreclosure prevention efforts; however, we are not required to contact a second lien holder to obtain their approval prior to providing a borrower with a loan modification.\nHome Retention Solutions\nWhen a borrower cannot bring the loan current by reinstating the loan or through a repayment plan, we use our payment deferral and loan modification workout options to help resolve the loan's delinquency. We developed a payment deferral workout option for borrowers impacted by COVID-19 that allows the borrower to defer up to 18 months of past-due payments, without interest, to the end of the loan term (or when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term). All other terms of the loan remain unchanged.\nCharacteristics of our loan modifications may include:\n\u2022changes to the original mortgage terms such as product type, interest rate, amortization term, maturity date and/or unpaid principal balance;\n\u2022collection of less than the contractual amount due under the original loan; or\n\u2022receiving the full amount due, or certain installments due, under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan.\nOur primary loan modification program is currently the Flex Modification program, which offers payment relief for eligible borrowers, targeting a 20% payment reduction.\nForeclosure Alternatives\nWe offer foreclosure alternatives for borrowers who are unable to retain their homes. Foreclosure alternatives may be more appropriate if the borrower has experienced a significant adverse change in financial condition due to events such as long-term unemployment or reduced income, divorce, or unexpected issues like medical bills, and is therefore no longer able to make the required mortgage payments. To avoid foreclosure and satisfy the first-lien mortgage obligation, our servicers work with a borrower to:\n\u2022accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, whereby the borrower voluntarily signs over the title to their property to the servicer; or\n\u2022sell the home prior to foreclosure in a short sale, whereby the borrower sells the home for less than the full amount owed to Fannie Mae under the mortgage loan.\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>111\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese alternatives are designed to reduce our credit losses while helping borrowers avoid having to go through a foreclosure. We work to obtain the highest price possible for the properties sold in short sales.\nIn the event there is a covered loss after the borrower defaults and title to the property is subsequently transferred through a foreclosure, short-sale, or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, we may be entitled to proceeds from primary mortgage insurance. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $127 million of mortgage insurance proceeds related to covered losses compared with $279 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $479 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information about how mortgage insurance claims are paid, as well as a description of our other credit enhancement programs, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk.\u201d For a discussion of our policies that govern mortgage insurers' claim-paying obligations to us, see Risk Management-Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management.\u201d\nThe chart below displays the unpaid principal balance of our completed single-family loan workouts by type, as well as the number of loan workouts. This table does not include loans in an active forbearance arrangement, trial modifications, loans to certain borrowers who have received bankruptcy relief that are classified as troubled debt restructurings, and repayment plans that have been initiated but not completed.\n(1)There were approximately 39,100 loans, 14,400 loans and 18,400 loans in a trial modification period that was not yet complete as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)Includes repayment plans and foreclosure alternatives. Repayment plans reflect only those plans associated with loans that were 60 days or more delinquent. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020, we exclude completed forbearance arrangements from the table. For year ended December 31, 2019, the table includes $105 million of completed forbearance arrangements that involve loans that were 90 days or more delinquent.\nThe increase in home retention solutions in 2021 and in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by completed COVID-19-related payment deferrals, which have been the primary loan workout solution for borrowers exiting COVID-19-related forbearance. The total amount of principal and interest deferred to the end of the loan term for single-family loans that received a payment deferral was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $2.4 billion was deferred interest. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the total amount of principal and interest deferred was $1.5 billion, of which $928 million was deferred interest.\nGiven the broad impact of the pandemic and the number of loans in forbearance, we expect loan workout activity to continue to remain elevated in 2022.\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>112\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the percentage of our single-family loan modifications completed during 2020 and 2019 that were current or paid off one year after modification and, for modifications completed during 2019, two years after modification.

This problem loan management strategy is intended to reduce: the number of seriously-delinquent loans, the severity of losses incurred on these loans, and the capital we would be required to hold for such loans. During 2021, we sold approximately 18,300 nonperforming loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.2 billion and approximately 94,400 reperforming loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $13.6 billion.\nREO Management\nIf a loan defaults, we may acquire the property through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

Net sales price includes borrower relocation incentive payments and subordinate lien(s) negotiated payoffs.\nWe market and sell the majority of our foreclosed properties through local real estate professionals. Our primary objectives for our REO inventory are to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership, quality affordable rental housing, and housing for owner occupant and community-minded purchasers, while obtaining the highest price possible. In some cases, we use alternative methods of disposition, including selling homes to municipalities, other public entities or non-profit organizations, and selling properties through public auctions. We also engage in third-party sales at foreclosure, which allow us to avoid maintenance and other REO expenses we would have incurred had we acquired the property.\nIn response to the pandemic and with instruction from FHFA, we prohibited our servicers from completing foreclosures on our single-family loans through July 31, 2021, except in the case of vacant or abandoned properties. In addition, as described in Single-Family Acquisition and Servicing Policies and Underwriting and Servicing Standards-COVID-19 Servicing Policies,\u201d our servicers were required to comply with a CFPB rule that prohibited certain new single-family foreclosures on mortgage loans secured by the borrower's principal residence until after December 31, 2021. As a result, foreclosure volumes were lower through 2021 and 2020 compared with pre-pandemic levels. We expect foreclosure volumes to gradually increase in 2022.\nAs shown in the chart below, the majority of our REO properties are unable to be marketed at any given time because the properties are occupied, under repair, or are subject to state or local redemption or confirmation periods, or eviction moratoriums, which delays the marketing and disposition of these properties.\nAlthough the total number of our REO properties decreased in 2021 and 2020 compared with pre-pandemic levels, the COVID-19-related eviction moratorium on single-family REOs led to a larger portion of properties being classified as \"unable to market,\u201d as the majority of these properties were occupied.\nOther Single-Family Credit Information\nSingle-Family Credit Loss Metrics and Loan Sale Performance\nThe single-family credit loss metrics and loan sale performance measures below present information about losses or gains we realized on our single-family loans during the periods presented. The amount of these losses or gains in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, post-foreclosure REO activity, mortgage loan redesignations, and other events that trigger write-offs and recoveries. The single-family credit loss metrics we present are not defined terms and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these measures to evaluate the effectiveness of our single-family credit risk management strategies in conjunction with leading indicators such as serious delinquency and forbearance rates, which are potential indicators of future realized single-family credit losses. We believe these measures provide useful information about our single-family credit performance and the factors that impact it.\nTable 300: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>114\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe revised the presentation of our single-family credit loss metrics in connection with our implementation of the CECL standard in January 2020, principally by separating the Charge-offs, net of recoveries\u201d line item into three line items: Write-offs,\u201d Recoveries,\u201d and Write-offs on the redesignation of mortgage loans from HFI to HFS.\u201d Because sales of nonperforming and reperforming loans have been an important part of our credit loss mitigation strategy in recent periods, we also provide information in the table below on our loan sale performance through the Gains on sales and other valuation adjustments\u201d line item.\nThe table below displays the components of our single-family credit loss metrics and loan sale performance.

This increase in loans sales was primarily due to our temporary suspension of new sales of reperforming and nonperforming loans for a portion of 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nWe expect a gradual increase in our single-family write offs in 2022 as a result of an increase in foreclosure activity, due in part to the expiration of the CFPB rule that prohibited certain new single-family foreclosures on mortgage loans secured by the borrower's principal residence until after December 31, 2021.

Under our nonaccrual policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, loans that have been placed in a repayment plan or brought current through a modification or a payment deferral are returned to accrual status once the borrower has made six consecutive contractual payments under the terms of the repayment plan or modified loan. For loans not subject to the COVID-19-related nonaccrual policy, we return a modified single-family loan to accrual status at the point when the borrower successfully makes all required payments during the trial period and the modification is made permanent. For additional information on our accounting policy for nonaccrual loans, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nSingle-Family Maturity Information\nThe below table shows the contractual maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our single-family loan portfolio. Although the loans in our portfolio have varying contractual terms (for example, 15-year, 30-year, etc.), the actual life of the loans is likely to be significantly less than their contractual term as a result of prepayment. Therefore, the contractual term is not a reliable indicator of the loans' expected lives. Single-family mortgages can be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty.\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-Family Loans: Maturities and Terms of Mortgage Loan Portfolio(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Due within 1 year(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Greater than 1 year but within 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Greater than 5 years but within 15 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Greater than 15 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family mortgage loan portfolio:(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale, at lower of cost or fair value </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for investment, at amortized cost: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Of Fannie Mae </td> <td> </td> <td>5,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Of consolidated trusts </td> <td> </td> <td>4,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>622,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,843,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,503,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total single-family mortgage loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,891,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,568,246 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family mortgage loan portfolio by interest rate sensitivity:(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-rate(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>622,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,866,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,533,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustable-rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total single-family mortgage loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,891,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,568,246 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We report the entire balance of the loan in the category that corresponds to the loan's remaining contractual maturity date.\n(2)Due within 1 year includes reverse mortgages for which there is no defined maturity date of $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n(3)Mortgage loans consist of the unpaid principal balance, premiums and discounts, hedge-related basis adjustments and other cost basis adjustments.

Our Multifamily business works with our multifamily lenders to provide funds to the mortgage market primarily by securitizing multifamily mortgage loans acquired from these lenders into Fannie Mae MBS, which are sold to investors or dealers. We also purchase multifamily mortgage loans and provide credit enhancement for bonds issued by state and local housing finance authorities to finance multifamily housing. Our Multifamily business also supports liquidity in the mortgage market through other activities, such as issuing structured MBS backed by Fannie Mae multifamily MBS and buying and selling multifamily agency mortgage-backed securities. We also continue to invest in low-income housing tax credit ( LIHTC\u201d) multifamily projects to help support and preserve the supply of affordable housing.\nKey Characteristics of the Multifamily Business\nThe Multifamily business has a number of key characteristics that distinguish it from our Single-Family business.\n\u2022Collateral: Multifamily loans are collateralized by properties that generate cash flows and effectively operate as businesses, such as garden and high-rise apartment complexes, seniors housing communities, cooperatives, dedicated student housing and manufactured housing communities.\n\u2022Borrowers and sponsors: Multifamily borrowers are entities that are typically owned, directly or indirectly, by for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, real estate investment trusts and individuals who invest in real estate for cash flow and expected returns in excess of their original contribution of equity. Borrowers are typically single-asset entities, with the property as their only asset. The ultimate owner of a multifamily borrower is referred to as the borrower's sponsor.\u201d We evaluate both the borrowing entity and its sponsor when considering a new transaction or managing our business. We refer to both the borrowing entities and their sponsors as borrowers.\u201d When considering a multifamily borrower, creditworthiness is evaluated through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data including liquid assets, net worth, number of units owned, experience in a market and/or property type, multifamily portfolio performance, access to additional liquidity, debt maturities, asset/property management platform, senior management experience, reputation, and exposures to lenders and Fannie Mae.\n\u2022Recourse: Multifamily loans are generally non-recourse to the borrowers.\n\u2022Lenders: During 2021, we executed multifamily transactions with 28 lenders. Of these, 23 lenders delivered loans to us under our DUS program described below. In determining whether to partner with a multifamily lender, we consider the lender's financial strength, multifamily underwriting and servicing experience, portfolio performance and willingness and ability to share in the risk of loss associated with the multifamily loans they originate.\n\u2022Loan size: The average size of a loan in our multifamily guaranty book of business is $14 million.\n\u2022Underwriting process: Multifamily loans require detailed underwriting of the property's operating cash flow. Our underwriting includes an evaluation of the property's ability to support the loan, property quality, market and submarket factors, and ability to exit at maturity.\n\u2022Term and lifecycle: In contrast to the standard 30-year single-family residential loan, multifamily loans typically have terms of 5, 7 or 10 years, with balloon payments due at maturity.\n\u2022Prepayment terms: To protect against prepayments, most multifamily Fannie Mae loans and MBS impose prepayment premiums, primarily yield maintenance, consistent with standard commercial investment terms. This is in contrast to single-family loans, which typically do not have prepayment protection.\nDelegated Underwriting and Servicing\nFannie Mae's DUS program, which was initiated in 1988, is a unique business model in the commercial mortgage industry. Our DUS model aligns the interests of the lender and Fannie Mae. Our current 23-member DUS lender network, which is composed of large financial institutions and independent mortgage lenders, continues to be our principal source of multifamily loan deliveries. DUS lenders are pre-approved and delegated the authority to underwrite and service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae in accordance with our standards and requirements. Delegation permits\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>119\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business </td> </tr>\n</table>\nlenders to respond to customers more rapidly, as the lender generally has the authority to approve a loan within prescribed parameters. Based on a given loan's unique characteristics and Fannie Mae's established delegation criteria, lenders assess whether a loan must be reviewed by Fannie Mae. If review is required, Fannie Mae's internal credit team will assess the loan's risk profile to determine if it meets our risk tolerances. DUS lenders are required to share with us the risk of loss over the life of the loan, as discussed in more detail in Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.\u201d Since DUS lenders share in the credit risk, the servicing fee to the lenders includes compensation for credit risk.\nMultifamily Mortgage Servicing\nMultifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell mortgages to us. Because of our loss-sharing arrangements with our multifamily lenders, transfers of multifamily servicing rights are infrequent, and we monitor our servicing relationships and enforce our right to approve servicing transfers. As a seller-servicer, the lender is responsible for ongoing evaluation of the financial condition of properties and property owners, administering various types of loan and property-level agreements (including agreements covering replacement reserves, completion or repair, and operations and maintenance), as well as conducting routine property inspections.\nMultifamily Credit Risk and Credit Loss Management\nOur Multifamily business:\n\u2022Prices and manages the credit risk on loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business. Lenders retain a portion of the credit risk in most multifamily transactions.\n\u2022Enters into transactions that transfer an additional portion of Fannie Mae's credit risk on some of the loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business through back-end credit risk transfer transactions.\n\u2022Works to maintain the credit quality of the multifamily book of business, prevents foreclosures through certain loss mitigation strategies such as forbearance or modification, reduces costs of defaulted multifamily loans, manages our REO inventory, and pursues contractual remedies from lenders, servicers, borrowers, and providers of credit enhancement.\nSee Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management\u201d for a discussion of our strategies for managing credit risk and credit losses on multifamily loans.\nThe Multifamily Markets in Which We Operate\nIn the multifamily mortgage market, we aim to address the rental housing needs of a wide range of the population in all markets across the country, with the substantial majority of our focus on supporting rental housing that is affordable to families earning at or below the median income in their area. We serve the market steadily, rather than moving in and out depending on market conditions. Through the secondary mortgage market, we support rental housing for the workforce population, for senior citizens and students, and for families with the greatest economic need. Nearly 95% of the multifamily units we financed in 2021 were affordable to families earning at or below 120% of the median income in their area, providing support for both workforce housing and affordable housing.\nOur Multifamily business is organized and operated as an integrated commercial real estate finance business, addressing the spectrum of multifamily housing finance needs, including the need for smaller multifamily property financing and financing that serves low- and very low-income households.\n\u2022To meet the growing need for smaller multifamily property financing, we focus on the acquisition of small multifamily loans, which includes loans of up to $6 million in original unpaid principal balance. As of December 31, 2021, small loans represented 42% of our multifamily guaranty book of business by loan count and 7% based on unpaid principal balance.\n\u2022To serve low- and very low-income households, we have a team that focuses exclusively on relationships with lenders financing privately-owned multifamily properties that receive public subsidies in exchange for maintaining long-term affordable rents. We enable borrowers to leverage housing programs and subsidies provided by local, state and federal agencies. These public subsidy programs are largely targeted to provide housing to families earning less than 60% of area median income (as defined by HUD) and are structured to ensure that the low- and very low-income households who benefit from the subsidies pay no more than 30% of their gross monthly income for rent and utilities. As of December 31, 2021, affordable loans represented approximately 11% of our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on unpaid principal balance, including $8.3 billion in bond credit enhancements.\nOur acquisition of loans financing smaller multifamily properties and serving low-and very-low income households help us meet our multifamily housing goals and FHFA's scorecard requirement for us that a portion of our multifamily volume\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>120\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business </td> </tr>\n</table>\nbe focused on affordable and underserved markets. We discuss our housing goals in Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE-Focused Matters-Housing Goals\u201d and our scorecard requirement to focus on affordable and underserved markets in Multifamily Business Metrics.\u201d\nMultifamily Lenders and Investors\nIn support of equitable and sustainable access to quality affordable rental housing across America, our multifamily business works primarily with mortgage banking companies, large diversified financial institutions, and banks. During 2021, our top five multifamily lenders, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 46% of our multifamily business volume, compared with approximately 47% in 2020. One of our lenders, Walker & Dunlop, accounted for 14% of our 2021 multifamily business volume. No other lender accounted for more than 10% of our multifamily business volume in 2021.\nWe have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of multifamily Fannie Mae MBS include fund managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. Our Multifamily Connecticut Avenue SecuritiesTM ( MCASTM\u201d) investors include fund managers, hedge funds and insurance companies, while our Multifamily CIRTTM ( MCIRTTM\u201d) transactions are executed with insurers and reinsurers.\nMultifamily Competition\nCompetition to acquire mortgage assets is significantly affected by both our and our competitors' pricing, credit standards and loan structures, lender preferences, investor demand for our and our competitors' mortgage-related securities, and actions we take to support affordable multifamily housing. Our competitive environment also may be affected by many other factors, including direction from FHFA; changes in our obligations under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury or in our capital requirements; new legislation or regulations applicable to us, our lenders or investors; and digital innovation and disruption in our markets. Our competitive environment in 2021 was influenced by FHFA's cap on our multifamily business volume and related requirements that specified percentages of our multifamily volume be focused on affordable and underserved markets, including residents at 60% of area median income or below. We expect that FHFA's 2022 multifamily business volume cap and related requirements will continue to influence our competitive landscape. The volume cap and related requirement are described below in Multifamily Business Metrics.\u201d\nOur primary competitors for the acquisition of multifamily mortgage assets and issuance of multifamily mortgage-related securities are Freddie Mac, life insurers, U.S. banks and thrifts, other institutional investors, Ginnie Mae and private-label issuers of commercial mortgage-backed securities. See Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform,\u201d Business-Legislation and Regulation,\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for information on matters that could affect our business and competitive environment.\nMultifamily Mortgage Market\nMultifamily market fundamentals, which include factors such as vacancy rates and rents, remained positive during the fourth quarter of 2021, due to pent up demand for multifamily housing stemming from a rebounding economy, including increasing job growth, higher wages and an elevated level of household savings.\n\u2022Vacancy rates. Based on preliminary third-party data, the estimated national multifamily vacancy rate for institutional investment-type apartment properties as of December 31, 2021 remained at 5.0% compared with September 30, 2021 and decreased compared with 6.0% as of December 31, 2020. The estimated national multifamily vacancy rate remains below its estimated average rate of about 6.0% over the last 10 years.\n\u2022Rents. Effective rents are estimated to have increased by 3.0% during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with an increase of 3.5% during the third quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Annualized rent growth for 2021 is estimated to have been 10.0%.\nVacancy rates and rents are important to loan performance because multifamily loans are generally repaid from the cash flows generated by the underlying property. Several years of improvement in these fundamentals helped to increase property values in most metropolitan areas. Based on preliminary multifamily property sales data, transaction volumes for 2021 appear poised for a new peak, with capitalization rates having compressed slightly. We believe this is due to property owners benefiting from strong market conditions and commercial real estate investors remaining interested in the multifamily sector over the long term.\nMultifamily construction underway remains elevated, with more than 386,000 units expected to have been delivered in 2021, compared with the estimated 404,000 new multifamily units that were completed in 2020.\nWe expect the multifamily sector to continue benefiting from an improving economy and continued job growth, with rent growth moderating but remaining above normalized levels over the coming months.\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>121\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Market Activity </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMultifamily Market Activity\nWe remained a continuous source of liquidity in the multifamily market in 2021.

FHFA also required that at least 50% of our 2021 multifamily business volume be mission-driven, focused on specified affordable and underserved market segments. Furthermore, FHFA's 2021 multifamily volume cap required that a minimum of 20% of our multifamily business volume in 2021 be affordable to residents at 60% of area median income or below. Multifamily business that met the minimum 20% requirement also counted as meeting the minimum 50% requirement. Our 2021 multifamily new business volume remained under the cap by approximately $500 million, and we have met the mission requirements established by FHFA.\nIn October 2021, FHFA announced that the multifamily loan purchase cap for 2022 will be $78 billion. As in 2021, a minimum of 50% of loan purchases must be mission-driven, focused on specified affordable and underserved market segments. In addition, 25% of loan purchases must be affordable to residents earning 60% or less of area median income, up from the 20% requirement in 2021.\nSee Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements-Covenants under Treasury Agreements\u201d for more information about a limit on our acquisition of multifamily mortgage assets that was added to our senior preferred stock purchase agreement in January 2021 and temporarily suspended in September 2021.

By contrast, the multifamily guaranty book of business presented in the Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business\u201d table in the Guaranty Book of Business\u201d section is based on the unpaid principal balance of Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been remitted to the MBS holders.\nMultifamily Guaranty Book of Business\n(Dollars in billions)\n(1)Our multifamily guaranty book of business primarily consists of multifamily mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, multifamily mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on multifamily mortgage assets. It does not include non-Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty.\nAverage charged guaranty fee represents our effective revenue rate relative to the size of our multifamily guaranty book of business. Management uses this metric to assess the return we earn as compensation for the multifamily credit risk we manage. Average charged guaranty fee increased in 2021 compared with 2020 due to increased pricing on new multifamily business. Our multifamily guaranty fee pricing is primarily based on the individual credit risk characteristics of the loans we acquire and the aggregate credit risk characteristics of our portfolio, but it is also influenced by market forces such as the availability of other sources of liquidity, our mission-related goals, the FHFA volume cap and the management of our overall portfolio composition.\nTable

Multifamily loans that we purchase or that back Fannie Mae MBS are underwritten by a Fannie Mae-approved lender and may be subject to our underwriting review prior to closing, depending on the product type, loan size, market and/or other factors. Our underwriting standards generally include, among other things, property cash flow analysis and third-party appraisals.\nAdditionally, our standards for multifamily loans specify maximum original LTV ratio and minimum original debt service coverage ratio ( DSCR\u201d) values that vary based on loan characteristics. Our experience has been that original LTV ratio and DSCR values have been reliable indicators of future credit performance. At underwriting, we evaluate the DSCR based on both actual and underwritten debt service payments. The original DSCR is calculated using the underwritten debt service payments for the loan, which assumes both principal and interest payments, rather than the actual debt service payments. Depending on the loan's interest rate and structure, using the underwritten debt service payments may result in a more conservative estimate of the debt service payments (for example, loans with an interest-only period). This approach is used for all loans, including those with full and partial interest-only terms.\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>126\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo address possible fluctuations in borrower income and expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted additional reserve requirements in 2020 for certain new multifamily loan acquisitions depending on the product type, LTV ratio and DSCR.

Information in our quarterly financial supplements is not incorporated by reference into this report.\nTransfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk\nLender risk-sharing is a cornerstone of our Multifamily business. We primarily transfer risk through our DUS program, which delegates to DUS lenders the ability to underwrite and service multifamily loans, in accordance with our standards and requirements. DUS lenders receive credit risk-related revenues for their respective portion of credit risk retained, and, in turn, are required to fulfill any loss-sharing obligation. This aligns the interests of the lender and Fannie Mae throughout the life of the loan. We monitor the capital resources and loss-sharing capacity of our DUS lenders on an ongoing basis.\nOur DUS model typically results in our lenders sharing approximately one-third of the credit risk on our multifamily loans, either on a pro-rata or tiered basis. Lenders who share on a tiered basis cover loan-level credit losses up to the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance of the loan and then share with us any remaining losses up to a prescribed limit. Loans serviced by DUS lenders and their affiliates represented substantially all of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. In certain situations, to effectively manage our counterparty risk, we do not allow the lender to fully share in one-third of the credit risk, but have them share in a smaller portion.\nWhile not a large portion of our multifamily guaranty book of business, our non-DUS lenders typically also have lender risk-sharing, where the lenders typically share or absorb losses based on a negotiated percentage of the loan or the pool balance.\nThese lender risk-sharing agreements not only transfer credit risk, but also better align our interests with those of the lenders. Our maximum potential loss recovery from lenders under current risk-sharing agreements represented over 20% of the unpaid principal balance of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTo complement our front-end lender-risk sharing program, we engage in back-end credit risk transfer transactions through our MCIRT and MCAS transactions. Through these transactions, we transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a reference pool of multifamily mortgage loans to insurers, reinsurers, or investors.\nOur back-end multifamily credit-risk sharing transactions were primarily designed to further reduce the capital requirements associated with loans in the reference pool with the related benefit of additional credit risk protection in the event of a stress environment. We transfer multifamily credit risk through lender risk-sharing at the time of acquisition, but our multifamily back-end credit risk transfer activity occurs later, typically up to a year or more after acquisition.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into two new credit risk transfer transactions, transferring mortgage credit risk through our MCIRT program. These transactions were the first new multifamily credit risk transfer transactions we entered into since the first quarter of 2020. The structure of and extent to which we engage in any additional credit risk transfer transactions in the future may be affected by our capital requirements, the degree of regulatory capital relief provided by the transactions, our risk appetite, the strength of future market conditions, the cost of these transactions, FHFA guidance, and the review of our overall business and capital plan.\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>127\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the total unpaid principal balance of multifamily loans and the percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on unpaid principal balance, that is covered by a back-end credit risk transfer transaction.

We require lenders to provide quarterly and annual financial updates for the loans for which we are contractually entitled to receive such information. We closely monitor loans with an estimated current DSCR below 1.0, as that is an indicator of heightened default risk. The percentage of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business, calculated based on unpaid principal balance, with a current DSCR less than 1.0 was approximately 2% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our estimates of current DSCRs are based on the latest available income information from annual statements for the included properties.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, we track the following credit risk characteristics to determine loan credit quality indicators, which are the internal risk categories we use and which are further discussed in Note 3, Mortgage Loans\u201d:\n\u2022the physical condition of the property;\n\u2022delinquency status;\n\u2022the relevant local market and economic conditions that may signal changing risk or return profiles; and\n\u2022other risk factors.\nFor example, we closely monitor rental payment trends and vacancy levels in local markets, as well as capitalization rates, to identify loans that merit closer attention or loss mitigation actions. We manage our exposure to refinancing risk for multifamily loans maturing in the next several years. We have a team that proactively manages upcoming loan maturities to minimize losses on maturing loans. This team assists lenders and borrowers with timely and appropriate refinancing of maturing loans with the goal of reducing defaults and foreclosures related to these loans. The primary asset management responsibilities for our multifamily loans are performed by our DUS and other multifamily lenders. We periodically evaluate these lenders' performance for compliance with our asset management criteria.\nMultifamily Problem Loan Management and Foreclosure Prevention\nIn addition to the credit performance information on our multifamily loans provided below, we provide information about multifamily loans in a COVID-19-related forbearance that back MBS and whole loan REMICs in a Multifamily MBS COVID-19 Forbearance List\u201d in the Data Collections\u201d section of our DUS Disclose\u00ae tool, available at www.fanniemae.com/dusdisclose. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.\nWe periodically refine our underwriting standards in response to market conditions and implement proactive portfolio management and monitoring which are each designed to keep credit losses and delinquencies to a low level relative to our multifamily guaranty book of business.\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>128\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelinquency Statistics on our Problem Loans\nThe percentage of our multifamily loans classified as substandard in our guaranty book of business increased as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020, due to the continued impact of COVID-19. Substandard loans are loans that have a well-defined weakness that could impact their timely full repayment. While the majority of the substandard loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business are currently making timely payments or are in forbearance, we continue to monitor the performance of our substandard loan population. For more information on our credit quality indicators, including our population of substandard loans, see Note 3, Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nOur multifamily serious delinquency rate decreased to 0.42% as of December 31, 2021, compared with 0.98% as of December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing economic recovery resulting in loans that received forbearance resolving their delinquency through completion of their repayment plans or otherwise reinstating. Our multifamily serious delinquency rate consists of multifamily loans that were 60 days or more past due based on unpaid principal balance, expressed as a percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business. Our multifamily serious delinquency rate includes 0.23% of multifamily loans that were 180 days or more past due as of December 31, 2021 compared with 0.50% as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement monitors the multifamily serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with multifamily loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses.\nOur multifamily serious delinquency rate, excluding loans that received a forbearance, was 0.04% as of December 31, 2021, compared with 0.03% as of December 31, 2020. We monitor the multifamily serious delinquency rate excluding loans that received a forbearance to better understand the impact that forbearance activity has had on the rate and to monitor loans that are seriously delinquent not as a result of COVID-19 or natural disasters.\nCOVID-19 Forbearance and Multifamily Eviction Moratorium\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, we broadly offered forbearance to affected multifamily borrowers. In 2020, we delegated to our lenders the ability to provide forbearance for up to six monthly payments for most loan types. In September 2021, FHFA extended our program to provide forbearance for multifamily loans impacted by COVID-19 indefinitely. While the forbearance program remains in place, the delegation to our lenders expired on September 30, 2021. As a result, we determine whether to offer forbearance relief based on the borrower's circumstances through our normal loss mitigation procedures. For delegated forbearances, borrowers are required to bring their loans current within a time period determined by multiplying the number of months of forbearance by four. For example, a three-month forbearance would translate into a twelve-month repayment period. In exchange for receiving forbearance, borrowers must agree to suspend tenant evictions for nonpayment of rent, provide monthly operating statements and remit any excess cash flow to our servicers on a monthly basis, to be held until the end of the forbearance period and then applied to missed mortgage payments.\nMultifamily Loan Forbearance\nAs of December 31, 2021, nearly all of our multifamily loans that have received forbearance were associated with a COVID-19-related financial hardship, but only a small portion of these loans remained in forbearance. Seniors housing loans, which constituted 4% of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2021, accounted for approximately 42% of the total unpaid principal balance of multifamily loans that received a forbearance and remained in our multifamily guaranty book as of December 31, 2021. Of those multifamily seniors housing loans that received a forbearance and were still active on our guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2021, based on unpaid principal balance, 91% were reinstated, 6% were in a repayment plan, 1% were in active forbearance, and the remaining 2% had defaulted on their forbearance arrangement.\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>129\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the status as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of the active multifamily loans in our guaranty book of business that have received a forbearance since the start of the pandemic, as well as the serious delinquency rate of such loans.

Of the $957 million in loans that liquidated prior to December 31, 2021, $238 million went to foreclosure prior to that date, largely as a result of the foreclosure of loans within a seniors housing portfolio. There were no multifamily loans that received a forbearance after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that went to foreclosure prior to December 31, 2020.\n(2)Includes loans that are in the process of extending their forbearance.\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>130\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(3)Represents loans that are no longer in forbearance but that are current according to the original terms of the loan or that have been modified and are performing under the modification.\n(4)Includes loans that are no longer in forbearance and are not on a repayment plan. Loans in this population may proceed to other loss mitigation activities, such as modification, or to foreclosure.\nUnder our nonaccrual accounting policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months provided that the loans were either current as of March 1, 2020 or originated after March 1, 2020. Multifamily loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the borrower is six months past due unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information about our nonaccrual accounting policy.\nFor multifamily loans that received forbearance and were in our book of business as of December 31, 2021, we have recorded a total accrued interest receivable balance of $29 million, for which we have established a valuation allowance of $2 million.\nREO Management\nThe number of multifamily foreclosed properties held for sale was 31 properties with a carrying value of $302 million as of December 31, 2021, compared with 14 properties with a carrying value of $114 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the loans in a seniors housing portfolio that defaulted on their forbearance arrangements in 2020. The majority of the loans in this portfolio that defaulted on the terms of their forbearance agreement were foreclosed upon in 2021.\nWe expect to see additional foreclosures on loans that received a COVID-19 forbearance that are unable to successfully cure their delinquency through a repayment plan or other modification.\nOther Multifamily Credit Information\nMultifamily Credit Loss Performance Metrics\nThe amount of multifamily credit loss or income we realize in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, REO activity and write-offs, net of recoveries. Our multifamily credit loss performance metrics are not defined terms and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe our multifamily credit losses and our multifamily credit losses, net of freestanding loss-sharing benefit, may be useful to stakeholders because they display our credit losses in the context of our multifamily guaranty book of business, including the benefit we receive from loss-sharing arrangements.

The rate excludes write-offs not associated with foreclosures or other liquidation events (such as a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or a short-sale) and any costs, gains or losses associated with REO after initial acquisition through final disposition. Write-offs are net of lender loss-sharing agreements.\nWe had lower multifamily credit losses in 2021 than in 2020, primarily as a result of a seniors housing loan portfolio defaulting on its forbearance arrangements in 2020. This default led to a write-down during 2020, which increased our losses for 2020. We subsequently recognized recoveries on that loan portfolio, which contributed to lower credit losses in 2021.\nAlthough we have already realized some credit losses related to COVID-19-impacted loans in recent periods, we expect our realized multifamily credit losses may remain higher over the next few years compared to pre-pandemic levels as some loans that have been materially impacted by COVID-19 are ultimately unable to reperform.\nMultifamily Credit Ratios and Select Credit Information\nThe table below displays select credit ratios on our multifamily guaranty book of business, as well as the inputs used in calculating those ratios.\nTable 349: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily Credit Ratios and Select Credit Information\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Select multifamily credit ratios: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of guaranty book of business </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserves as a percentage of multifamily: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranty book of business </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td>54.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Select multifamily financial information used in calculating credit ratios: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserves(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,225) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranty book of business </td> <td> </td> <td>413,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of multifamily credit loss reserves: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(679) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,208) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(257) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for accrued interest receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for guaranty losses(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total credit loss reserves(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,225) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Our multifamily credit loss reserves consist of our allowance for loan losses and the related accrued interest receivable, and our reserve for guaranty losses.

Our liquidity risk management requirements are designed to address our liquidity and funding risk, which is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations when they come due, including the risk associated with the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity and funding risk management involves forecasting funding requirements, maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our needs based on our ongoing assessment of financial market liquidity and adhering to our regulatory requirements.\nPrimary Sources and Uses of Funds\nOur liquidity depends largely on our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, including both corporate debt and sales of our MBS securities. Our status as a government-sponsored enterprise and continued federal government support is essential to maintaining our access to the debt markets. Substantially all of our sources and uses of funds identified below are both short-term and long-term in nature.\nOur primary sources of cash include:\n\u2022issuance of long-term and short-term corporate debt;\n\u2022proceeds from the sale of mortgage-related securities, mortgage loans and other investments portfolio, including proceeds from sales of foreclosed real estate assets;\n\u2022principal and interest payments received on mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and non-mortgage investments we own;\nTable 354: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>133\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022guaranty fees received on Fannie Mae MBS, including the TCCA fees collected by us on behalf of Treasury;\n\u2022payments received from mortgage insurance counterparties and other providers of credit enhancement; and\n\u2022borrowings we may make under a secured intraday funding line of credit or against mortgage-related securities and other investment securities we hold pursuant to repurchase agreements and loan agreements.\nOur primary uses of funds include:\n\u2022the repayment of matured, redeemed and repurchased debt;\n\u2022the purchase of mortgage loans (including delinquent loans from MBS trusts), mortgage-related securities and other investments;\n\u2022interest payments on outstanding debt;\n\u2022administrative expenses;\n\u2022losses, including advances for past due principal and interest, incurred in connection with our Fannie Mae MBS guaranty obligations;\n\u2022payments of federal income taxes;\n\u2022payments of TCCA fees to Treasury; and\n\u2022payments associated with our credit risk transfer programs.\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management Practices and Contingency Planning\nOur liquidity position could be adversely affected by many factors, both internal and external to our business, including:\n\u2022actions taken by FHFA, the Federal Reserve, Treasury or other government agencies;\n\u2022legislation relating to us or our business;\n\u2022a U.S. government payment default on its debt obligations;\n\u2022a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt or the U.S. government's debt from the major ratings organizations;\n\u2022a systemic event leading to the withdrawal of liquidity from the market;\n\u2022an extreme market-wide widening of credit spreads;\n\u2022public statements by key policy makers;\n\u2022a significant decline in our net worth;\n\u2022potential investor concerns about the adequacy of funding available to us under or about changes to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement;\n\u2022loss of demand for our debt, or certain types of our debt from a significant number of investors;\n\u2022a significant credit event involving one of our major institutional counterparties;\n\u2022a sudden catastrophic operational failure in the financial sector; or\n\u2022elimination of our status as a government-sponsored enterprise.\nSee Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe maintain a liquidity management framework and conduct liquidity contingency planning to prepare for an event in which our access to the unsecured debt markets becomes limited.\nOur liquidity requirements have four components we must meet:\n\u2022a short-term cash flow metric that requires us to meet our expected cash outflows and continue to provide liquidity to the market over a 30-day period of stress, plus an additional $10 billion buffer;\n\u2022an intermediate cash flow metric that requires us to meet our expected cash outflows and continue to provide liquidity to the market over a 365-day period of stress;\n\u2022a specified minimum long-term debt to less-liquid asset ratio. Less-liquid assets are those that are not eligible to be pledged as collateral to Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; and\n\u2022a requirement that we fund our assets with liabilities that have a specified minimum term relative to the term of the assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with these requirements.\nTable 356: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>134\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe run routine operational testing of our ability to rely upon mortgage and U.S. Treasury collateral to obtain financing. We enter into relatively small repurchase agreements in order to confirm that we have the operational and systems capability to do so. In addition, we have provided collateral in advance to clearing banks in the event we seek to enter into repurchase agreements in the future. We do not, however, have committed repurchase agreements with specific counterparties, as historically we have not relied on this form of funding. As a result, our use of such facilities and our ability to enter into them in significant dollar amounts may be challenging in a stressed market environment. See Other Investments Portfolio\u201d for further discussions of our alternative sources of liquidity if our access to the debt markets were to become limited.\nWhile our liquidity contingency planning attempts to address stressed market conditions and our status in conservatorship, we believe those plans could be difficult or impossible to execute under stressed conditions for a company of our size in our circumstances. See Risk Factors-Liquidity and Funding Risk\u201d for a description of the risks associated with our ability to fund operations and our liquidity contingency planning.\nDebt Funding\nWe separately present the debt from consolidations ( Debt of consolidated trusts\u201d) and the debt issued by us ( Debt of Fannie Mae\u201d) in our consolidated balance sheets. This discussion regarding debt funding focuses on the debt of Fannie Mae. In addition to MBS issuances, we fund our business through the issuance of a variety of short-term and long-term debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets. Accordingly, we are subject to roll over,\u201d or refinancing, risk on our outstanding debt.\nOur debt securities are actively traded in the over-the-counter market. We have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of our debt securities are geographically diversified and include fund managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign central banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. We compete for low-cost debt funding with institutions that hold mortgage portfolios, including Freddie Mac and the FHLBs.\nOur debt funding needs and debt funding activity may vary from period to period depending on market conditions, including refinance volumes, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our capital and liquidity management, and the size of our retained mortgage portfolio. See Retained Mortgage Portfolio\u201d for information about our retained mortgage portfolio and limits on its size.\nWe are currently subject to a $300 billion debt limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, which will decrease to $270 billion as of December 31, 2022. The unpaid principal balance of our aggregate indebtedness was $202.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, we are prohibited from issuing debt without the prior consent of Treasury if it would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding our outstanding debt limit. The calculation of our indebtedness for purposes of complying with our debt limit reflects the unpaid principal balance and excludes debt basis adjustments and debt of consolidated trusts. Because of our debt limit, our business activities may be constrained.\nOutstanding Debt\nTotal outstanding debt of Fannie Mae includes short-term and long-term debt and excludes debt of consolidated trusts. Short-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and, therefore, does not include the current portion of long-term debt. Long-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year.\nTable 358: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>135\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following chart and table display information on our outstanding short-term and long-term debt based on original contractual maturity. The driver for the decrease in long-term debt from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was decreased funding needs compared with the prior year. In 2020, we had unusually high liquidity demands driven by our expectations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as historically high loan acquisition volumes through our whole loan conduit, resulting in high volumes of debt issuance during the year. Our funding needs were lower in 2021 because we built up a large amount of liquidity through our debt issuances in 2020, our expected loan buyouts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have declined, and we are now able to retain more of our earnings pursuant to the terms of the January 2021 amendment to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. As a result of our lower funding needs, the new debt we issued during 2021 replaced only some of our debt that paid off with no new long-term debt issuance after the first quarter of 2021.\nDebt of Fannie Mae1\n(Dollars in billions)\n(1)Outstanding debt balance consists of the unpaid principal balance, premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments, hedge-related basis adjustments and other cost basis adjustments. There were no hedge-related basis adjustments in 2020. Reported amounts include net discount unamortized cost basis adjustments and fair value adjustments of $1.6 billion and $393 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2)Short-term debt was $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nTable 360: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>136\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Debt Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in billions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Weighted-Average Interest Rates(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate on short-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate on long-term debt, including portion maturing within one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate on callable long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Maturity Data </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average maturity of debt maturing within one year (in days)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td>196 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average maturity of debt maturing in more than one year (in months)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Data </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding callable long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Connecticut Avenue Securities debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Excludes the effects of fair value adjustments and hedge-related basis adjustments.\n(2)Represents CAS debt issued prior to November 2018.

These arrangements are commonly referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d and expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements result primarily from the following:\n\u2022our guaranty of mortgage loan securitization and resecuritization transactions over which we have no control, which are reflected in our unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS net of any beneficial ownership interest we retain, and other financial guarantees that we do not control;\n\u2022liquidity support transactions; and\n\u2022partnership interests.\nThe total amount of our off-balance sheet exposure related to unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS net of any beneficial interest that we retain, and other financial guarantees was $226.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $153.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The majority of the other financial guarantees consists of Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae structured securities. See Guaranty Book of Business\u201d and Note 6, Financial Guarantees\u201d for more information regarding our maximum exposure to loss on unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac securities.\nOur total outstanding liquidity commitments to advance funds for securities backed by multifamily housing revenue bonds totaled $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. These commitments require us to advance funds to third parties that enable them to repurchase tendered bonds or securities that are unable to be remarketed. We hold cash and cash equivalents in our other investments portfolio in excess of these commitments to advance funds.\nWe make investments in various limited partnerships and similar legal entities, which consist of low-income housing tax credit investments, community investments and other entities. When we do not have a controlling financial interest in those entities, our consolidated balance sheets reflect only our investment rather than the full amount of the partnership's assets and liabilities. See Note 2, Consolidations and Transfers of Financial Assets-Unconsolidated VIEs\u201d for information regarding our limited partnerships and similar legal entities.\nEquity Funding\nAt this time, as a result of the covenants under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, Treasury's ownership of the warrant to purchase up to 79.9% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding and the uncertainty regarding our future, we do not have access to equity funding except through draws under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. For a description of the funding available and the covenants under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, see Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements.\u201d\nTable 368: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>139\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations that affect our liquidity and capital resource requirements. These contractual obligations primarily consist of debt obligations (and associated interest payment obligations) and mortgage purchase commitments recognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\u2022For information about the amounts, maturities and contractual interest rates of our obligations related to debt, see Note 7, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt.\u201d\n\u2022For information about our mortgage purchase commitments, leases and other purchase obligations, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOur contractual obligations also include $1.2 billion in cash received as collateral and future cash payments due under our unconditional and legally binding obligations to fund low-income housing tax credit partnership investments and other partnerships. These amounts are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets under Other liabilities.\u201d\nIn addition, our short and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs may be affected by our contractual obligations to make the payments listed below. The amounts of these payments are uncertain and will depend on future events:\n\u2022payments on our obligations to stand ready to perform under our guarantees relating to Fannie Mae MBS and other financial guarantees, including Fannie Mae commingled structured securities. The amount and timing of payments under these arrangements are generally contingent upon the occurrence of future events. For a description of the amount of our on- and off-balance sheet Fannie Mae MBS and other financial guarantees as of December 31, 2021, see Guaranty Book of Business\u201d and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d earlier in this section;\n\u2022payments associated with our CIRT, CAS REMIC, MCAS, and CAS CLN transactions, the amount and timing of which are contingent upon the occurrence of future credit and prepayment events for the related reference pool of mortgage loans.

The balance of our other investments portfolio fluctuates as a result of changes in our cash flows, liquidity in the fixed-income markets, and our liquidity risk management framework and practices.\nOur other investments portfolio decreased during 2021 primarily as a result of a change in how funds held by consolidated trusts are invested, which resulted in a decrease in our holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. In the first quarter of 2021, we began to invest funds held by consolidated trusts directly in eligible short-term third-party investments. As the funds underlying these investments are restricted per the trust agreements, these securities are not considered in our sources of liquidity and are excluded from our other investments portfolio. Prior to this change, funds held by consolidated trusts were invested in Fannie Mae short-term debt, as allowed by the trust agreements. We then invested those proceeds in unrestricted short-term investments, which were included in our other investments portfolio. This change did not materially alter our liquidity position.\nWe used cash and other liquid assets that accumulated in 2020 to fund our operations during 2021; however, our other investments portfolio remains elevated from pre-pandemic levels. Due to lower overall funding needs in 2021, we reduced our debt issuances during this period, which also resulted in a reduction in our other investments portfolio as maturing investments were not replaced. In addition, we reduced our investments in securities purchased under agreements to resell and invested more in overnight repurchase agreements, which are classified as cash equivalents, as a result of market conditions.\nOther Investments Portfolio\n(Dollars in billions)\n(1)Cash equivalents are composed of overnight repurchase agreements and U.S. Treasuries that have a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings from the major credit ratings organizations, as well as the credit ratings of the U.S. government, are primary factors that could affect our ability to access the capital markets and our cost of funds. In addition, our credit ratings are important when we seek to engage in certain long-term transactions, such as derivative transactions. Standard & Poor's Global Ratings ( S&P\u201d), Moody's Investors Services ( Moody's\u201d) and Fitch Ratings Limited ( Fitch\u201d) have all indicated that, if they were to lower the sovereign credit ratings on the U.S., they would likely lower their ratings on the debt of Fannie Mae and certain other government-related entities. In addition, actions by governmental entities impacting Treasury's support for our business or our debt securities could adversely affect the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt. See Risk Factors-Liquidity and Funding Risk\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our business relating to a decrease in our credit ratings, which could include an increase in our borrowing costs, limits on our ability to issue debt, and additional collateral requirements under our derivatives contracts.\nTable 372: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>141\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below displays the credit ratings issued by the three major credit rating agencies.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased from $115.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $108.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by cash outflows from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) the redemption of funding debt, which outpaced issuances, primarily for the reasons described above.\nPartially offsetting these cash outflows were cash inflows primarily from (1) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties, (2) proceeds from repayments and sales of loans, and (3) a decrease in our investment in U.S. Treasury securities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased from $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 to $115.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by cash inflows from (1) proceeds from repayments and sales of loans, (2) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties, and (3) the issuance of funding debt, which outpaced redemptions, primarily for the reasons described above.\nPartially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows primarily from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) an increase in our investment in U.S Treasury securities.\nCapital Management\nCapital Requirements\nAs discussed below, we currently have a significant deficit of core capital relative to our statutory minimum capital requirement. Moreover, the enterprise regulatory capital framework, when it is fully applicable, will require us to hold more capital than the statutory requirement.\nStatutory Minimum Capital\nFHFA stated that, during conservatorship, our statutory regulatory capital requirements, as well as prior FHFA-directed regulatory capital requirements, will not be binding and that FHFA will not issue quarterly capital classifications. See Note 12, Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d for information on the amount of regulatory capital we held as of December 31, 2021. The deficit of our core capital relative to statutory minimum capital established in the GSE Act was $100.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $124.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Under the statutory capital requirements, core capital, as defined, does not include the value of the senior preferred stock.\nEnterprise Regulatory Capital Framework\nFHFA established an enterprise regulatory capital framework pursuant to its authority under the GSE Act, as described in Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE-Focused Matters-Capital.\u201d The enterprise regulatory capital framework requires significantly higher levels of capital than what is required under our statutory minimum capital requirements. The enterprise regulatory capital framework went into effect in February 2021, but we are not currently required to hold capital according to the framework's requirements. The dates on which we must comply with the quantitative requirements of the enterprise regulatory capital framework are staggered and largely dependent on whether we remain in conservatorship. We are required to report capital amounts as determined under the enterprise regulatory capital framework for periods beginning after 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had a significant deficit relative to the amount of capital required under the enterprise regulatory capital framework.\nTable 375: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>142\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 376: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Assessment Process\nDuring 2021, we continued to develop capital management capabilities to align with requirements under the enterprise regulatory capital framework and to formalize our approach to assessing the adequacy of our capital to support current and future activities. Our approach includes our methodology for determining capital targets, ongoing monitoring, and internal communication regarding our capital position and adequacy. As part of our approach, we have established guidance on capital management considerations for use by decisionmakers, allowing them to assess relevant factors and exercise their discretion appropriately depending on circumstances. We actively monitor our current capital levels and anticipated changes in available and required capital. As part of managing our capital, we engage in planning for actions to take depending on our capital needs. This planning is linked to periodic capital adequacy monitoring, which enables us to identify and assess actual and potential changes in our capital levels and requirements.\nCapital Activity\nUnder the terms governing the senior preferred stock, no dividends were payable to Treasury for the fourth quarter of 2021 and none are payable for the first quarter of 2022. Also, the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased to $163.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and will further increase to $168.9 billion as of March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, our net worth was $47.4 billion. See Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements\u201d for more information on the terms of our senior preferred stock.\nRisk Management Table 377: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manage the risks that arise from our business activities through our enterprise risk management program. Our risk management activities are aligned with the requirements of FHFA's Enterprise Risk Management Advisory Bulletin, which are consistent with the general principles set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's ( COSO\u201d) Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM\u201d): Integrating with Strategy and Performance framework.\nWe are exposed to the following major risk categories:\n\u2022Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from another party's failure to meet its contractual obligations. For financial securities or instruments, credit risk is the risk of not receiving principal, interest or other financial obligation on a timely basis. Our credit risk exposure exists primarily in connection with our guaranty book of business and our institutional counterparties.\n\u2022Market Risk. Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in the economic environment. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and other market rates and prices. Market risk includes interest-rate risk, which is the risk that movements in interest rates will adversely affect the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings. Market risk also includes spread risk, which can result in losses from changes in the spreads between our mortgage assets and our debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position.\n\u2022Liquidity and Funding Risk. Liquidity and funding risk is the risk to our financial condition and resilience arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due, including the risk associated with the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels.\n\u2022Operational Risk. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or disruptions from external events. Operational risk includes cyber/information security risk, third-party risk and model risk.\nWe are also exposed to these additional risk categories:\n\u2022Strategic Risk. Strategic risk is the risk of loss resulting from poor business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions or the failure to respond appropriately to changes in the industry or external environment.\n\u2022Compliance Risk. Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, damage to current or projected financial condition, damage to business resilience or damage to reputation resulting from nonconformance with compliance obligations. These obligations include laws or regulations, prescribed practices, MBS trust agreements, supervisory guidance, conservator instruction, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards governing how we operate. Compliance risk exposes us to adverse actions by regulators, law enforcement or other government agencies, or private civil action, and financial losses incurred through fines, legal judgments, voiding of contracts or civil penalties. Compliance risk can result in damaged or diminished reputation, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.\nTable 378: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>143\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 379: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Reputational Risk. Reputational risk is the risk that substantial negative publicity may cause a decline in public perception of us, a decline in our customer base, costly litigation, revenue reductions or losses.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, see Risk Factors.\u201d\nComponents of Risk Management\nOur risk management program is composed of four inter-related components that are designed to work together as a comprehensive risk management system aimed at enhancing our performance.\nTable 380: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>144\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 381: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRisk Management Governance\nWe manage risk by using the industry standard three lines of defense\u201d structure. Our Board of Directors and management-level risk committees are also integral to our risk management program.\nMortgage Credit Risk Management Overview\nMortgage credit risk arises from the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower to make required mortgage payments. We are exposed to credit risk on our book of business because we either hold mortgage assets, have issued a guaranty in connection with the creation of Fannie Mae MBS backed by mortgage assets or have provided other credit enhancements on mortgage assets. For more information on how we manage mortgage credit risk, see Business-Managing Mortgage Credit Risk,\u201d Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.\u201d\nClimate Change and Natural Disaster Risk Management\nMajor weather events or other natural disasters expose us to credit risk in a variety of ways, including by damaging properties that secure mortgage loans in our book of business and by negatively impacting the ability of borrowers to make payments on their mortgage loans. The amount of losses we incur as a result of a major weather event or natural disaster depends significantly on the extent to which the resulting property damage is covered by hazard or flood insurance and whether borrowers are able and willing to continue making payments on their mortgages. The amount of losses we incur can also be affected by the extent that a disaster impacts the region, especially if it depresses the local economy, and by the availability of federal, state, or local assistance to borrowers affected by a disaster. To date, our losses from natural disasters have been limited by geographic diversity in our book of business, the availability of insurance coverage for damages sustained and borrowers with equity in their homes continuing to pay their mortgages.\nFor our multifamily loans, our multifamily lenders typically share with us approximately one-third of the credit risk through our DUS program. For single-family and multifamily loans covered in back-end credit risk transfer transactions, we retain a portion of the risk of future losses, including all or a portion of the first loss risk in most transactions. To the extent weather and disaster-related losses on loans covered by these transactions were to exceed the amount of first loss we retain, a portion of those losses would be covered by the transactions. Mortgage insurance does not protect us from default risk for properties that suffer damages not covered by the hazard or flood insurance we require. For more\nTable 382: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>145\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 383: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Risk Management | Climate Change and Natural Disaster Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\ninformation on our single-family credit risk transfer transactions, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions\u201d and for more information on our multifamily credit risk transfer transactions and our DUS program, see Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.\u201d\nIn general, we require borrowers to obtain and maintain property insurance to cover the risk of damage to their property resulting from hazards such as fire, wind and, for properties in areas identified by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas, flooding. At the time of origination, a borrower is required to provide proof of such insurance, and our servicers have the right and the obligation to obtain such insurance, at the borrower's cost, if the borrower allows the required coverage to lapse. We do not generally require property insurance to cover damages from flooding in areas outside a Special Flood Hazard Area, or to cover earthquake damage to single-family properties or to multifamily properties unless required by a seismic-risk assessment.\nIn October 2021, FEMA launched Risk Rating 2.0, which is an actuarial and risk-based approach to pricing flood insurance premiums for properties based on their flood risk, irrespective of whether they are located in a Special Flood Hazard Area. Since October 1, 2021, all new flood insurance policies through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP\u201d) have been subject to Risk Rating 2.0 premiums, and all remaining policies that renew after April 1, 2022 will be subject to the premiums. We expect the majority of households with insurance through the NFIP will experience a premium decrease or a slight increase. However, we expect a small fraction of those households will encounter significant increases in their annual flood insurance premiums. There is a statutory limit of annual increases in flood insurance premiums of 18%, which will mean some households will experience multiple years of increases. As Risk Rating 2.0 becomes applicable to an increasing number of policyholders and premiums increase in the coming years, the significant increase in premiums that will apply to some properties and communities may impact insurance affordability, uptake, and the maintenance of ongoing coverage, as well as property values. As of December 31, 2021, 2.9% of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business and 6.3% of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business were located in a Special Flood Hazard Area, for which we require flood insurance.\nIn the event of a natural or other disaster, our servicers work with affected borrowers to develop a plan that addresses the borrower's specific situation. Depending on the circumstances, the plan may include one or more of the following: a payment forbearance plan; a repayment or reinstatement plan; a payment deferral; loan modification; coordination with insurance companies and administration of insurance proceeds; and, if appropriate, foreclosure alternatives such as short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, or foreclosure. In addition, Fannie Mae's Disaster Response NetworkTM offers renters and single-family borrowers free financial counseling from HUD-approved housing advisors, including help in developing a recovery assessment and action plan, filing claims, working with mortgage servicers, and identifying and navigating sources of federal, state and local assistance. We also have a dedicated team at Fannie Mae focused on coordinating company-wide efforts to support communities affected by natural disasters as they recover. These activities are designed to assist renters and borrowers affected by disasters and thereby help reduce our losses, and we continue to evaluate their impact and seek new options and resources to deploy in response to disasters.\nRecent years have seen frequent and severe natural disasters in the U.S., including hurricanes, wildfires and floods. Population growth and an increase in people living in high-risk areas, such as coastal areas vulnerable to severe storms and flooding, has also increased the impact of these events. Low- and moderate-income and minority households are disproportionately exposed to risks from severe weather events and have limited financial resources to withstand the economic impact.\nThe frequency and intensity of major weather-related events are indicative of climate change, the impacts of which are expected to persist and worsen in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC\u201d), the United Nations' climate science research group, released their Sixth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. The working group that developed the report consisted of over 200 authors from over 50 countries. The report concluded that it was unequivocal that humans have warmed the climate and that many of the changes cannot be undone in our lifetime.\nWe recognize that the increased frequency and intensity of major natural disasters poses risks for all stakeholders in the housing system, including borrowers, renters, lenders, investors, insurers and us. We have a Climate Impact team that is actively working to understand our exposures, identify best practices and strategies to mitigate the impacts such events can have on our guaranty book, sellers, servicers, and borrowers, and increase awareness on this issue. In 2021, we elevated the priority of climate-related issues from an organizational perspective by naming a Chief Climate Officer to identify risks and opportunities while partnering with constituents across the enterprise. We also increased the resources for the Climate Impact team from a staffing and budgeting perspective. Furthermore, we accelerated our focus in analyzing our physical and transition risks, while also reviewing the landscape of modeling approaches (catastrophe vs. climate models) and data needs to improve predictive results. From a mitigation perspective, we are reviewing internal and external policies to identify changes to address rising climate-related risks. Additionally, we are\nTable 384: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>146\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 385: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Risk Management | Climate Change and Natural Disaster Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nexploring climate-related transition scenarios and their applicability to our business. In 2021, raising awareness on issues related to climate risk was a priority for us. We responded to request-for-information opportunities from FHFA and FEMA to share our perspective and highlight areas of focus that we believe regulators and other stakeholders should prioritize. We completed analysis on a nationwide flood survey and, in 2021, produced research and analysis to share our insights and analysis with external stakeholders. Finally, we have maintained our focus on improving our internal risk framework so that it more adequately considers climate-related risks.\nAddressing climate and natural disaster risks will be critical to Fannie Mae Mae's overall housing mission. We are exploring the role we, along with FHFA and others, can play in helping to address some of these risks. For example, we are working with internal and external stakeholders to develop and support climate and natural disaster resiliency standards. Given that improving resiliency of properties will take time, we are also focused on examining insurance requirements to promote financial stability of households impacted by severe weather. One other consideration is the impact of resiliency or energy efficiency standards on affordability. A key challenge will be to appropriately balance improvements on climate resiliency and energy efficiency with affordability, particularly in historically underserved communities. Developing solutions to these challenges is complicated by the range and diversity of affected stakeholders, the possible need for legislative or regulatory action, industry insurance capacity, and the need to balance risk mitigation, affordability and sustainability.\nSee Risk Factors-Credit Risk\u201d for additional information on the risks we face from the occurrence of major natural or other disasters, including additional ways that such events could negatively impact our business, results and liquidity.\nInstitutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management\nOverview\nInstitutional counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of an institutional counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us. Our primary exposure to institutional counterparty credit risk exists with our:\n\u2022credit guarantors, including mortgage insurers, reinsurers and multifamily lenders with risk sharing arrangements;\n\u2022mortgage sellers and servicers;\n\u2022financial institutions that issue investments included in our other investments portfolio; and\n\u2022derivatives counterparties.\nWe routinely enter into a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. We also may have multiple exposures to particular counterparties, as many of our institutional counterparties perform several types of services for us. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways. Our overall objective in managing institutional counterparty credit risk is to maintain individual and portfolio-level counterparty exposures within acceptable ranges based on our risk-based rating system. We achieve this objective through the following:\n\u2022establishment and observance of counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type and level;\n\u2022establishment of risk limits;\n\u2022requiring collateralization of exposures where appropriate; and\n\u2022exposure monitoring and management.\nSee Risk Factors-Credit Risk\u201d for additional discussion of the risks to our business if one or more of our institutional counterparties fails to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.\nEstablishment and Observance of Counterparty Eligibility Standards\nThe institutions with which we do business vary in size, complexity and geographic footprint. Because of this, counterparty eligibility criteria vary depending upon the type and magnitude of the risk exposure incurred. We use a risk-based approach to assess the credit risk of our counterparties through regular examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information. This and other information is used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics that we use to assess credit quality. Factors including corporate or third-party support or guarantees, our knowledge of the counterparty and its management, reputation, quality of operations and experience are also important in determining the initial and continuing eligibility of a counterparty.\nTable 386: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>147\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 387: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstablishment of Risk Limits\nInstitutions are assigned a risk limit to ensure that our risk exposure is maintained at a level appropriate for the institution's credit assessment and the time horizon for the exposure, as well as to diversify exposure so that we adequately manage our concentration risk. A corporate risk limit is first established at the counterparty level for the aggregate of all activity and then is divided among our individual business units. Our business units may further subdivide limits among products or activities.\nCollateralization of Exposures\nWe may require collateral, letters of credit or investment agreements as a condition to approving exposure to a counterparty. Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality and the level of risk exposure of each counterparty. We may require that a counterparty post collateral in the event of an adverse event such as a ratings downgrade. Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.\nExposure Monitoring and Management\nThe risk management functions of the individual business units are responsible for managing the counterparty exposures associated with their activities within risk limits. An oversight team that reports to our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and enforcing corporate policies and procedures regarding counterparties, establishing corporate limits and aggregating and reporting institutional counterparty exposure. We regularly update exposure limits for individual institutions and communicate changes to the relevant business units. We regularly report exposures against the risk limits to the Risk Policy and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors.\nMortgage Insurers\nWe are generally required, pursuant to our charter, to obtain credit enhancements on single-family conventional mortgage loans that we purchase or securitize with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of purchase. We use several types of credit enhancements to manage our single-family mortgage credit risk, including primary and pool mortgage insurance coverage. Our primary exposure associated with mortgage insurers is that they will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims under our insurance policies.\nActions we take to manage this risk include:\n\u2022maintaining financial and operational eligibility requirements that an insurer must meet to become and remain a qualified mortgage insurer;\n\u2022regularly monitoring our exposure to individual mortgage insurers and mortgage insurer credit ratings, including in-depth financial reviews and analyses of the insurers' portfolios and capital adequacy under hypothetical stress scenarios;\n\u2022requiring certification and supporting documentation annually from each mortgage insurer; and\n\u2022performing periodic reviews of mortgage insurers to confirm compliance with eligibility requirements and to evaluate their management, control and underwriting practices.\nThe master policies issued by our primary mortgage insurers govern their claim-paying obligations to us, including circumstances in which significant underwriting or servicing defects might permit the mortgage insurer to rescind coverage or deny a claim. Where a claim has not been properly paid as a result of lender non-compliance with their obligation to maintain coverage, the lender is required to make us whole for losses not covered by the insurer. In recent years, the risk of coverage rescission has been mitigated both by the quality control standards required by private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements ( PMIERs\u201d), which have helped reduce the number of significant underwriting defects, and also by rescission relief principles we require in mortgage insurer master policies. Generally, the rescission relief principles align with our representations and warranties framework and require our primary mortgage insurers to waive their rescission rights after a mortgage has performed for at least 36 months or if they have completed a full review of the loan and found no significant defects. See below for a discussion of the PMIERs.\nIn describing our mortgage insurance coverage, insurance in force\u201d refers to the unpaid principal balance of single-family loans in our conventional guaranty book of business covered under the applicable mortgage insurance policies. Our total mortgage insurance in force was $692.3 billion, or 20% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2021, compared with $675.0 billion, or 21% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2020.\nRisk in force\u201d refers to the maximum potential loss recovery under the applicable mortgage insurance policies in force and is generally based on the loan-level insurance coverage percentage and, if applicable, any aggregate pool loss limit, as specified in the policy. As of December 31, 2021, our total mortgage insurance risk in force was $176.8 billion,\nTable 388: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>148\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 389: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nor 5% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, compared with $171.2 billion, or 5% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2020.\nOur total mortgage insurance in force and risk in force excludes insurance coverage provided by federal government entities and credit insurance obtained through CIRT deals.\nThe charts below display our mortgage insurer counterparties that provided approximately 10% or more of the risk-in-force mortgage insurance coverage on the single-family loans in our conventional guaranty book of business.\nMortgage Insurer Concentration(1)\nTable 390: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Arch Capital Group Ltd. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Radian Guaranty, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corp. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Essent Guaranty, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>National Mortgage Insurance Corp. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Others </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Insurance coverage amounts provided for each counterparty may include coverage provided by affiliates and subsidiaries of the counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2021, and 2020, 1% of our total risk-in-force coverage was held with three mortgage insurers that are in run-off, and therefore are no longer approved to write new insurance with us. See Risk Factors-Credit Risk\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our business of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all, including the risks associated with our three mortgage insurance counterparties that are in run-off.\nMortgage insurers must meet and maintain compliance with PMIERs to be eligible to write mortgage insurance on loans acquired by Fannie Mae. The PMIERs are designed to ensure that mortgage insurers have sufficient liquid assets to pay all claims under a hypothetical future stress scenario.\nReinsurers\nWe use CIRT deals to transfer credit risk on a pool of loans to an insurance provider that retains the risk, or to an insurance provider that simultaneously cedes all of its risk to one or more reinsurers. In CIRT transactions, we select the insurance providers and approve the allocation of coverage that may be simultaneously transferred to reinsurers by a direct provider of our CIRT insurance coverage. We take certain steps to increase the likelihood that we will recover on the claims we file with the insurers, including the following:\n\u2022In our approval and selection of CIRT insurers and reinsurers, we take into account the financial strength of those companies and the concentration risk that we have with those counterparties.\n\u2022We monitor the financial strength of CIRT insurers and reinsurers to confirm compliance with our requirements and to minimize potential exposure. Changes in the financial strength of an insurer or reinsurer may impact our future allocation of new CIRT insurance coverage to those providers. In addition, a material deterioration of the financial strength of a CIRT insurer or reinsurer may permit us to terminate existing CIRT coverage pursuant to terms of the CIRT insurance policy.\n\u2022We require a portion of the insurers' or reinsurers' obligations in a CIRT transaction to be collateralized with highly-rated liquid assets held in a trust account. The required amount of collateral is initially determined\nTable 391: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>149\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 392: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\naccording to the ratings of the insurer or reinsurer. Contractual provisions require additional collateral to be posted in the event of adverse developments with the counterparty, such as a ratings downgrade.\nThe charts below display the concentration of our credit risk exposure to our top five CIRT counterparties, measured by maximum liability to us, excluding the benefit of collateral we hold to secure the counterparties' obligations.\nCIRT Counterparty Concentration\nTable 393: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Top 5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Others </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, our CIRT counterparties had a maximum liability to us of $12.6 billion.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, $3.6 billion in liquid assets securing CIRT counterparties' obligations were held in trust accounts.\n\u2022Our top five CIRT counterparties had a maximum liability to us of $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nFor information on our credit risk transfer transactions, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.\u201d\nMultifamily Lenders with Risk Sharing\nWe enter into risk sharing agreements with multifamily lenders, primarily through the DUS program, pursuant to which the lenders agree to bear all or some portion of the credit losses on the covered loans. Our maximum potential loss recovery from lenders under risk sharing agreements on multifamily loans was $97.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $92.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, 52% of our maximum potential loss recovery on multifamily loans was from five DUS lenders as compared with 51% as of December 31, 2020.\nAs noted above in Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk,\u201d our primary multifamily delivery channel is our DUS program, which is composed of lenders that range from large depositories to independent non-bank financial institutions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of the unpaid principal balance of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business serviced by our DUS lenders was from institutions with an external investment grade credit rating or a guaranty from an affiliate with an external investment grade credit rating, compared with approximately 35% as of December 31, 2020. Given the recourse nature of the DUS program, DUS lenders are bound by eligibility standards that dictate, among other items, minimum capital and liquidity levels, and the posting of collateral at a highly rated custodian to secure a portion of the lenders' future obligations. We actively monitor the financial condition of these lenders to help ensure the level of risk remains within our standards and to ensure required capital levels are maintained and are in alignment with actual and modeled loss projections.\nTable 394: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>150\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 395: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMortgage Servicers and Sellers\nMortgage Servicers\nThe primary risk associated with mortgage servicers that service the loans in our guaranty book of business is that they will fail to fulfill their servicing obligations. See Single-Family Business-Single-Family Primary Business Activities-Single-Family Mortgage Servicing\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Primary Business Activities-Multifamily Mortgage Servicing\u201d for more discussion on the services performed by our mortgage servicers.\nA servicing contract breach could result in credit losses for us or could cause us to incur the cost of finding a replacement servicer. We likely would incur costs and potential increases in servicing fees and could also face operational risks if we replace a mortgage servicer. If a mortgage servicer defaults, it could result in a temporary disruption in servicing and loss mitigation activities relating to the loans serviced by that mortgage servicer, particularly if there is a loss of experienced servicing personnel. See Risk Factors-Credit Risk\u201d for a discussion of additional risks to our business and financial results associated with mortgage servicers.\nWe mitigate these risks in several ways, including:\n\u2022establishing minimum standards and financial requirements for our servicers;\n\u2022monitoring financial and portfolio performance as compared with peers and internal benchmarks; and\n\u2022for our largest mortgage servicers, conducting periodic financial reviews to confirm compliance with servicing guidelines and servicing performance expectations.\nWe may take one or more of the following actions to mitigate our credit exposure to mortgage servicers that present a higher risk:\n\u2022require a guaranty of obligations by higher-rated entities;\n\u2022transfer exposure to third parties;\n\u2022require collateral;\n\u2022establish more stringent financial requirements;\n\u2022work with underperforming major servicers to improve operational processes; and\n\u2022suspend or terminate the selling and servicing relationship if deemed necessary.\nA large portion of our single-family guaranty book is serviced by non-depository servicers, particularly our delinquent single-family loans. Compared with depository financial institutions, these institutions pose additional risks to us because they may not have the same financial strength or operational capacity, or be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight, as our largest mortgage servicer counterparties, which are mostly depository institutions. Unlike for depository servicers, much of the capital of non-depository servicers is represented by the value of mortgage servicing rights, which is subject to variability based on market conditions and therefore is an important factor in determining capital adequacy. We require single-family non-depository servicers to meet minimum liquidity requirements to maintain eligibility with Fannie Mae. We actively monitor the financial condition and capital adequacy of these non-depository servicers, including their compliance with our requirements.\nIn June 2020, FHFA announced that it would re-propose the minimum financial eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sellers and servicers due to market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, FHFA issued its re-proposal which, if adopted as proposed, may increase capital and liquidity requirements for our single family non-depository sellers and servicers.\nTable 396: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>151\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 397: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe charts below display the percentage of our single-family guaranty book of business serviced by our top five depository single-family mortgage servicers and top five non-depository single-family mortgage servicers.\nSingle-Family Mortgage Servicer Concentration\nTable 398: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Top 5 depository servicers </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Top 5 non-depository servicers </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Others </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., together with its affiliates, serviced approximately 10% of our single-family guaranty book of business, compared with 13% as of December 31, 2020.\nThe charts below display the percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business serviced by our top five multifamily mortgage servicers.\nMultifamily Mortgage Servicer Concentration\nTable 399: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Top 5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Others </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Walker & Dunlop, LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., together with its affiliates, each serviced over 10% of our multifamily guaranty book of business.\nCounterparty Credit Exposure of Investments Held in our Other Investments Portfolio\nThe primary credit exposure associated with investments held in our other investments portfolio is that issuers will not repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms. If one of these counterparties fails to meet its obligations to us under the terms of the investments, it could result in financial losses to us and have a material adverse\nTable 400: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>152\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\neffect on our earnings, liquidity, financial condition and net worth. We believe the risk of default is low because our other investments portfolio consists of instruments broadly traded in the financial markets, including cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased under agreements to resell or similar arrangements and U.S. Treasury securities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our other investments portfolio totaled $133.2 billion and included $83.6 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2020, our other investments portfolio totaled $197.0 billion and included $130.5 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. We mitigate our risk by monitoring the credit risk position of our other investments portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, we held $7.7 billion in overnight unsecured deposits with four financial institutions, compared with $8.1 billion held with four financial institutions as of December 31, 2020. The short-term credit ratings for each of these financial institutions by S&P, Moody's and Fitch were at least A-1 or the Moody's or Fitch equivalent of A-1.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Other Investments Portfolio\u201d for more information on our other investments portfolio.\nDerivative Counterparty Credit Exposure\nThe primary credit exposure that we have on a derivative transaction is that a counterparty will default on payments due, which could result in us having to acquire a replacement derivative from a different counterparty at a higher cost or we may be unable to find a suitable replacement. Our derivative counterparty credit exposure relates principally to interest-rate derivative contracts.\nHistorically, our risk management derivative transactions have been made pursuant to bilateral contracts with a specific counterparty governed by the terms of an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. master agreement. Pursuant to regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit certain categories of interest-rate swaps to a derivatives clearing organization. We refer to our derivative transactions made pursuant to bilateral contracts as our OTC derivative transactions and our derivative transactions accepted for clearing by a derivatives clearing organization as our cleared derivative transactions.\nActions we take to manage our derivative counterparty credit exposure relating to our OTC derivative transactions include:\n\u2022entering into enforceable master netting arrangements with these counterparties, which allow us to net derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty; and\n\u2022requiring counterparties to post collateral, which includes cash, U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt and agency mortgage-related securities.\nWe manage our credit exposure relating to our cleared derivative transactions through enforceable master netting arrangements. These arrangements allow us to net our exposure to cleared derivatives by clearing organization and by clearing member.\nOur cleared derivative transactions are submitted to a derivatives clearing organization on our behalf through a clearing member of the organization. A contract accepted by a derivatives clearing organization is governed by the terms of the clearing organization's rules and arrangements between us and the clearing member of the clearing organization. As a result, we are exposed to the institutional credit risk of both the derivatives clearing organization and the member who is acting on our behalf.\nWe estimate our exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments by calculating the replacement cost, on a present value basis, to settle at current market prices all outstanding derivative contracts in a net gain position at the counterparty level where the right of legal offset exists.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had twelve counterparties with which we may transact OTC derivative transactions, all of which were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, compared with thirteen counterparties as of December 31, 2020. We had outstanding notional amounts with all of these OTC counterparties, and the highest concentration by total outstanding notional amount was approximately 6% as of December 31, 2021 compared with 4% as of December 31, 2020, measured based on all derivatives outstanding.\nTotal exposure represents our exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments less the cash and non-cash collateral posted by our counterparties to us. This does not include collateral held in excess of exposure. Our total exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2021 and $179 million as of December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d and Note 14, Netting Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our derivative contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 402: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>153\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Counterparties\nCounterparty Credit Risk Exposure Arising from the Resecuritization of Freddie Mac-Issued Securities\nWe have been resecuritizing Freddie Mac-issued securities since June 2019 when we began issuing UMBS, which has increased our credit risk exposure and operational risk exposure to Freddie Mac, and our risk exposure to Freddie Mac is expected to increase as we issue more structured securities backed by Freddie Mac securities going forward. In the event Freddie Mac were to fail (for credit or operational reasons) to make a payment on a payment date on Freddie Mac securities that we had resecuritized in a Fannie Mae-issued structured security, we would be responsible for making the entire payment on the Freddie Mac securities included in that structured security in order to make payments on any of our outstanding single-family Fannie Mae MBS to be paid on that payment date. Accordingly, as the amount of structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities grows, if Freddie Mac were to fail to meet its obligations to us under the terms of these securities, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. We believe the risk of default by Freddie Mac is negligible because of the funding commitment available to Freddie Mac through its senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $212.3 billion in Freddie Mac securities were backing Fannie Mae-issued structured securities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $137.3 billion in Freddie Mac securities were backing Fannie Mae-issued structured securities. See Business-Mortgage Securitizations-Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities, or UMBS\u201d and Risk Factors-GSE and Conservatorship Risk\u201d for more information on risks associated with our issuance of UMBS.\nCentral Counterparty Clearing Institutions\nFannie Mae is a clearing member of two divisions of Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ( FICC\u201d), a central counterparty ( CCP\u201d). One FICC division clears our trades involving securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other non-mortgage related securities. The other division clears our forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-related securities, including dollar roll transactions. As a result of these trades, we are required to post initial and variation margin payments and are exposed to the risk that FICC fails to perform. As a clearing member of FICC, we are exposed to the risk that the CCP or one or more of the CCP's clearing members fails to perform its obligations as described below.\n\u2022A default by or the financial or operational failure of FICC would require us to replace contracts cleared through FICC, thereby increasing operational costs and potentially resulting in losses.\n\u2022We may also be exposed to losses if a clearing member of FICC defaults on its obligations as each clearing member is required to absorb a portion of those fellow-clearing member losses. As a result, we could lose the margin that we have posted to FICC. Moreover, our exposure could exceed the amount of margin that we previously posted to FICC, since FICC's rules require non-defaulting clearing members to cover, on a pro rata basis, losses caused by a clearing member's default.\nWe are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make to FICC under these arrangements as our exposure is dependent on the volume of trades FICC clearing members execute now and in the future, which varies daily. Although we are unable to develop an estimate of our maximum exposure, we expect that losses caused by any clearing member would be partially offset by the fair value of margin posted by the defaulting clearing member and any other available assets of the CCP for those purposes. We believe that the risk of loss is remote due to the FICC's initial and daily mark-to-market margin requirements, guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of a default.\nWe actively monitor the risks associated with the FICC in order to effectively manage this counterparty risk and our associated liquidity exposure\nCustodial Depository Institutions\nOur mortgage servicer counterparties are required by our Servicing Guide to use custodial depository institutions to hold remittances of borrower payments of principal and interest on our behalf. If a custodial depository institution were to fail while holding such remittances, we would be exposed to risk for balances in excess of the deposit insurance protection and might not be able to recover all of the principal and interest payments being held by the depository on our behalf, or there might be a substantial delay in receiving these amounts. If this were to occur, we would be required to replace these amounts with our own funds to make payments that are due to Fannie Mae MBS certificateholders. Accordingly, the insolvency of one of our principal custodial depository institutions could result in significant financial losses to us. To mitigate these risks, our Servicing Guide requires our mortgage servicer counterparties to use custodial depository institutions that are insured, that are rated as well capitalized\u201d by their regulator and that meet certain minimum financial ratings from third-party agencies.\nTable 404: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>154\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 405: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMortgage Originators, Investors and Dealers\nWe are routinely exposed to pre-settlement risk through the purchase or sale of mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities with mortgage originators, mortgage investors and mortgage dealers. The risk is the possibility that the counterparty will be unable or unwilling to either deliver mortgage assets or compensate us for the cost to cancel or replace the transaction. We manage this risk by determining position limits with these counterparties, based upon our assessment of their creditworthiness, and by monitoring and managing these exposures.\nDebt Security Dealers\nThe credit risk associated with dealers that commit to place our debt securities is that they will fail to honor their contracts to take delivery of the debt, which could result in delayed issuance of the debt through another dealer. We manage these risks by establishing approval standards, monitoring our exposure positions and monitoring changes in the credit quality of dealers.\nDocument Custodians\nWe use third-party document custodians to provide loan document certification and custody services for some of the loans that we purchase and securitize. In many cases, our lenders or their affiliates also serve as document custodians for us. Our ownership rights to the mortgage loans that we own or that back our Fannie Mae MBS could be challenged if a lender intentionally or negligently pledges or sells the loans that we purchased or fails to obtain a release of prior liens on the loans that we purchased, which could result in financial losses to us. When a lender or one of its affiliates acts as a document custodian for us, the risk that our ownership interest in the loans may be adversely affected is increased, particularly in the event the lender were to become insolvent. We mitigate these risks through legal and contractual arrangements with these custodians that identify our ownership interest, as well as by establishing qualifying standards for document custodians and requiring removal of the documents to our possession or to an independent third-party document custodian if we have concerns about the solvency or competency of the document custodian.\nThe MERS System\nThe MERS\u00ae System is an electronic registry owned by Intercontinental Exchange that is widely used by participants in the mortgage finance industry to track servicing rights and ownership of loans in the United States. A large portion of the loans we own or guarantee are registered and tracked in the MERS System. Though we believe it is unlikely, if we are unable to use the MERS System, or if our use of the MERS System adversely affects our ability to enforce our rights with respect to our loans registered and tracked in the MERS System, it could create operational and legal risks for us and increase the costs and time it takes to record loans or foreclose on loans.\nMarket Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management\nWe are subject to market risk, which includes interest-rate risk and spread risk. These risks arise from our mortgage asset investments. Interest-rate risk is the risk that movements in benchmark interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings. Spread risk represents the change in an instrument's fair value related to factors other than changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nInterest-Rate Risk Management\nOur goal is to manage market risk from our net portfolio to be neutral to movements in interest rates and volatility, subject to model constraints and prevailing market conditions. We employ an integrated interest-rate risk management strategy that allows for informed risk taking within pre-defined corporate risk limits. Decisions regarding our strategy in managing interest-rate risk are based upon our corporate market risk policy and limits that are approved by our Board of Directors.\nWe monitor current market conditions, including the interest-rate environment, to assess the impact of these conditions on individual positions and our interest-rate risk profile. In addition to qualitative factors, we use various quantitative risk metrics in determining the appropriate composition of our retained mortgage portfolio, our investments in non-mortgage securities and relative mix of debt and derivatives positions in order to remain within pre-defined risk tolerance levels that we consider acceptable. We regularly disclose two interest-rate risk metrics that estimate our interest-rate exposure: (1) fair value sensitivity to changes in interest-rate levels and the slope of the yield curve and (2) duration gap.\nThe metrics used to measure our interest-rate exposure are generated using internal models. Our internal models, consistent with standard practice for models used in our industry, require numerous assumptions. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The reliability of our prepayment estimates and interest-rate risk metrics depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the types of securities in our net portfolio, as discussed below. When market conditions change rapidly and dramatically,\nTable 406: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>155\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe assumptions of our models may no longer accurately capture or reflect the changing conditions. On a continuous basis, management makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments indicated by the models. See Risk Factors-Operational Risk\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with our reliance on models to manage risk.\nSources of Interest-Rate Risk Exposure\nWe are exposed to interest-rate risk through our net portfolio,\u201d which we define as our retained mortgage portfolio assets; other investments portfolio; outstanding debt of Fannie Mae used to fund the retained mortgage portfolio assets and other investments portfolio; and mortgage commitments and risk management derivatives.\nWe are also exposed to interest-rate risk in connection with cost basis adjustments related to mortgage assets, mainly single-family and multifamily mortgage loans, held by our consolidated MBS trusts. These cost basis adjustments often result from upfront cash fees exchanged at the time of loan acquisition, which include buy-ups, buy-downs, and loan-level risk-based price adjustments. For single-family loans, borrowers have the option to prepay at any time without penalty before the scheduled maturity date or continue paying until the stated maturity. Given this prepayment option held by the borrower, we are exposed to uncertainty as to when or at what rate prepayments will occur, which affects the length of time our mortgage assets will remain outstanding and the timing of the cash flows related to these assets. This prepayment uncertainty results in a potential mismatch between the timing of receipt of cash flows related to our assets and the timing of payment of cash flows related to our liabilities. Additionally, the timing of when we recognize amortization income related to cost basis adjustments may be affected by prepayments, thereby impacting our earnings. Changes in the timing of income recognition related to cost basis adjustments impact the present value of this income. See Consolidated Results of Operations-Net Interest Income-Analysis of Deferred Amortization Income\u201d for more information on our outstanding net cost basis adjustments related to consolidated MBS trusts.\nChanges in interest rates, as well as other factors, influence mortgage prepayment rates and duration and also affect the value of our mortgage assets. When interest rates decrease, prepayment rates on fixed-rate mortgages generally accelerate because borrowers usually can pay off their existing mortgages and refinance at lower rates. Accelerated prepayment rates have the effect of shortening the duration and average life of the fixed-rate mortgage assets we hold in our net portfolio. In a declining interest-rate environment, existing mortgage assets held in our net portfolio tend to increase in value or price because these mortgages are likely to have higher interest rates than new mortgages, which are being originated at the then-current lower interest rates. Conversely, when interest rates increase, prepayment rates generally slow, which extends the duration and average life of our mortgage assets and results in a decrease in value.\nInterest-Rate Risk Management Strategy\nOur goal for managing the interest-rate risk of our net portfolio is to be neutral to movements in interest rates and volatility. This involves asset selection and structuring of our liabilities to match and offset the interest-rate characteristics of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities. We have actively managed the interest-rate risk of our net portfolio through a strategy incorporating the following principal elements:\n\u2022Debt Instruments. We issue a broad range of both callable and non-callable debt instruments to manage the duration and prepayment risk of expected cash flows of the mortgage assets we own.\n\u2022Derivative Instruments. We supplement our issuance of debt with derivative instruments to further reduce duration and prepayment risks.\n\u2022Monitoring and Active Portfolio Rebalancing. We continually monitor our risk positions and actively rebalance our portfolio of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to maintain a close match between the duration of our assets and liabilities.\n\u2022Fair Value Hedge Accounting. We utilize fair value hedge accounting to align the timing of when we recognize the interest-rate driven fair value changes in hedged mortgage loans and funding debt with derivative hedging instruments to mitigate GAAP earnings exposure to interest-rate changes.\nWe do not currently actively manage or hedge our spread risk, other than through asset monitoring and disposition, or the interest-rate risk arising from cost basis adjustments associated with mortgage assets held by our consolidated MBS trusts. Our spread risk includes the impact of changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and debt (referred to as mortgage-to-debt spreads) after we purchase mortgage assets. For mortgage assets in our portfolio that we intend to hold to maturity to realize the contractual cash flows, we accept period-to-period volatility in our financial performance attributable to changes in mortgage-to-debt spreads that occur after our purchase of mortgage assets. See Risk Factors-Market and Industry Risk\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our business posed by changes in interest rates and changes in spreads and Earnings Exposure to Interest-Rate Risk\u201d below for the impact of market risk on our earnings.\nTable 408: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>156\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 409: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Instruments\nHistorically, the primary tool we have used to fund the purchase of mortgage assets and manage the interest-rate risk implicit in our mortgage assets is the variety of debt instruments we issue. The debt we issue is a mix that typically consists of short- and long-term, non-callable and callable debt. The varied maturities and flexibility of these debt combinations help us in reducing the mismatch of cash flows between assets and liabilities in order to manage the duration risk associated with an investment in long-term fixed-rate assets. Callable debt helps us manage the prepayment risk associated with fixed-rate mortgage assets because the duration of callable debt changes when interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration of mortgage assets. See Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding\u201d for additional information on our debt activity.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments also are an integral part of our strategy in managing interest-rate risk. Derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange. When deciding whether to use derivatives, we consider a number of factors, such as cost, efficiency, the effect on our liquidity and results of operations, and our interest-rate risk management strategy.\nThe derivatives we use for interest-rate risk management purposes fall into these broad categories:\n\u2022Interest-rate swap contracts. An interest-rate swap is a transaction between two parties in which each agrees to exchange, or swap, interest payments. The interest payment amounts are tied to different interest rates or indices for a specified period of time and are generally based on a notional amount of principal. The types of interest-rate swaps we use include pay-fixed swaps, receive-fixed swaps and basis swaps.\n\u2022Interest-rate option contracts. These contracts primarily include pay-fixed swaptions, receive-fixed swaptions, cancellable swaps and interest-rate caps. A swaption is an option contract that allows us or a counterparty to enter into a pay-fixed or receive-fixed swap at some point in the future.\n\u2022Foreign currency swaps. These swaps convert debt that we issue in foreign denominated currencies into U.S. dollars. We enter into foreign currency swaps only to the extent that we hold foreign currency debt.\n\u2022Futures. These are standardized exchange-traded contracts that either obligate a buyer to buy an asset or a seller to sell an asset, in each case at a predetermined date and price. The types of futures contracts we enter into include SOFR and U.S. Treasuries.\nWe use interest-rate swaps, interest-rate options and futures, in combination with our issuance of debt securities, to better match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. We are generally an end-user of derivatives; our principal purpose in using derivatives is to manage our aggregate interest-rate risk profile within prescribed risk parameters. We generally only use derivatives that are relatively liquid and straightforward to value. We use derivatives for four primary purposes:\n\u2022as a substitute for notes and bonds that we issue in the debt markets;\n\u2022to achieve risk management objectives not obtainable with debt market securities;\n\u2022to quickly and efficiently rebalance our portfolio; and\n\u2022to hedge foreign currency exposure.\nDecisions regarding the repositioning of our derivatives portfolio are based upon current assessments of our interest-rate risk profile and economic conditions, including the composition of our retained mortgage portfolio, our investments in non-mortgage securities and relative mix of our debt and derivative positions, the interest-rate environment and expected trends.\nMeasurement of Interest-Rate Risk\nBelow we present two quantitative metrics that provide estimates of our interest-rate risk exposure: (1) fair value sensitivity of our net portfolio to changes in interest-rate levels and slope of yield curve; and (2) duration gap. The metrics presented are calculated using internal models that require standard assumptions regarding interest rates and future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of our securities. These assumptions are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure of the securities and historical prepayment rates experienced at specified interest-rate levels, taking into account current market conditions, the current mortgage rates of our existing outstanding loans, loan age and other factors. On a continuous basis, management makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments and will make adjustments as necessary to properly assess our interest-rate exposure and manage our interest-rate risk. The methodologies used to calculate risk estimates are periodically changed on a prospective basis to reflect improvements in the underlying estimation process.\nTable 410: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>157\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 411: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest-Rate Sensitivity to Changes in Interest-Rate Level and Slope of Yield Curve\nPursuant to a disclosure commitment with FHFA, we disclose on a monthly basis the estimated adverse impact on the fair value of our net portfolio that would result from the following hypothetical situations:\n\u2022 a 50 basis point shift in interest rates; and\n\u2022 a 25 basis point change in the slope of the yield curve.\nIn measuring the estimated impact of changes in the level of interest rates, we assume a parallel shift in all maturities of the U.S. LIBOR interest-rate swap curve.\nIn measuring the estimated impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve, we assume a constant 7-year rate and a shift of 16.7 basis points for the 1-year rate and shorter tenors and an opposite shift of 8.3 basis points for the 30-year rate. Rate shocks for remaining maturity points are interpolated. Our practice is to allow interest rates to go below zero in the downward shock models unless otherwise prevented through contractual floors. We believe the aforementioned interest-rate shocks for our monthly disclosures represent moderate movements in interest rates over a one-month period.\nDuration Gap\nDuration gap measures the price sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in our net portfolio to changes in interest rates by quantifying the difference between the estimated durations of our assets and liabilities. Our duration gap analysis reflects the extent to which the estimated maturity and repricing cash flows for our assets are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios to those of our liabilities. A positive duration gap indicates that the duration of our assets exceeds the duration of our liabilities. We disclose duration gap on a monthly basis under the caption Interest-Rate Risk Disclosures\u201d in our Monthly Summary, which is available on our website and announced in a press release.\nWhile our goal is to reduce the price sensitivity of our net portfolio to movements in interest rates, various factors can contribute to a duration gap that is either positive or negative. For example, changes in the market environment can increase or decrease the price sensitivity of our mortgage assets relative to the price sensitivity of our liabilities because of prepayment uncertainty associated with our assets. In a declining interest-rate environment, prepayment rates tend to accelerate, thereby shortening the duration and average life of the fixed-rate mortgage assets we hold in our net portfolio. Conversely, when interest rates increase, prepayment rates generally slow, which extends the duration and average life of our mortgage assets. Our debt and derivative instrument positions are used to manage the interest-rate sensitivity of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities. As a result, the degree to which the interest-rate sensitivity of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities is offset will be dependent upon, among other factors, the mix of funding and other risk management derivative instruments we use at any given point in time.\nThe market value sensitivities of our net portfolio are a function of both the duration and the convexity of our net portfolio. Duration provides a measure of the price sensitivity of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates while convexity reflects the degree to which the duration of the assets and liabilities in our net portfolio changes in response to a given change in interest rates. We use convexity measures to provide us with information about how quickly and by how much our net portfolio's duration may change in different interest-rate environments. The market value sensitivity of our net portfolio will depend on a number of factors, including the interest-rate environment, modeling assumptions and the composition of assets and liabilities in our net portfolio, which vary over time.\nResults of Interest-Rate Sensitivity Measures\nThe interest-rate risk measures discussed below exclude the impact of changes in the fair value of our guaranty assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates. We exclude our guaranty business from these sensitivity measures based on our current assumption that the guaranty fee income generated from future business activity will largely replace guaranty fee income lost due to mortgage prepayments.\nThe table below displays the pre-tax market value sensitivity of our net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve as measured on the last day of each period presented. The table below also provides the daily average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation values for duration gap and for the most adverse market value impact on the net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe sensitivity measures displayed in the table below, which we disclose on a quarterly basis pursuant to a disclosure commitment with FHFA, are an extension of our monthly sensitivity measures. There are three primary differences between our monthly sensitivity disclosure and the quarterly sensitivity disclosure presented below:\nTable 412: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

reflects the estimated pre-tax impact on the market value of our net portfolio calculated based on a daily average, while the quarterly disclosure reflects the estimated pre-tax impact calculated based on the estimated financial position of our net portfolio and the market environment as of the last business day of the quarter; and\n\u2022the monthly disclosure shows the most adverse pre-tax impact on the market value of our net portfolio from the hypothetical interest-rate shocks, while the quarterly disclosure includes the estimated pre-tax impact of both up and down interest-rate shocks.\nTable 414: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and convexity profile of our net portfolio. Because the effective duration gap of our net portfolio was close to zero years in the periods presented, the convexity exposure was the primary driver of the market value sensitivity of our net portfolio as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the convexity exposure may result in similar market value sensitivities for positive and negative interest-rate shocks of the same magnitude.\nTable 416: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>159\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 417: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use derivatives to help manage the residual interest-rate risk exposure between our assets and liabilities in our net portfolio. Derivatives have enabled us to keep our economic interest-rate risk exposure at consistently low levels in a wide range of interest-rate environments. The table below displays an example of how derivatives impacted the net market value exposure for a 50 basis point parallel interest-rate shock.

Specifically, we have exposure to earnings volatility that is driven by changes in interest rates in two primary areas: our net portfolio and our consolidated MBS trusts. The exposure in the net portfolio is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of risk management derivatives, mortgage commitments, and certain assets, primarily securities, that are carried at fair value. The exposure related to our consolidated MBS trusts relates to changes in our credit loss reserves and to the amortization of cost basis adjustments resulting from changes in interest rates.\nIn January 2021, we began applying fair value hedge accounting to address some of the exposure to interest rates, particularly the earnings volatility related to changes in benchmark interest rates, including LIBOR and SOFR. Although our hedge accounting program is designed to address the volatility of our financial results associated with changes in fair value related to changes in the benchmark interest rates, earnings variability driven by other factors, such as spreads or changes in cost basis amortization recognized in net interest income, remains. In addition, our ability to effectively reduce earnings volatility is dependent upon the volume and type of interest-rate swaps available, which is driven by our interest-rate risk management strategy discussed above. As our range of available interest-rate swaps varies over time, our ability to reduce earnings volatility through hedge accounting may vary as well. When the shape of the yield curve shifts significantly from period to period, hedge accounting may be less effective. In our current program, we establish new hedging relationships daily to provide flexibility in our overall risk management strategy.\nSee Consolidated Results of Operations-Hedge Accounting Impact,\u201d Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional information on our fair value hedge accounting policy and related disclosures.\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management\nSee Liquidity and Capital Management\u201d for a discussion of how we manage liquidity and funding risk.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Our corporate operational risk framework aligns with our Enterprise Risk policy, as well as the COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework, and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and FHFA regulatory guidance. The Operational Risk Management group is responsible for overseeing and monitoring compliance with our operational risk program's requirements. Operational Risk Management works in conjunction with other second line of defense teams, such as Compliance and Ethics, to oversee and aggregate the full range of operational risks, including fraud, resiliency, business interruptions, processing errors, damage to physical assets, workplace safety and employment practices. To quantify our operational risk exposure, we rely on the Basel Standardized Approach, which is based on a percentage of gross income. In addition, where appropriate, we purchase insurance policies to mitigate the impact of operational losses.\nSee Risk Factors-Operational Risk\u201d for more information regarding our operational risk and Risk Management\u201d for more information regarding our governance of operational risk management.\nTable 419: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>160\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 420: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MD&A | Risk Management | Operational Risk Management </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCybersecurity Risk Management\nOur operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners, including proprietary, confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy laws, regulations or contractual obligations. Information security risks for large institutions like us have significantly increased in recent years and from time to time we have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber attacks and other information security threats. These risks are an unavoidable result of being in business, and managing these risks is part of our business activities.\nWe have developed and continue to enhance our cybersecurity risk management program to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against unauthorized attempts to access confidential information or to disrupt or degrade business operations. Our cybersecurity risk management program aligns to the COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and has evolved based on the changing needs of our business, the evolving threat environment and FHFA regulatory guidance. Our cybersecurity risk management program extends to oversight of third parties that could be a source of cybersecurity risk, including lenders that use our systems and third-party service providers. We examine the effectiveness and maturity of our cyber defenses through various means, including internal audits, targeted testing, incident response exercises, maturity assessments and industry benchmarking. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and with other businesses and cybersecurity services in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the environment, enhance our defenses and improve our resiliency against cybersecurity threats. We also have obtained insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity risks. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks. However, recent large-scale cyber attacks suggest that the risk of damaging cyberattacks is increasing. As a result, we anticipate increasing our investments in our cybersecurity infrastructure. For a discussion of our Board of Directors' role in overseeing the company's cybersecurity risk management, see Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Corporate Governance-Risk Management Oversight-Board's Role in Cybersecurity Risk Oversight.\u201d\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our software, computers, systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems and assets, or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, are complex and are often not recognized until launched. In addition, we have discussed and worked with lenders, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties, and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to prevent cyber attacks. See Risk Factors-Operational Risk\u201d for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks to our business.\nModel Risk Management\nOur internal models require numerous assumptions and there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate macroeconomic factors such as home prices, unemployment and interest rates, and their impact on borrower behavior. When market conditions change rapidly and dramatically, the assumptions of our models may no longer accurately capture or reflect the changing conditions. Management periodically makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments indicated by the models. See Risk Factors-Operational Risk\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with our use of models.\nCritical Accounting Estimates Table 421: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. Management has discussed any significant changes in judgments and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with the need for management to make judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies and methods. We have identified one of our accounting estimates, allowance for loan losses, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex\nTable 422: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>161\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 423: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Critical Accounting Estimates </td> </tr>\n</table>\nand inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of single-family and multifamily HFI loan receivables that we expect will not be collected related to loans held by Fannie Mae or by consolidated Fannie Mae MBS trusts. The expected credit losses are deducted from the amortized cost basis of HFI loans to present the net amount expected to be received.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves substantial judgment on a number of matters including the development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, the reversion period applied, the assessment of similar risk characteristics, which determines the historic loss experience used to derive probability of loan default, the valuation of collateral, and the determination of a loan's remaining expected life. Our most significant judgments involved in estimating our allowance for credit losses relate to the macroeconomic data used to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts for key economic drivers, which are subject to significant inherent uncertainty. Most notably, for single-family, the model uses forecasted single-family home prices as well as a range of possible future interest rate environments, which drive prepayment speeds and impact the measurement of the interest-rate concession provided on modified loans. For multifamily, the model uses forecasted rental income and property valuations. For purposes of the macroeconomic sensitivities disclosed below, we have determined that our single-family home price forecast and interest rate forecast are the most significant judgments used in our estimation of credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nQuantitative Component\nWe use a discounted cash flow method to measure expected credit losses on our single-family mortgage loans and an undiscounted loss method to measure expected credit losses on our multifamily mortgage loans. The models use reasonable and supportable forecasts for key macroeconomic drivers.\nOur modeled loan performance is based on our historical experience of loans with similar risk characteristics adjusted to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our historical loss experience and our loan loss estimates capture the possibility of a multitude of events, including remote events that could result in credit losses on loans that are considered low risk. Our credit loss models, including the macroeconomic forecast data used as key inputs, are subject to our model oversight and review processes as well as other established governance and controls.\nQualitative Component, including Management Adjustments\nOur process for measuring expected credit losses for the period is complex and involves significant management judgment, including a reliance on historical loss information and current economic forecasts that may not be representative of credit losses we ultimately realize. Management adjustments may be necessary to take into consideration external factors and current macroeconomic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the data used to derive the model outputs. Qualitative factors and events not previously observed by the models through historical loss experience (such as new or more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus or the effects of economic stimulus) are also considered, as well as the uncertainty of their impact on credit loss estimates. As of December 31, 2020, management applied its judgment and supplemented model results to reflect the continued high degree of uncertainty regarding the future impact of the pandemic and its effect on the economy. As of December 31, 2021, management has removed the remaining non-modeled adjustment as the effects of the government's economic stimulus, the vaccine rollout, and the effectiveness of COVID-19-related loss mitigation strategies were much less uncertain. Additionally, we believe the array of possible future economic environments included in our credit model, which captures scenarios that may be remote, combined with data consumed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as forbearance outcomes, have removed the need to continue to supplement modeled results.\nMacroeconomic Variables and Sensitivities\nOur credit-related income or expense can vary substantially from period to period based on forecasted macroeconomic drivers; primarily home prices and interest rates related to our single-family book of business. We develop regional forecasts for single-family home prices using a multi-path simulation that captures home price projections over a five-year period, which is the period for which we can develop reasonable and supportable forecasts. After the five-year period, the home price forecast reverts to a historical long-term growth rate. Our model projects the range of possible interest rate scenarios over the life of the loan. This process captures multiple possible outcomes of what could be more or less favorable economic environments for the borrower, and therefore will increase or decrease the likelihood of default or prepayment depending on the environment in each path of the simulation.\nTable 424: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>162\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 425: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Critical Accounting Estimates </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below provides information about our most significant key macroeconomic inputs used in determining our single-family allowance for loan losses: forecasted home price growth rates and interest rates. Although the model consumes a wide range of possible regional home price forecasts and interest rate scenarios that take into account inherent uncertainty, the forecasts below represent a mean path of those simulations used in determining the allowance for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2021, and how those forecasts have changed between periods of estimate. Below we present the two succeeding periods used in our estimate of expected credit losses. The forecasts consider periods beyond those presented below. See Key Market Economic Indicators\u201d for additional information about how home prices affect our loan loss estimates, including a discussion of home price appreciation and our home price forecast.

Forecasts for future periods are subject to significant uncertainty, which increases for periods that are further in the future. We provide our most recent forecasts for certain macroeconomic and housing market conditions in Key Market Economic Indicators.\u201d In addition, each month our Economic & Strategic Research group provides its forecast of economic and housing market conditions, which are available in the Research and Insights\u201d section of our website, fanniemae.com.\n(2) These estimates are based on our home price index, which is calculated differently from the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index and therefore results in different percentages for comparable growth. We continually update our home price growth estimates and forecasts as new data become available. As a result, the forecast data in this table may also differ from the forecasted home price growth rate presented in Key Market Economic Indicators,\u201d because that section reflects our most recent forecast as of the filing date of this report, while this table reflects the forecast data we used in estimating credit losses for the periods shown. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic updates to our inputs in our credit loss model from the time they are approved as part of our established governance process, through the date of filing, to ensure the reasonableness of the inputs used to calculate estimated credit losses.\n(3) Forecasted 30-year interest rates represent the mean of possible future interest rate environments that are simulated by our interest rate model and used in the estimation of credit losses. Through the year ending 2021, forecasts represent the average forecasted rate from the quarter-end through the end of December 31, 2021. The fourth quarter of 2021 interest rate represents the 30-year interest rate as of December 31, 2021.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall credit loss estimates, because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or loan types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. Changes in our assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect our estimate of expected credit losses and lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nAs noted above, our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in home prices and interest rate changes. To consider the impact of a hypothetical change in home price appreciation, assuming a one-percent increase in the home price growth rate for the first twelve months of the forecast, on a normalized basis, with all other factors held constant, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately 2%. Conversely, assuming a\nTable 427: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>163\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 428: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Critical Accounting Estimates </td> </tr>\n</table>\none-percent decrease in the home price growth rate for the first twelve months of the forecast, on a normalized basis, the allowance for loan losses would increase by approximately 2%.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical change in 30-year interest rates, assuming a 50-basis point increase in estimated 30-year interest rates, with all other factors held constant, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately 6%. Conversely, assuming a 50-basis point decrease in 30-year interest rates, the allowance for loan losses would decrease by approximately 7%.\nThese sensitivity analyses are hypothetical. In addition, sensitivities for home price and interest rate changes are non-linear. As a result, changes in these estimates are not incrementally proportional. The purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact of home price appreciation and 30-year interest rates on the estimate of the allowance for credit losses. For example, it is not intended to imply management's expectation of future changes in our forecasts or any other variables that may change as a result.\nWe provide more detailed information on our accounting for the allowance for loan losses in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d See Note 4, Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information about our current period benefit (provision) for loan losses, including a discussion of the estimates used in measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our allowance.\nSee Key Market Economic Indicators\u201d for additional information about how home prices affect our loan loss estimates, including a discussion of home price appreciation and our home price forecast.

As a result, Alt-A mortgage loans have a higher risk of default than non-Alt-A mortgage loans. We classify certain loans as Alt-A so that we can discuss our exposure to Alt-A loans in this report and elsewhere. However, there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A loans. In reporting our Alt-A exposure, we have classified mortgage loans as Alt-A if and only if the lenders that delivered the mortgage loans to us classified the loans as Alt-A, based on documentation or other product features. We have loans with some features that are similar to Alt-A mortgage loans that we have not classified as Alt-A because they do not meet our classification criteria. We do not rely solely on our classifications of loans as Alt-A to evaluate the credit risk exposure relating to these loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. For more information about the credit risk characteristics of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,\u201d Note 3, Mortgage Loans.\u201d We have classified private-label mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio as Alt-A if the securities were labeled as such when issued.\nAmortization income\u201d refers to income resulting from the amortization of cost basis adjustments, including premiums and discounts on mortgage loans and securities, as a yield adjustment over the contractual life of the loan or security. These basis adjustments often result from upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level price adjustments or other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized over the contractual life of the loan.\nBusiness volume\u201d refers to the sum in any given period of the unpaid principal balance of: (1) the mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities we purchase for our retained mortgage portfolio; (2) the mortgage loans we securitize into Fannie Mae MBS that are acquired by third parties; and (3) credit enhancements that we provide on our mortgage assets. It excludes mortgage loans we securitize from our portfolio and the purchase of Fannie Mae MBS for our retained mortgage portfolio.\nTable 431: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K\n</td> <td> </td> <td>164\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 432: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>MD&A | Glossary of Terms Used in This Report </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCECL standard\u201d refers to Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and related amendments.\nConnecticut Avenue Securities\u201d or CAS\u201d refers to a type of security that allows Fannie Mae to transfer a portion of the credit risk from loan reference pools, consisting of certain mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business, to third-party investors.\nConnecticut Avenue Securities Credit-Linked Notes\u201d or CAS CLNs\u201d refers to Connecticut Avenue Securities that are structured as securities issued by trusts that do not qualify as REMICs.\nConnecticut Avenue Securities REMICs\u201d or CAS REMICs\u201d refers to Connecticut Avenue Securities that are structured as notes issued by trusts that qualify as REMICs.\nConventional mortgage\u201d refers to a mortgage loan that is not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, such as the VA, the FHA or the Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Program of the Department of Agriculture.\nCredit enhancement\u201d refers to an agreement used to reduce credit risk by requiring collateral, letters of credit, mortgage insurance, corporate guarantees, inclusion in a credit risk transfer transaction reference pool, or other agreements to provide an entity with some assurance that it will be compensated to some degree in the event of a financial loss.\nDesktop Underwriter\u201d or DU\u201d refers to our proprietary automated underwriting system used by mortgage lenders to evaluate the substantial majority of our single-family loan acquisitions.\nDelegated Underwriting and Servicing Program\u201d or DUS Program\u201d refers to our multifamily business program whereby DUS lenders, who must be pre-approved by us, are delegated the authority to underwrite and service loans for delivery to us in accordance with our standards and requirements.\nFHFA\u201d refers to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Through December 31, 2019, loss reserves reflect our estimate of the probable losses we have incurred in our guaranty book of business, including concessions we granted borrowers upon modification of their loans. Since our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, our loss reserves reflect our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses rather than solely incurred losses.\nMortgage assets,\u201d when referring to our assets, refers to both mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio. For purposes of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, the definition of mortgage assets is based on the unpaid principal balance of such assets and does not reflect market valuation adjustments, allowance for loan losses, impairments, unamortized premiums and discounts and the impact of our consolidation of variable interest entities. Our mortgage asset calculation also includes 10% of the notional value of interest-only securities we hold.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read this MD&A together with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and the accompanying notes. This MD&A does not discuss 2019 performance or a comparison of 2019 versus 2020 performance for select areas where we have determined the omitted information is not necessary to understand our current-period financial condition, changes in our financial condition, or our results. The omitted information may be found in our 2020 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021, in MD&A sections titled Consolidated Results of Operations,\u201d Single-Family Business,\u201d Multifamily Business,\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Management.\u201d\nKey Market Economic Indicators\n \nBelow we discuss how varying macroeconomic conditions can influence our financial results across different business and economic environments. Our forecasts and expectations are subject to many uncertainties, including the pace and nature of economic growth, and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations. For example, home price growth could be adversely affected if growth in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) is weaker than we currently expect, if unemployment, particularly among existing homeowners and potential new home buyers, is higher than we expect, or if the housing market is more sensitive to economic and labor-market weaknesses than we expect. For further discussion on housing activity, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Market\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Market.\u201d\nSelected Benchmark Interest Rates\n(1)Refers to the U.S. weekly average fixed-rate mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey\u00ae. These rates are reported using the latest available data for a given period.\n(2)According to Bloomberg.\n(3)Refers to the daily rate per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. SOFR began in April 2018.\nHow Interest Rates Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Net interest income. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly. We amortize various cost basis adjustments over the life of the mortgage loan, including those relating to loan-level price adjustments we receive as upfront fees at the time we acquire single-family loans. As a result, any\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 58 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nprepayment of a loan results in an accelerated realization of those upfront fees as income. Therefore, as loan prepayments slow, the accelerated realization of amortization income also slows. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in the opposite trend of higher net amortization income from cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and related debt.\n\u2022Fair value gains (losses). We have exposure to fair value gains and losses resulting from changes in interest rates, primarily through our mortgage commitment derivatives and risk management derivatives, which we mark to market through earnings. Fair value gains and losses on our mortgage commitment derivatives fluctuate depending on how interest rates and prices move between the time a commitment is opened and when it settles. The net position and composition across the yield curve of our risk management derivatives changes over time. As a result, interest rate changes (increases or decreases) and yield curve changes (parallel, steepening or flattening shifts) will generate varying amounts of fair value gains or losses in a given period.\n\u2022Credit-related income (expense). Increases in mortgage interest rates tend to lengthen the expected lives of our loans, which generally increases the expected impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans. Decreases in mortgage interest rates tend to shorten the expected lives of our loans, which reduces the impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans.\n\u2022In January 2021, we began applying fair value hedge accounting to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, or the interest-rate effect, on our financial results. For additional information on how hedge accounting supports our interest-rate risk management strategy and our fair value hedge accounting policy, see Consolidated Results of Operations-Hedge Accounting Impact,\u201d Risk Management-Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management-Earnings Exposure to Interest-Rate Risk\u201d and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nSingle-Family Annual Home Price Growth Rate(1)\n(1) Calculated internally using property data on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae's home price index is a weighted repeat transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae's home price index excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. Fannie Mae's home price estimates are based on preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data becomes available.\nHow Home Prices Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Actual and forecasted home prices impact our provision or benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Changes in home prices affect the amount of equity that borrowers have in their homes. Borrowers with less equity typically have higher delinquency and default rates.\n\u2022As home prices increase, the severity of losses we incur on defaulted loans that we hold or guarantee decreases because the amount we can recover from the properties securing the loans increases. Declines in home prices increase the losses we incur on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Home prices also impact the growth and size of our guaranty book of business. As home prices rise, the principal balance of loans associated with purchase money mortgages may increase, which affects the size of our book. Additionally, rising home prices can increase the amount of equity borrowers have in their home, which may lead to an increase in origination volumes for cash-out refinance loans with higher principal\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 59 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nbalances than the existing loan. Replacing existing loans with newly acquired cash-out refinances can affect the growth and size of our book.\n\u2022Home price growth in 2021 was 19.0% on a national basis, the highest annual home price growth rate in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index, driven by continued low interest rates and low levels of housing supply relative to the level of demand. Cumulative home price growth for the two-year period ended December 31, 2021 was 31.4%, also the highest in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index. This record home price growth has been a key driver in the growth of our guaranty book of business over that period.\n\u2022The pace of rapid home price growth that we have experienced over the last year is not expected to continue. We expect home price growth to moderate to an annual growth rate of 8.2% in 2022, with slower growth expected thereafter driven by interest-rate increases, inflation and reduced affordability, especially for low- and moderate-income borrowers. As home price growth slows, we expect the amount of positive benefit, if any, to our credit-related income (expense) to moderate as well. Inflation and reduced affordability may present challenges as we pursue our mission to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality affordable rental housing.\nNew Housing Starts(1)\n(1)According to U.S. Census Bureau and subject to revision.\nHow Housing Activity Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Two key aspects of economic activity that can impact supply and demand for housing and thus mortgage lending are the rates of household formation and housing construction.\n\u2022Household formation is a key driver of demand for both single-family and multifamily housing. A newly formed household will either rent or purchase a home. Thus, changes in the pace of household formation can affect prices and credit performance as well as the degree of loss on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Growth of household formation stimulates homebuilding. Homebuilding has typically been a cyclical leader, weakening prior to a slowdown in U.S. economic activity and accelerating prior to a recovery, which contributes to the growth of GDP and employment. However, the housing sector's performance may vary from its historical precedent due to the many uncertainties surrounding future economic or housing policy as well as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages on the economy, and the housing market.\n\u2022With regard to housing construction, a decline in housing starts results in fewer new homes being available for purchase and potentially a lower volume of mortgage originations. Construction activity can also affect credit\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 60 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nlosses through its impact on home prices. If the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply, prices will appreciate and impact the risk profile of newly originated home purchase mortgages, depending on where in the housing cycle the market is. A reduced pace of construction is often associated with a broader economic slowdown and may signal expected increases in delinquency and losses on defaulted loans.\n\u2022We expect a continued lack of inventory for both new and existing homes will likely continue to constrain sales into 2022. However, due to the current strength in housing demand and low supply of homes for sale, we expect single-family housing starts to be higher in 2022 than in 2021, though the pace of new construction continues to be affected by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Despite the constraints on home sales and new construction, we continue to expect housing activity to remain solid into 2022.\nGDP, Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption\n(1)Real GDP growth (decline) and personal consumption growth (decline) are based on the quarterly series calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and are subject to revision.\n(2)According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and subject to revision.\nHow GDP, the Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Changes in GDP, the unemployment rate and personal consumption can affect several mortgage market factors, including the demand for both single-family and multifamily housing and the level of loan delinquencies, which in turn can lead to credit losses.\n\u2022Economic growth is a key factor for the performance of mortgage-related assets. In a growing economy, employment and income are rising, thus allowing existing borrowers to meet payment requirements, existing homeowners to consider purchasing and moving to another home, and renters to consider becoming homeowners. Homebuilding typically increases to meet the rise in demand. Mortgage delinquencies typically fall in an expanding economy, thereby decreasing credit losses.\n\u2022In a slowing economy, employment and income growth slow and housing activity slows as an early indicator of reduced economic activity. Typically, as an economic slowdown intensifies, households reduce their spending. This reduction in consumption then accelerates the slowdown. An economic slowdown can lead to employment losses, impairing the ability of borrowers and renters to meet mortgage and rental payments, thus causing loan\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 61 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \ndelinquencies to rise. Home sales and mortgage originations also typically fall in a slowing economy.\n\u2022The economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued its momentum through 2021, with GDP pushing above its pre-pandemic level by mid-2021 as consumer spending and travel rebounded. The pace and strength of economic expansion remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the continuance of supply chain disruptions and related inflationary pressures, recovery of economic activity outside the U.S., current labor market shortages, the impact of the emergence of new, more infectious variants of the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccination rates.\nSee Risk Factors-Market and Industry Risk\u201d for further discussion of risks to our business and financial results associated with interest rates, home prices, housing activity and economic conditions.\nConsolidated Results of Operations  \nThis section discusses our consolidated results of operations and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\n\n(1)In January 2021, we began applying fair value hedge accounting. For qualifying hedging relationships, fair value changes attributable to movements in the designated benchmark interest rates for hedged mortgage loans and funding debt and the fair value change of the designated portion of the paired interest-rate swaps are recognized in Net interest income.\u201d In prior years, all fair value changes for interest-rate swaps were recognized in Fair value gains (losses), net.\u201d See Hedge Accounting Impact\u201d below and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our hedge accounting program.\n(2)Prior to 2020, Credit enhancement expense was included in Other expenses, net. Consists of costs associated with our freestanding credit enhancements, which primarily include our Connecticut Avenue Securities\u00ae ( CAS\u201d) and CIRT programs, enterprise-paid mortgage insurance ( EPMI\u201d) and certain lender risk-sharing programs. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our change in presentation.\n(3)Includes estimated changes in benefits from our freestanding credit enhancements as well as any realized amounts. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our change in presentation.\n(4)Consists of debt extinguishment gains and losses, housing trust fund expenses, loan subservicing costs, servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities and gains and losses from partnership investments.\nHedge Accounting Impact\nOur earnings can experience volatility due to interest-rate changes and differing accounting treatments that apply to certain financial instruments on our balance sheet. Specifically, we have exposure to earnings volatility that is driven by changes in interest rates in two primary areas: our net portfolio and our consolidated MBS trusts. The exposure in the\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 62 \n MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations \nnet portfolio is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of risk management derivatives, mortgage commitments, and certain assets, primarily securities, that are carried at fair value. The exposure related to our consolidated MBS trusts relates to changes in our credit loss reserves and to the amortization of cost basis adjustments resulting from changes in interest rates.\nTo help address volatility in earnings attributable to interest-rate fluctuations in our net portfolio, we began applying fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 to reduce the current-period impact on our earnings related to changes in interest rates, particularly LIBOR and SOFR. Hedge accounting aligns the timing of when we recognize fair value changes in hedged items attributable to these benchmark interest-rate movements with fair value changes in the hedging instrument.\nUnder our hedge accounting program, we establish fair value hedging relationships between risk management derivatives, specifically interest-rate swaps, and qualifying portfolios of mortgage loans or funding debt. For hedging relationships that are highly effective, we recognize changes in the fair value of the hedged mortgage loans or funding debt attributable to movements in the benchmark interest rate in net interest income. We then offset that impact with the changes in fair value of the designated interest-rate swap. This has the effect of deferring the recognition of gains and losses on the hedging instrument to future periods by recognizing the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item as a cost basis adjustment on the underlying loans or funding debt at the end of the hedge term. The cost basis adjustment is then subsequently amortized back into earnings. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we deferred $1.5 billion in net fair value losses on our hedged loans and funding debt as cost basis adjustments that will be amortized through Net interest income\u201d over the contractual life of the respective hedged items.\nThe impact on Net interest income\u201d and Fair value gains (losses), net\u201d of the application of hedge accounting is presented below in the Net Interest Income\u201d section in the Components of Net Interest Income\u201d table and the Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d section in the Impact of Hedge Accounting on Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d table.\nAlthough hedge accounting reduces earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements in any given period, it does not impact the amount of interest-rate-driven gains or losses we will ultimately recognize through earnings.\nWhile we expect the earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements to continue to be reduced as a result of our adoption of hedge accounting, earnings variability driven by other factors, such as spreads or changes in cost basis amortization recognized in Net interest income,\u201d remains. In addition, our ability to effectively reduce earnings volatility is dependent on having the right mix and volume of interest-rate swaps available. As our portfolio of interest-rate swaps varies over time, our ability to reduce earnings volatility through hedge accounting may vary as well.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional discussion of our fair value hedge accounting policy and related disclosures.\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of net interest income is guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties.\nGuaranty fees consist of two primary components:\n\u2022base guaranty fees that we receive over the life of the loan; and\n\u2022upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level price adjustments and other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized into net interest income as cost basis adjustments over the contractual life of the loan. We refer to this as amortization income.\nWe recognize almost all of our guaranty fee revenue in net interest income because we consolidate the substantial majority of loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets. Guaranty fees from these loans account for the difference between the interest income on loans in consolidated trusts and the interest expense on the debt of consolidated trusts.\nThe timing of when we recognize amortization income can vary based on a number of factors, the most significant of which is a change in mortgage interest rates. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly, which typically results in lower net amortization income. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in higher net amortization income.\nWe also recognize net interest income on the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and our other investments portfolio (collectively, our portfolios\u201d) and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read this MD&A together with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and the accompanying notes. This MD&A does not discuss 2019 performance or a comparison of 2019 versus 2020 performance for select areas where we have determined the omitted information is not necessary to understand our current-period financial condition, changes in our financial condition, or our results. The omitted information may be found in our 2020 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021, in MD&A sections titled Consolidated Results of Operations,\u201d Single-Family Business,\u201d Multifamily Business,\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Management.\u201d\nKey Market Economic Indicators\n \nBelow we discuss how varying macroeconomic conditions can influence our financial results across different business and economic environments. Our forecasts and expectations are subject to many uncertainties, including the pace and nature of economic growth, and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations. For example, home price growth could be adversely affected if growth in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) is weaker than we currently expect, if unemployment, particularly among existing homeowners and potential new home buyers, is higher than we expect, or if the housing market is more sensitive to economic and labor-market weaknesses than we expect. For further discussion on housing activity, see Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Market\u201d and Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Market.\u201d\nSelected Benchmark Interest Rates\n(1)Refers to the U.S. weekly average fixed-rate mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey\u00ae. These rates are reported using the latest available data for a given period.\n(2)According to Bloomberg.\n(3)Refers to the daily rate per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. SOFR began in April 2018.\nHow Interest Rates Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Net interest income. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly. We amortize various cost basis adjustments over the life of the mortgage loan, including those relating to loan-level price adjustments we receive as upfront fees at the time we acquire single-family loans. As a result, any\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 58 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nprepayment of a loan results in an accelerated realization of those upfront fees as income. Therefore, as loan prepayments slow, the accelerated realization of amortization income also slows. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in the opposite trend of higher net amortization income from cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and related debt.\n\u2022Fair value gains (losses). We have exposure to fair value gains and losses resulting from changes in interest rates, primarily through our mortgage commitment derivatives and risk management derivatives, which we mark to market through earnings. Fair value gains and losses on our mortgage commitment derivatives fluctuate depending on how interest rates and prices move between the time a commitment is opened and when it settles. The net position and composition across the yield curve of our risk management derivatives changes over time. As a result, interest rate changes (increases or decreases) and yield curve changes (parallel, steepening or flattening shifts) will generate varying amounts of fair value gains or losses in a given period.\n\u2022Credit-related income (expense). Increases in mortgage interest rates tend to lengthen the expected lives of our loans, which generally increases the expected impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans. Decreases in mortgage interest rates tend to shorten the expected lives of our loans, which reduces the impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans.\n\u2022In January 2021, we began applying fair value hedge accounting to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates, or the interest-rate effect, on our financial results. For additional information on how hedge accounting supports our interest-rate risk management strategy and our fair value hedge accounting policy, see Consolidated Results of Operations-Hedge Accounting Impact,\u201d Risk Management-Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management-Earnings Exposure to Interest-Rate Risk\u201d and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nSingle-Family Annual Home Price Growth Rate(1)\n(1) Calculated internally using property data on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae's home price index is a weighted repeat transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae's home price index excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. Fannie Mae's home price estimates are based on preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data becomes available.\nHow Home Prices Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Actual and forecasted home prices impact our provision or benefit for credit losses.\n\u2022Changes in home prices affect the amount of equity that borrowers have in their homes. Borrowers with less equity typically have higher delinquency and default rates.\n\u2022As home prices increase, the severity of losses we incur on defaulted loans that we hold or guarantee decreases because the amount we can recover from the properties securing the loans increases. Declines in home prices increase the losses we incur on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Home prices also impact the growth and size of our guaranty book of business. As home prices rise, the principal balance of loans associated with purchase money mortgages may increase, which affects the size of our book. Additionally, rising home prices can increase the amount of equity borrowers have in their home, which may lead to an increase in origination volumes for cash-out refinance loans with higher principal\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 59 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nbalances than the existing loan. Replacing existing loans with newly acquired cash-out refinances can affect the growth and size of our book.\n\u2022Home price growth in 2021 was 19.0% on a national basis, the highest annual home price growth rate in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index, driven by continued low interest rates and low levels of housing supply relative to the level of demand. Cumulative home price growth for the two-year period ended December 31, 2021 was 31.4%, also the highest in the history of the Fannie Mae national home price index. This record home price growth has been a key driver in the growth of our guaranty book of business over that period.\n\u2022The pace of rapid home price growth that we have experienced over the last year is not expected to continue. We expect home price growth to moderate to an annual growth rate of 8.2% in 2022, with slower growth expected thereafter driven by interest-rate increases, inflation and reduced affordability, especially for low- and moderate-income borrowers. As home price growth slows, we expect the amount of positive benefit, if any, to our credit-related income (expense) to moderate as well. Inflation and reduced affordability may present challenges as we pursue our mission to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality affordable rental housing.\nNew Housing Starts(1)\n(1)According to U.S. Census Bureau and subject to revision.\nHow Housing Activity Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Two key aspects of economic activity that can impact supply and demand for housing and thus mortgage lending are the rates of household formation and housing construction.\n\u2022Household formation is a key driver of demand for both single-family and multifamily housing. A newly formed household will either rent or purchase a home. Thus, changes in the pace of household formation can affect prices and credit performance as well as the degree of loss on defaulted loans.\n\u2022Growth of household formation stimulates homebuilding. Homebuilding has typically been a cyclical leader, weakening prior to a slowdown in U.S. economic activity and accelerating prior to a recovery, which contributes to the growth of GDP and employment. However, the housing sector's performance may vary from its historical precedent due to the many uncertainties surrounding future economic or housing policy as well as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages on the economy, and the housing market.\n\u2022With regard to housing construction, a decline in housing starts results in fewer new homes being available for purchase and potentially a lower volume of mortgage originations. Construction activity can also affect credit\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 60 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \nlosses through its impact on home prices. If the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply, prices will appreciate and impact the risk profile of newly originated home purchase mortgages, depending on where in the housing cycle the market is. A reduced pace of construction is often associated with a broader economic slowdown and may signal expected increases in delinquency and losses on defaulted loans.\n\u2022We expect a continued lack of inventory for both new and existing homes will likely continue to constrain sales into 2022. However, due to the current strength in housing demand and low supply of homes for sale, we expect single-family housing starts to be higher in 2022 than in 2021, though the pace of new construction continues to be affected by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Despite the constraints on home sales and new construction, we continue to expect housing activity to remain solid into 2022.\nGDP, Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption\n(1)Real GDP growth (decline) and personal consumption growth (decline) are based on the quarterly series calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and are subject to revision.\n(2)According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and subject to revision.\nHow GDP, the Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption Can Affect Our Financial Results\n\u2022Changes in GDP, the unemployment rate and personal consumption can affect several mortgage market factors, including the demand for both single-family and multifamily housing and the level of loan delinquencies, which in turn can lead to credit losses.\n\u2022Economic growth is a key factor for the performance of mortgage-related assets. In a growing economy, employment and income are rising, thus allowing existing borrowers to meet payment requirements, existing homeowners to consider purchasing and moving to another home, and renters to consider becoming homeowners. Homebuilding typically increases to meet the rise in demand. Mortgage delinquencies typically fall in an expanding economy, thereby decreasing credit losses.\n\u2022In a slowing economy, employment and income growth slow and housing activity slows as an early indicator of reduced economic activity. Typically, as an economic slowdown intensifies, households reduce their spending. This reduction in consumption then accelerates the slowdown. An economic slowdown can lead to employment losses, impairing the ability of borrowers and renters to meet mortgage and rental payments, thus causing loan\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 61 \n MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators \ndelinquencies to rise. Home sales and mortgage originations also typically fall in a slowing economy.\n\u2022The economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued its momentum through 2021, with GDP pushing above its pre-pandemic level by mid-2021 as consumer spending and travel rebounded. The pace and strength of economic expansion remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the continuance of supply chain disruptions and related inflationary pressures, recovery of economic activity outside the U.S., current labor market shortages, the impact of the emergence of new, more infectious variants of the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccination rates.\nSee Risk

For qualifying hedging relationships, fair value changes attributable to movements in the designated benchmark interest rates for hedged mortgage loans and funding debt and the fair value change of the designated portion of the paired interest-rate swaps are recognized in Net interest income.\u201d In prior years, all fair value changes for interest-rate swaps were recognized in Fair value gains (losses), net.\u201d See Hedge Accounting Impact\u201d below and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our hedge accounting program.\n(2)Prior to 2020, Credit enhancement expense was included in Other expenses, net. Consists of costs associated with our freestanding credit enhancements, which primarily include our Connecticut Avenue Securities\u00ae ( CAS\u201d) and CIRT programs, enterprise-paid mortgage insurance ( EPMI\u201d) and certain lender risk-sharing programs. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our change in presentation.\n(3)Includes estimated changes in benefits from our freestanding credit enhancements as well as any realized amounts. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information about our change in presentation.\n(4)Consists of debt extinguishment gains and losses, housing trust fund expenses, loan subservicing costs, servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities and gains and losses from partnership investments.\nHedge Accounting Impact\nOur earnings can experience volatility due to interest-rate changes and differing accounting treatments that apply to certain financial instruments on our balance sheet. Specifically, we have exposure to earnings volatility that is driven by changes in interest rates in two primary areas: our net portfolio and our consolidated MBS trusts. The exposure in the\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 62 \n MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations \nnet portfolio is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of risk management derivatives, mortgage commitments, and certain assets, primarily securities, that are carried at fair value. The exposure related to our consolidated MBS trusts relates to changes in our credit loss reserves and to the amortization of cost basis adjustments resulting from changes in interest rates.\nTo help address volatility in earnings attributable to interest-rate fluctuations in our net portfolio, we began applying fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 to reduce the current-period impact on our earnings related to changes in interest rates, particularly LIBOR and SOFR. Hedge accounting aligns the timing of when we recognize fair value changes in hedged items attributable to these benchmark interest-rate movements with fair value changes in the hedging instrument.\nUnder our hedge accounting program, we establish fair value hedging relationships between risk management derivatives, specifically interest-rate swaps, and qualifying portfolios of mortgage loans or funding debt. For hedging relationships that are highly effective, we recognize changes in the fair value of the hedged mortgage loans or funding debt attributable to movements in the benchmark interest rate in net interest income. We then offset that impact with the changes in fair value of the designated interest-rate swap. This has the effect of deferring the recognition of gains and losses on the hedging instrument to future periods by recognizing the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item as a cost basis adjustment on the underlying loans or funding debt at the end of the hedge term. The cost basis adjustment is then subsequently amortized back into earnings. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we deferred $1.5 billion in net fair value losses on our hedged loans and funding debt as cost basis adjustments that will be amortized through Net interest income\u201d over the contractual life of the respective hedged items.\nThe impact on Net interest income\u201d and Fair value gains (losses), net\u201d of the application of hedge accounting is presented below in the Net Interest Income\u201d section in the Components of Net Interest Income\u201d table and the Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d section in the Impact of Hedge Accounting on Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net\u201d table.\nAlthough hedge accounting reduces earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements in any given period, it does not impact the amount of interest-rate-driven gains or losses we will ultimately recognize through earnings.\nWhile we expect the earnings volatility related to benchmark interest-rate movements to continue to be reduced as a result of our adoption of hedge accounting, earnings variability driven by other factors, such as spreads or changes in cost basis amortization recognized in Net interest income,\u201d remains. In addition, our ability to effectively reduce earnings volatility is dependent on having the right mix and volume of interest-rate swaps available. As our portfolio of interest-rate swaps varies over time, our ability to reduce earnings volatility through hedge accounting may vary as well.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8, Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional discussion of our fair value hedge accounting policy and related disclosures.\nNet Interest Income\nOur primary source of net interest income is guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties.\nGuaranty fees consist of two primary components:\n\u2022base guaranty fees that we receive over the life of the loan; and\n\u2022upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level price adjustments and other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized into net interest income as cost basis adjustments over the contractual life of the loan. We refer to this as amortization income.\nWe recognize almost all of our guaranty fee revenue in net interest income because we consolidate the substantial majority of loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets. Guaranty fees from these loans account for the difference between the interest income on loans in consolidated trusts and the interest expense on the debt of consolidated trusts.\nThe timing of when we recognize amortization income can vary based on a number of factors, the most significant of which is a change in mortgage interest rates. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly, which typically results in lower net amortization income. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in higher net amortization income.\nWe also recognize net interest income on the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and our other investments portfolio (collectively, our portfolios\u201d) and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets. See Retained Mortgage Portfolio\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Other Investments Portfolio\u201d for more information about our portfolios.\n Fannie Mae 2021 Form 10-K 63 \n MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations \nSince January 2021, we have recognized fair value changes attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates for mortgage loans and funding debt, and for related interest-rate swaps in hedging relationships, as a component of net interest income, including the amortization of hedge-related basis adjustments on mortgage loans or funding debt and any related interest accrual on the swaps.
