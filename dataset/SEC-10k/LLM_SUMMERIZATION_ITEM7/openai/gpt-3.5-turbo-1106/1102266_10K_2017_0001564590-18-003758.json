Most of our loans are secured by real estate located in Florida.\nOur strategy is to grow organically and by acquisition in our market areas or close to it. In pursuing this strategy, we seek lending teams and companies that are culturally similar to us, that are experienced and are located in our markets or in markets close to us so we can achieve economies of scale. To that end, during 2016, we established a new mortgage line of business led by an experienced mortgage lending team, and an SBA business and intend to grow those business lines in our markets, thus increasing our non-interest income. We also closed two acquisitions in 2016, closed two more acquisitions during the second quarter of 2017, and completed an additional two acquisitions on January 1, 2018.\nOur profitability depends primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income generated from interest-earning assets (i.e. loans and investments) less the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. customer deposits and borrowed funds). Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances. Net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates, deposit flows, and loan demand. Additionally, our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non-interest income and expenses, the provision for credit losses, and the effective tax rate. Non-interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services, and also includes commissions earned on bond sales, brokering single family home loans, Trust services, sale of mutual funds, annuities and other non-traditional and non-insured investments. In December 2017, we sold the trust department which generated a one-time gain of $1,224. Non-interest expense consists of compensation, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and other operating expenses.\nCorrespondent banking division\nThe correspondent banking and capital markets division is integrated with and part of our Bank, although the majority of our bond salesmen, traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. Its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services. The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions located throughout the United States.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors: reviews and evaluation of individual loans, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations, historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans.\nChanges in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses.\nWe use a standardized loan grading system which is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending. Loan officers and portfolio managers assign a loan grade to newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades. Throughout the lending relationship, the loan officer and portfolio manager is responsible for periodic reviews, and if warranted will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and/or analyses. We use a loan grading system of 1 through 7. Grade 1 is\nexcellent\u201d and grade 7 is doubtful.\u201d Loans graded 5 or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to the special asset committee, which includes the Bank's Chief Credit Officer, Director of Credit Administration, Controller, Special Assets Manager and Special Assets officers. Our loan review officers, who are independent of the lending function periodically review loan portfolios and lending relationships. The loan review officer may disagree with the Bank's grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan(s) based on his risk analysis.\nOur Director of Credit Administration ( DCS\u201d) and Special Assets Manager ( SAM\u201d) and their teams are responsible for identifying and reporting all impaired loans, non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructures or TDRs and other real estate owned or OREO. They hold monthly meetings with our Controller and Special Assets Credit Administration ( SACA\u201d) who along with the SAM, is ultimately responsible for preparing the Company's allowance for loan loss calculations each quarter. The Company's CFO and others also attend these meetings periodically. The DCS, SAM and their teams make sure that all non-performing loans subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 310 ( ASC 310\u201d), as well as OREO properties, have a current appraisal (less than one year old) and that the asset is written down to 90% of the current appraisal, or less under certain circumstances, such as a listing price in the case of OREO. The purpose of the meetings is to allow the sharing of information with senior management.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance consists of three components. The first component consists of amounts specifically reserved ( specific allowance\u201d) for specific loans identified as impaired, as defined by ASC 310. Impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan agreement. Each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan, if any. That is to say, a loan may be impaired (i.e. not expected to repay as agreed), but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually, and therefore no specific reserve is warranted.\nThe second component is a general reserve ( general allowance\u201d) on all of the Company's loans other than those identified as impaired. We group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors, as well as for certain loan grading factors.\nThe third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit-impaired loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, incorporating assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool's effective interest rate. Impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio. The aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. We have $258 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Other acquired intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible and trust intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. They are initially measured at fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, generally 10 years.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are described further in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences\nresult in an effective tax rate, which differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods. We have a net deferred tax asset of $37.7 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nPurchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI\u201d) Loans\nWe account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method. All identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. We review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements. We consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The Company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value. Thus, an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date. We refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired on a quarterly basis. Losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses. An increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016.\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $55,795 or $0.97 and $0.95 per share basic and diluted, respectively, compared to $42,341 or $0.89 and $0.88 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $13,454 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense.\nNet interest income increased $56,218, or 31% to $235,543 during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $179,325 for the same period in 2016. The increase was the result of a $62,661 increase in interest income and a $6,443 increase in interest expense.\nInterest earning assets averaged $5,631,772 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4,356,455 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1,275,317, or 29%. The yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 4.46% (15 bps to 4.56% tax equivalent basis) during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.33% (4.41% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2016. The combined net effects of the $1,275,317 increase in average interest earning assets and the increase in yields on average interest earning assets resulted in the $62,661 ($64,918 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two years.\nInterest bearing liabilities averaged $3,612,651 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,834,392 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $778,259, or 27%. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased 11 bps to 0.44% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.33% for 2016. The combined net effects of the $778,259 increase in average interest bearing liabilities and the 11 bps increase in cost of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in the $6,443 increase in interest expense between the two years.

Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual, is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change Dec 31, 2017 versus 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,186\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities - taxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities - tax exempt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds sold and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (364\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL INTEREST INCOME (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INTEREST EXPENSE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOW accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INTEREST INCOME (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above details the components of the changes in net interest income for the last two years. For each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volume and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $4 to $4,958 during the year ending December 31, 2017 compared to a provision of $4,962 for the comparable period in 2016. Our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior loan charge-offs. Therefore, the provision for loan losses (Income Statement effect) is a residual of management's determination of allowance for loan losses (Balance Sheet approach). In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers, the historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. Net changes resulting from a mixture of decreases and increases in the Company's various two-year historical loss factors and qualitative factors affected the net change. See credit quality and allowance for loan losses\u201d regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $65,175 compared to $64,369 for the comparable period in 2016.

</tr>\n</table>\nAs shown in the table above, the primary reason for the increase in non-interest income year to year is due an increase in services charges on deposit accounts and gain on sale of the trust department completed in December 2017.\nCorrespondent banking capital markets revenue includes bond sales revenue and brokerage revenue from interest rate swaps and C&I loan sales to correspondent bank clients. The decrease in revenue is mainly due to lower bond sale revenue in 2017. This line of business produced $9,216 of gross revenue during the current year and compared to $14,158 in 2016.\nThe FDIC indemnification asset ( IA\u201d) was producing amortization (versus accretion) due to reductions in the estimated losses in the FDIC covered loan portfolio. To the extent current projected losses in the covered loan portfolio were less than previously projected losses, the related projected reimbursements from the FDIC contemplated in the IA were less, which produced a negative income accretion in non-interest income. This event corresponded to the increase in yields in the FDIC covered loan portfolio, although there was not a perfect correlation. Higher expected cash flows (i.e. less expected future losses) on the loan side of the equation was accreted into interest income over the life of the related loan pool. The lower expected reimbursement from the FDIC was amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the related loan pool(s) or the remaining term of the loss share period. On February 3, 2016, the FDIC bought out our remaining FDIC loss share agreements which resulted in no further FDIC indemnification asset amortization and an increase in non-interest income of $1,070 during the current year compared to 2016.\nThe increase in other non-interest income is in part due to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $12,004, or 6.9%, to $186,485, compared to $174,481for 2016.

FDIC loss share agreements.\nExcluding merger, acquisition and conversion related expenses and loss on termination of FDIC loss share agreements, total non-interest expense increased $27,962 or 19.2% year to year as shown in the above table. The increase is primarily due to our acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recognized an income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $53,480 (an effective tax rate of 48.9%) compared to $21,910 (an effective tax rate of 34.1%) for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the Tax Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, we evaluated our deferred tax asset to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on our deferred tax asset. The lower corporate tax rates resulted in a one-time charge to our deferred tax asset of $18,575 which was booked as additional income tax expense in 2017. Excluding the one-time charge to our deferred tax asset of $18,575, the effective tax rate was 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we implemented ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity, on January 1, 2017 which resulted in excess tax benefits on stock awards of $3,007 during the current year.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015.\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $42,341 or $0.89 and $0.88 per share basic and diluted, respectively, compared to $39,338 or $0.87 and $0.85 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $3,003 was primarily due to the March 2016 acquisitions of Community and Hometown.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense.\nNet interest income increased $24,291, or 16% to $179,325 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $155,034 for the same period in 2015. The increase was the result of a $26,345 increase in interest income and a $2,054 increase in interest expense.\nInterest earning assets averaged $4,356,455 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $3,484,739 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $871,716, or 25%. The yield on average interest earning assets decreased 33 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 4.33% (31bps to 4.41% tax equivalent basis) during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.66% (4.72% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2015. The combined net effects of the $871,716 increase in average interest earning assets and the increase in yields on average interest earning assets resulted in the $26,345 ($27,606 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two years.\nInterest bearing liabilities averaged $2,834,392 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2,278,427 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $555,965, or 24%. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased 1 bps to 0.33% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 0.32% for 2015. The combined net effects of the $555,965 increase in average interest bearing liabilities and the 1 bps increase in cost of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in the $2,054 increase in interest expense between the two years.

Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual, is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change Dec 31, 2016 versus 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities - taxable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,190\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities - tax exempt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (348\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds sold and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL INTEREST INCOME (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INTEREST EXPENSE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOW accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowed funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INTEREST INCOME (tax equivalent basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,376\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above details the components of the changes in net interest income for the last two years. For each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volume and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses increased $469 to $4,962 during the year ending December 31, 2016 compared to a provision of $4,493 for the comparable period in 2015. Our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior loan charge-offs. Therefore, the provision for loan losses (Income Statement effect) is a residual of management's determination of allowance for loan losses (Balance Sheet approach). In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers, the historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. The increase in provision for loan losses is primarily due to the increase in loans outstanding. Net changes resulting from a mixture of decreases and increases in the Company's various two-year historical loss factors and qualitative factors also slightly affected the net change. See credit quality and allowance for loan losses\u201d regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $64,369 compared to $37,450 for the comparable period in 2015.

The increase in revenue in 2016 is mainly due to revenue generated from the facilitation of interest rate swaps for correspondent client banks and their customers. This line of business produced $13,691 of gross revenue during the current year and compared to $7,903 in 2015.\nThe FDIC indemnification asset ( IA\u201d) was producing amortization (versus accretion) due to reductions in the estimated losses in the FDIC covered loan portfolio. To the extent current projected losses in the covered loan portfolio were less than previously projected losses, the related projected reimbursements from the FDIC contemplated in the IA were less, which produced a negative income accretion in non-interest income. This event corresponded to the increase in yields in the FDIC covered loan portfolio, although there was not a perfect correlation. Higher expected cash flows (i.e. less expected future losses) on the loan side of the equation was accreted into interest income over the life of the related loan pool. The lower expected reimbursement from the FDIC was amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the related loan pool(s) or the remaining term of the loss share period. On February 3, 2016, the FDIC bought out our remaining FDIC loss share agreements which resulted in no further FDIC indemnification asset amortization and an increase in non-interest income of $15,397 during the current year compared to 2015.\nOur other FDIC income related line item in the table above, FDIC indemnification income, has two components. The first relates to losses on FDIC covered OREO. To the extent we incurred a loss on the sale of OREO, the FDIC was obligated to reimburse us at various coverage rates pursuant to the applicable loss sharing agreements. The reimbursable amount was recognized as FDIC indemnification income in this line item during the same period the expense or loss on OREO was recognized in our non-interest expenses. The second component relates to provision for loan loss expenses related to impairments on any of our covered loan pools. To the extent we incurred a loan loss provision expense, we recognized FDIC indemnification income pursuant to the applicable coverages outlined in the loss sharing agreements during the same period the expense was recognized in provision for loan loss expense. These reimbursements also ceased effective with our February 3, 2016, FDIC loss share buy-out as described in the preceeding paragraph.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased $3,819 in part due to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016 and new product changes on personal and business accounts during the current year.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $48,399, or 38.4%, to $174,481, compared to $126,082 for 2015.

reimbursable amounts pursuant to FDIC loss share agreements.\nExcluding merger, acquisition and conversion related expenses, expenses related to branch closure and efficiency initiatives and loss on termination of FDIC loss share agreements, total non-interest expense increased $19,072, or 15.2% year to year, as shown in the above table. The increase is primarily due to our acquisitions of Community and Hometown in March 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recognized an income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $21,910 (an effective tax rate of 34.1%) compared to 22,571 (an effective tax rate of 36.5%) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary reason for the decrease was due to a higher percentage of tax exempt interest income relative to total revenue.\nCOMPARISON OF BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016\nOverview\nOur total assets grew by $2,045,416, or 40.3%, from $5,078,559 at December 31, 2016 to $7,123,975 at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nInvestment securities available for sale\nWe have an available for sale securities portfolio which we account for at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of the effect of deferred income taxes.\nWe invest primarily in direct obligations of the United States, obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States, mortgage backed securities, municipal securities and obligations of government sponsored entities and agencies of the United States. The Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank also require equity investments to be maintained by us, which are shown separately in our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur available for sale portfolio totaled $1,060,143 at December 31, 2017 and $740,702 at December 31, 2016, or 15%, respectively, of total assets. See note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a summary of security type, maturity, amortized cost basis, gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses.\nWe use our security portfolio primarily as a tool to manage our balance sheet, manage our regulatory capital ratios, as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. Approximately 92% of investment securities available for sale are mortgage backed securities. The cash flows from these securities are used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position. We classify the majority of our securities as available-for-sale\u201d to provide for greater flexibility to respond to changes in interest rates as well as future liquidity needs. We believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity, without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. The available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized loss of approximately $9,383 (which includes gross unrealized gains of $1,815) at December 31, 2017, compared to a net unrealized loss of approximately $13,958 at December 31, 2016.\nIf our management intends to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, less any current period credit loss, the other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If our management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. The assessment of whether an OTTI decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because we do not have the intent to sell these securities and its more likely than not we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, we do not consider any of our securities, that have an unrealized loss associated with them, to be other than temporarily impaired.\nTrading Securities\nWe also have a trading securities portfolio. For this portfolio, realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of non interest income in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities and are held for short periods of time. This activity was initiated to take advantage of market opportunities, when presented, for short term revenue gains. See note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a summary of purchases, sales and revenue recognized for the year ending December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInvestment securities held to maturity\nDuring 2014, we initiated a held to maturity securities portfolio. At December 31, 2017 the portfolio had securities of $232,399 at amortized cost. We anticipate that this portfolio will generally hold longer term securities for the primary purpose of yield. This classification was chosen to minimize temporary effects on our tangible equity and tangible equity ratio due to increases and decreases in general market interest rates. At December 31, 2017, these securities had gross unrecognized gains of approximately $1,781 and $2,565 of gross unrecognized losses. Similar to our available for sale portfolio, because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because we do not have the intent to sell these securities and its more likely than not we will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, we do not consider any of our securities, that have an unrealized loss associated with them, to be other than temporarily impaired. See note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a summary of security type, maturity, estimated fair value, gross unrecognized gains and gross unrecognized losses.\nLoans\nLending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability. The loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets, and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues. The absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets. Average loans during the year ended December 31, 2017, were $4,326,325, or 77% of average earning assets, as compared to $3,140,343, or 72% of average earning assets, for the year ending December 31, 2016. Total loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $4,773,221 and $3,429,747, respectively, an increase of $1,343,474, or 39%. This also represents a loan to total asset ratio of 67% and 68% and a loan to deposit ratio of 86% and 83%, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn the aggregate, approximately 83% are collateralized by real estate, 15% are commercial non real estate loans and the remaining 2% are consumer and other non real estate loans. The loans collateralized by real estate are further delineated as follows.\nResidential real estate loans: These are single family home loans primarily originated within our local market areas by employee loan officers or acquired pursuant to an acquisition of either an FDIC assisted transaction, a whole bank transaction or an acquisition of branches including selected performing loans (i.e. loans purchased from TD Bank, N.A. in 2011). We do not use loan brokers to originate loans for our own portfolio, nor do we generally acquire loans outside of our geographical markets. The aggregate size of this category is $1,085,278 representing approximately 23% of our total loans. Approximately $59,975 of this total amount is included in our PCI loan portfolio. Of the remaining $1,025,303 that are not PCI loans, approximately $7,107 or 0.7% are non performing (non-accrual) at December 31, 2017.\nCommercial real estate loans: This is the largest category ($2,638,934) of our loan portfolio representing approximately 55% of our total loans. This category, along with commercial non real estate lending, is our primary business. There is no significant concentration by type of property in this category but there is a geographical concentration such that the properties are substantially all located within Florida. The borrowers are a mix of professionals, doctors, lawyers, and other small business owners. Approximately 36% of commercial real estate loans are owner occupied. Approximately $92,791 of total commercial real estate loans are included in our PCI loan portfolio. Of the remaining $2,546,143 that are not PCI loans, approximately $6,549 or 0.3% are non performing (non-accrual) at December 31, 2017.\nLand, development and construction loans: We have no construction or development loans with national builders. We do business with local builders and developers that have typically been long time customers. This category represents approximately 5% ($242,472) of our total loan portfolio. The majority of this amount is land development, lots, and other land loans. Approximately $6,656 of these loans are included in our PCI loan portfolio. Of the remaining $235,816 that are not PCI loans, approximately $138 or 0.1% are non performing (non-accrual) at December 31, 2017.\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities, which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed 25% of total capital.

Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon their maturity. Consequently, management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. See Liquidity and Market Risk Management\u201d for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio.\nCredit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely.\nThe allowance consists of three components. The first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans, as defined by ASC 310. Impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan contract. Each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan, if any. That is to say, a loan may be impaired (i.e. not expected to repay as agreed), but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually, and therefore no specific reserve is warranted.\nThe second component is a general reserve on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over the most recent two years. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. The following portfolio segments have been identified:\nResidential real estate\nCommercial real estate\nConstruction and land development\nCommercial and industrial (not collateralized by real estate)\nConsumer (not collateralized by real estate)\nThe historical loss factors for each portfolio segment is adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors, as well as for certain loan grading factors. The environmental factors that we consider are listed below.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the levels of and trends in past due loans, non-accrual loans and impaired loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans. Also, we consider changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Changes in lending policies, procedures and practices, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.

On a quarterly basis, we update the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, incorporating assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool's effective interest rate. Impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio. The aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses.\nIn the table below we have shown the components, as discussed above, of our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> increase

Net changes resulting from a mixture of decreases and increases in the Company's various two-year historical loss factors and qualitative factors also slightly affected the net change.\nThe general loan loss allowance (non-impaired loans) relating to acquired loans decreased by $599 resulting primarily from a decrease in loans outstanding, excluding the two bank acquisitions (Platinum and Gateway) which occurred during the second quarter of 2017. At December 31, 2017 the non-impaired loans acquired from these two acquisitions were equal to approximately $898,788. These loans were recorded at estimated fair value at acquisition date. As such, there is no allowance for loan losses associated with these loans as of December 31, 2017. The unamortized acquisition date fair value adjustment related to these loans at December 31, 2017 was approximately $8,957, or 1.0% of the related aggregate outstanding loan balances.\nThe specific loan loss allowance (impaired loans) for both originated loans and acquired loans is the aggregate of the results of individual analyses prepared for each one of the impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. Total impaired loans at December 31, 2017 are equal to $20,345 ($16,446 originated impaired loans plus $3,899 acquired impaired loans). The Company recorded partial charge offs in lieu of specific allowance for a number of the impaired loans. The Company's impaired loans have been written down by $1,524 to $20,345 ($19,541 when the $804 specific allowance is considered) from their legal unpaid principal balance outstanding of $21,869. In the aggregate, total impaired loans have been written down to approximately 89% of their legal unpaid principal balance when the related specific allowance is considered and non-performing impaired loans have been written down to approximately 87% of their legal unpaid principal balance when the related specific allowance is considered. The Company's total non-performing loans (non-accrual loans plus loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing, $17,288 at December 31, 2017) have been written down to approximately 87% of their legal unpaid principal balance, when the related specific allowance is also considered.\nApproximately $10,701 of the Company's impaired loans (53%) are accruing performing loans. This group of impaired loans is not included in the Company's non-performing loans or non-performing assets categories.\nPCI loans are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30. PCI loan pools are evaluated for impairment each quarter. If a pool is impaired, an allowance for loan loss is recorded.\nThe allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely. We believe our allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2017. However, we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of the Company's markets and customers, and therefore there is no assurance as to the amount of losses or probable losses which may develop in the future.

We place loans on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days and management believes the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income. Subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status or interest is recognized only to extent received in cash.\nThe largest component of non-performing loans is non-accrual loans, which as of December 31, 2017 totaled $17,288 (144 loans). This amount is further delineated by loan category as follows:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> aggregate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> non-accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> number\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans at 12/31/17\n</td> <td> amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> by category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land, development, construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe other component of non-performing loans are loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing interest. Loans which are past due greater than 90 days are placed on non-accrual status, unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection.\nAt December 31, 2017, total OREO was $3,987 and is included in our non-performing assets ( NPA\u201d). OREO is carried at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell. Further declines in real estate values can affect the market value of these assets. Any further decline in market value beyond its cost basis is recorded as a current expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. OREO is further delineated in the following table.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> carrying amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description of repossessed real estate (OREO)\n</td> <td> at Dec 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 single family homes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9 commercial buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land / various acreages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017 we also had repossessed assets other than real estate with an aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $147.

</tr>\n</table>\nManagement considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be repaid as agreed pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once the loan has been identified as impaired, a written analysis is performed to determine if there is a potential for a loss. If it is probable that a loss may occur, a specific allowance, or a partial charge down, for that particular loan is then recognized. The loan is then placed on non-accrual status and included in non-performing loans. If the analysis indicates that a loss is not probable, then no specific allowance, or partial charge down, is recognized. If the loan is still accruing, it is not included in non-performing loans.\nLoans that are monitored for impairment pursuant to ASC 310 generally include commercial, commercial real estate, land, acquisition & development of land, and construction loans greater than $500,000. Smaller homogeneous loans, such as single family first and second mortgages, consumer loans, and small business and commercial related loans are not generally subject to impairment monitoring pursuant to ASC 310, but are analyzed for potential losses based on historical loss factors, current environmental factors and to some extent loan grading.\nInterest income recognized on impaired loans was approximately $469, $467 and $584 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $19,327, $23,644 and $22,770, respectively.\nWe may restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions. In certain circumstances it may be more beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in a distressed sale. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually reduce the monthly payment and/or interest rate for generally twelve to 24 months. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $12,779 of troubled debt restructures ( TDRs\u201d). Of this amount $11,355 were performing pursuant to their modified terms, and $670 were not performing and have been placed on non-accrual status and included in our non performing loans ( NPLs\u201d). TDRs are included in our impaired loans, whether they are performing or not performing. Only non performing TDRs are included in our NPLs.

interest amounts contractually due, pursuant to its modified terms, are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Our policy also considers the payment history of the borrower, but is not dependent upon a specific number of payments.\nLoans are modified to minimize loan losses when we believe the modification will improve the borrower's financial condition and ability to repay the loan. We typically do not forgive principal. We generally either reduce interest rates or decrease monthly payments for a temporary period of time and those reductions of cash flows are capitalized into the loan balance. We may also extend maturities, convert balloon loans to longer term amortizing loans, or vice versa, or change interest rates between variable and fixed rate. Each borrower and situation is unique and we try to accommodate the borrower and minimize the Company's potential losses. Approximately 84% of our TDRs at December 31, 2017 were current pursuant to their modified terms, and about $2,075, or approximately 16% of our total TDRs are not performing pursuant to their modified terms. There does not appear to be any significant difference in success rates with one type of concession versus another.\nWe are continually analyzing our loan portfolio in an effort to recognize and resolve our problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible. While we believe we use the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses, we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of our markets, and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change. We continuously focus our attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans, as they arise.\nThe table below summarizes our accruing loans past due greater than 30 days and less than 90 days for the periods presented, excluding PCI loans.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> past due loans 30-89 days\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> as percentage of total loans\n</td> <td> 0.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.58%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.62%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.49%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough the total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from all loans, management allocates the allowance among loan portfolio categories for informational and regulatory reporting purposes. Regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based upon the regulators' judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examination, which may differ from our judgments about the allowance for loan losses.\nWhile no portion of the allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is

$141,886 at December 31, 2017 compared to $114,815 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $27,071 or 24%. The primary component of the increase is $33,229 of branch real estate acquired during the second quarter of 2017 with the purchase of Platinum and Gateway. In addition, we transferred $9,605 of branch real estate that is no longer in use to bank properties held for sale at estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell. We recognized an impairment charge of $519 related to these properties resulting in a net transfer to bank properties held for sale of $9,086.

We own 57 and lease 21 of these offices. We also have two loan production offices of which we own 1 and lease 1. In addition to our banking locations, we lease non-banking office space in Winter Haven, Florida for IT and operations purposes. We also lease office space for our Correspondent banking division, primarily in Birmingham, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia and Walnut Creek, California.\nDuring 2017, we transferred $9,086, after an impairment charge of $519, of branch real estate to bank properties held for sale. At December 31, 2017, we have 14 pieces of bank property, of which 4 properties were acquired pursuant to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway, included in our bank property held for sale with an aggregate carrying balance of $11,354.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased $1,407,979, or 34%, to $5,560,523 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $4,152,544 at December 31, 2016. We assumed deposits of approximately $1,228,632 pursuant to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively. Our strategy has been to attract and grow relationships in our core deposit accounts, which we define as non-time deposits, and not aggressively seek deposits based on pricing. Our time deposits represent only 15% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017, compared to 13% at December 31, 2016. In addition, our total checking accounts represent approximately 55% of our total deposits at December 31, 2017. Our cost of deposits, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, was approximately 0.24% during the fourth quarter of 2017.

agreements\u201d) under which we pledge investment securities owned and under our control as collateral against the one-day borrowing arrangement. These arrangements are not transactions with investment bankers or brokerage firms, but rather, with several of our larger commercial customers who periodically have excess cash balances and do not want to keep those balances in non-interest bearing checking accounts. We offer an arrangement through a repurchase agreement whereby balances are transferred from a checking account into a repurchase agreement arrangement on which we will pay a negotiated daily adjustable interest rate generally tied to the federal funds rate.\nThe daily average balance of these short-term borrowing agreements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $43,850, $29,435 and $30,727, respectively. Interest expense for the same periods was approximately $246, $103 and $186, respectively, resulting in an average rate paid of 0.56%, 0.35% and 0.61% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

On March 1, 2016, we assumed $16,000 in corporate debentures from Hometown of which we partially redeemed and terminated $6,000. These corporate debentures were assumed through acquisitions, and as a result, were carried at less than par value at the time of termination.\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost-effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. The rate sensitive position, or gap, is the difference in the volume of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, at a given time interval, including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity. The measurement of our interest rate sensitivity, or gap, is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset/liability management effort. Our Bank generally attempts\nto maintain a range set by policy between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods. The range set by the Bank has been approved by its board of directors. If our Bank falls outside their pre-approved range, it requires board action and board approval, by the Bank's board of directors. The asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables: yield, credit quality, and appropriate funding sources and liquidity. Management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources.\nOur gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals. At December 31, 2017, approximately 57% of total gross loans were adjustable rate. Approximately 83% of our investment securities ($1,071,582 fair value) are invested in U.S. Government Agency mortgage backed securities. Although most of these have maturities in excess of five years, these are amortizing instruments that generate cash flows each month. The duration (average life of expected cash flows) of our securities at December 31, 2017 was approximately 4.1 years. Deposit liabilities, at that date, consisted of approximately $1,058,985 (19%) in NOW accounts, $1,668,954 (30%) in money market accounts and savings, $832,683 (15%) in time deposits and $1,999,901 (36%) in non-interest bearing demand accounts.\nThe table below presents the market risk associated with our financial instruments. In the Rate Sensitivity Analysis\u201d table, rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by repricing periods.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\n</td> <td>\n</td>

It does not include assumptions about sensitivity to changes in various interest rates by asset or liability type, correlation between macro environment market rates and specific product types, lag periods, cash flows or other assumptions and projections. However, in addition to static gap analysis, our Bank also uses simulation models to estimate the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates. Simulation is a better technique than gap analysis because variables are changed for the various rate conditions. Each category's interest change is calculated as rates move up and down. In addition, the repayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed. Rate Shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next 24\nmonths under several rate change levels. These levels span in 100bps increments up and down from the current interest rates. In order to simulate activity, maturing balances are replaced with the new balances at the new rate level, and repricing balances are adjusted to the new rate shock level. The interest is recalculated for each level along with the new average yield. Net interest margin is then calculated and a margin risk profile is developed. The result of these calculations, as of December 31, 2017 looking 24 months into the future, is summarized in the table below.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change in Projected Baseline\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in bps)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-12 Months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13-24 months\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +4.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +11.82%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +3.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +8.23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +1.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +4.47%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -100 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -5.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -9.10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -200 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -11.43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -19.91%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -300 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -13.08%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -22.29%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese models are built on a multitude of assumptions and predictions. The benefit we see is measuring our overall interest rate risk profile. In general, it appears that if market interest rates increase, it suggests a benefit to our net interest income. If market interest rates decrease, it suggests a negative effect on our net interest income. We believe that our interest rate risk is manageable as of December 31, 2017.\nSimulation and rate shock stress testing our net interest income ( NIM\u201d) is a forward looking analysis. That is, it estimates, based on various assumptions, what the effect on our NIM might be given various changes in future interest rates. Another way of analyzing our interest rate risk profile is looking at history. The charts below measure the correlation between our NIM and market interest rates over a 17 year period starting at the beginning of 2000 and ending on December 31, 2017. We used the one and ten year U.S. Treasury rates as surrogates for market interest rates. This simple correlation is not perfect because we ignore changes in duration of our asset/liability portfolio over time and changes in the slope of the yield curve over time, as well as other significant environmental changes that may occur, such as the recent banking crisis. However, it will demonstrate that over time our asset/liability portfolio generally tended to be asset sensitive. That is, in general, over this historical period, when market interest rates increased, our NIM increased, and when market interest rates decreased, our NIM decreased. In the following tables, the U.S. Treasury rates are measured by the vertical bars, and their scale is on the left hand side of the graph. Each bar represents a quarterly average. Our NIM is represented by the line graph and its scale is on the right hand side of the graph. The line graph is connecting a series of dots, which represents our NIM for a given quarter.\nNet Interest Margin vs. U.S. Treasury Rates(1)\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> US Treasury rates obtained from Statistical Releases and Historical Data as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaging interest rate risk is a dynamic process. Our philosophy is to not try to guess the market in either direction. We do not want to be excessively asset sensitive or excessively liability sensitive. We try to manage our asset/liability portfolio with the goal of optimizing our yield without taking on excessive interest rate risk.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on our future obligations. In the table, all deposits with indeterminate maturities, such as demand deposits, checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, are presented as having a maturity of one year or

to $552,457, or 11% of total assets at December 31, 2016. The $352,293 increase was the result of the following items: net income of $55,795, plus $11,704 stock based compensation (including stock options exercised and restricted stock awards), plus $233,731 stock issued pursuant to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway, plus $63,262 stock issued pursuant to a stock offering, plus $2,810 net change in unrealized gains in securities available for sale, less $1,131 in stock repurchases and less $13,878 cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have established risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banks that are applicable to the Company and the Bank. Under these requirements, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain capital standards based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. Adherence to these requirements has not had an adverse impact on our Company. For more information regarding regulatory capital requirements applicable to us, refer to Part I - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation affects financial institutions' increased cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and shareholders' equity. Commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce our earnings from such activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe generally do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than approved and unfunded loans and letters and lines of credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business.\nOur correspondent and capital markets division arranges interest rate swaps between client financial institutions for a fee. Our subsidiary bank also enters into interest rate swaps with certain commercial loan clients. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a fixed rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client's fixed rate loan into a variable rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third party dealer in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 26 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nAccounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1(ai) in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a discussion on the effects of new accounting pronouncements.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides a detailed analysis of the financial condition, organizational structure, acquisitions, and operations of CenterState Bank Corporation and its subsidiary, CenterState Bank, N.A.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes of our Company presented elsewhere herein.\nExecutive Summary\nOrganizational structure\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenterState Bank Corporation (the Parent Company,\u201d Company,\u201d Corporate,\u201d CenterState,\u201d Holding Company\u201d, CSFL\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d), our wholly owned subsidiary bank, CenterState Bank, N.A. ( CSB\u201d or the Bank\u201d), our non bank subsidiary R4ALL, Inc. ( R4ALL\u201d) and our non bank subsidiary CSFL Insurance Corp ( CSFL IC\u201d).\nCenterState, incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on September 20, 1999, is a financial holding company whose principal subsidiary is the Bank. Headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, we provide a full range of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and industries through, as of December 31, 2017, a 78 bank office network located within 28 counties throughout Florida, as well as one loan production office in Florida and one loan production office in Macon, Georgia. CenterState was among the largest Florida-based community banking organizations in terms of publicly available deposit data on a pro forma basis taking into account the closing on January 1, 2018 of its acquisition transactions with HCBF Holding Company, Inc. ( HCBF\u201d) and Sunshine Bancorp, Inc. ( Sunshine\u201d).\nWe also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets service division through our Bank for approximately 600 small and medium sized community banks throughout the United States. Based primarily in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama, this division earns commissions on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities.\nWe have grown from our formation in 2000 primarily through a series of acquisitions, starting in June 2000 through 2016. Our most recent acquisitions include:\n \u2022 Gulfstream Bancshares, Inc., in January 2014, which added approximately $479 million in deposits; \n \u2022 First Southern Bancorp, Inc., in June 2014, which added approximately $853 million in deposits; \n \u2022 Community Bank of South Florida, Inc., in March 2016, which added approximately $453 million in deposits; and \n \n \u2022 Hometown of Homestead Banking Company, in March 2016, which added approximately $253 million in deposits. \u2022 Platinum Bank Holding Company, in April 2017, which added approximately $520 million in deposits. \u2022 Gateway Financial Holdings of Florida, Inc., in May 2017, which added approximately $708 million in deposits. \nOn January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisitions of HCBF, which added approximately $1.8 billion in deposits and $1.3 billion in loans, and of Sunshine, which added approximately $719 million in deposits and $692 million in loans.\nWe also own R4ALL, Inc., which acquires and disposes of troubled assets and CSFL IC, which operates as a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated assets of $7.1 billion, total consolidated loans of $4.8 billion, total consolidated deposits of $5.6 billion, and total consolidated shareholders' equity of $904 million.\nAt the Holding Company level, we perform functions that include strategic planning, merger and acquisition functions, investor relations, capital management, financial reporting, income tax management and reporting, loan review, internal audit, risk assessment and monitoring, and generally oversee and monitor the activities of our Bank. All of the operating activities associated with and related to the commercial and retail banking business, as well as the correspondent banking business, is performed and managed at the Bank.\nA condensed consolidating balance sheet at December 31, 2017 and a condensed consolidating statement of operations for the year ending December 31, 2017 are presented below.\n\n\nThrough our Bank, we conduct commercial and retail banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, construction, development and land loans, and commercial loans and consumer loans. Most of our loans are secured by real estate located in Florida.\nOur strategy is to grow organically and by acquisition in our market areas or close to it. In pursuing this strategy, we seek lending teams and companies that are culturally similar to us, that are experienced and are located in our markets or in markets close to us so we can achieve economies of scale. To that end, during 2016, we established a new mortgage line of business led by an experienced mortgage lending team, and an SBA business and intend to grow those business lines in our markets, thus increasing our non-interest income. We also closed two acquisitions in 2016, closed two more acquisitions during the second quarter of 2017, and completed an additional two acquisitions on January 1, 2018.\nOur profitability depends primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income generated from interest-earning assets (i.e. loans and investments) less the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. customer deposits and borrowed funds). Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances. Net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates, deposit flows, and loan demand. Additionally, our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non-interest income and expenses, the provision for credit losses, and the effective tax rate. Non-interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services, and also includes commissions earned on bond sales, brokering single family home loans, Trust services, sale of mutual funds, annuities and other non-traditional and non-insured investments. In December 2017, we sold the trust department which generated a one-time gain of $1,224. Non-interest expense consists of compensation, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and other operating expenses.\nCorrespondent banking division\nThe correspondent banking and capital markets division is integrated with and part of our Bank, although the majority of our bond salesmen, traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. Its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services. The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions located throughout the United States.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors: reviews and evaluation of individual loans, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations, historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans.\nChanges in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses.\nWe use a standardized loan grading system which is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending. Loan officers and portfolio managers assign a loan grade to newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades. Throughout the lending relationship, the loan officer and portfolio manager is responsible for periodic reviews, and if warranted will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and/or analyses. We use a loan grading system of 1 through 7. Grade 1 is\nexcellent\u201d and grade 7 is doubtful.\u201d Loans graded 5 or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to the special asset committee, which includes the Bank's Chief Credit Officer, Director of Credit Administration, Controller, Special Assets Manager and Special Assets officers. Our loan review officers, who are independent of the lending function periodically review loan portfolios and lending relationships. The loan review officer may disagree with the Bank's grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan(s) based on his risk analysis.\nOur Director of Credit Administration ( DCS\u201d) and Special Assets Manager ( SAM\u201d) and their teams are responsible for identifying and reporting all impaired loans, non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructures or TDRs and other real estate owned or OREO. They hold monthly meetings with our Controller and Special Assets Credit Administration ( SACA\u201d) who along with the SAM, is ultimately responsible for preparing the Company's allowance for loan loss calculations each quarter. The Company's CFO and others also attend these meetings periodically. The DCS, SAM and their teams make sure that all non-performing loans subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 310 ( ASC 310\u201d), as well as OREO properties, have a current appraisal (less than one year old) and that the asset is written down to 90% of the current appraisal, or less under certain circumstances, such as a listing price in the case of OREO. The purpose of the meetings is to allow the sharing of information with senior management.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance consists of three components. The first component consists of amounts specifically reserved ( specific allowance\u201d) for specific loans identified as impaired, as defined by ASC 310. Impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan agreement. Each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan, if any. That is to say, a loan may be impaired (i.e. not expected to repay as agreed), but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually, and therefore no specific reserve is warranted.\nThe second component is a general reserve ( general allowance\u201d) on all of the Company's loans other than those identified as impaired. We group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors, as well as for certain loan grading factors.\nThe third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit-impaired loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, incorporating assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool's effective interest rate. Impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio. The aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. We have $258 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Other acquired intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible and trust intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. They are initially measured at fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, generally 10 years.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are described further in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences\nresult in an effective tax rate, which differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods. We have a net deferred tax asset of $37.7 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nPurchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI\u201d) Loans\nWe account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method. All identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. We review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements. We consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The Company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value. Thus, an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date. We refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired on a quarterly basis. Losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses. An increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016.\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $55,795 or $0.97 and $0.95 per share basic and diluted, respectively, compared to $42,341 or $0.89 and $0.88 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $13,454 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense.\nNet interest income increased $56,218, or 31% to $235,543 during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $179,325 for the same period in 2016. The increase was the result of a $62,661 increase in interest income and a $6,443 increase in interest expense.\nInterest earning assets averaged $5,631,772 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4,356,455 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1,275,317, or 29%. The yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 4.46% (15 bps to 4.56% tax equivalent basis) during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.33% (4.41% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2016. The combined net effects of the $1,275,317 increase in average interest earning assets and the increase in yields on average interest earning assets resulted in the $62,661 ($64,918 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two years.\nInterest bearing liabilities averaged $3,612,651 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,834,392 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $778,259, or 27%. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased 11 bps to 0.44% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.33% for 2016. The combined net effects of the $778,259 increase in average interest bearing liabilities and the 11 bps increase in cost of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in the $6,443 increase in interest expense between the two years.

Most of our loans are secured by real estate located in Florida.\nOur strategy is to grow organically and by acquisition in our market areas or close to it. In pursuing this strategy, we seek lending teams and companies that are culturally similar to us, that are experienced and are located in our markets or in markets close to us so we can achieve economies of scale. To that end, during 2016, we established a new mortgage line of business led by an experienced mortgage lending team, and an SBA business and intend to grow those business lines in our markets, thus increasing our non-interest income. We also closed two acquisitions in 2016, closed two more acquisitions during the second quarter of 2017, and completed an additional two acquisitions on January 1, 2018.\nOur profitability depends primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income generated from interest-earning assets (i.e. loans and investments) less the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. customer deposits and borrowed funds). Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances. Net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates, deposit flows, and loan demand. Additionally, our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non-interest income and expenses, the provision for credit losses, and the effective tax rate. Non-interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services, and also includes commissions earned on bond sales, brokering single family home loans, Trust services, sale of mutual funds, annuities and other non-traditional and non-insured investments. In December 2017, we sold the trust department which generated a one-time gain of $1,224. Non-interest expense consists of compensation, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and other operating expenses.\nCorrespondent banking division\nThe correspondent banking and capital markets division is integrated with and part of our Bank, although the majority of our bond salesmen, traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. Its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services. The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions located throughout the United States.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors: reviews and evaluation of individual loans, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations, historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans.\nChanges in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses.\nWe use a standardized loan grading system which is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending. Loan officers and portfolio managers assign a loan grade to newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades. Throughout the lending relationship, the loan officer and portfolio manager is responsible for periodic reviews, and if warranted will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and/or analyses. We use a loan grading system of 1 through 7. Grade 1 is\nexcellent\u201d and grade 7 is doubtful.\u201d Loans graded 5 or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to the special asset committee, which includes the Bank's Chief Credit Officer, Director of Credit Administration, Controller, Special Assets Manager and Special Assets officers. Our loan review officers, who are independent of the lending function periodically review loan portfolios and lending relationships. The loan review officer may disagree with the Bank's grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan(s) based on his risk analysis.\nOur Director of Credit Administration ( DCS\u201d) and Special Assets Manager ( SAM\u201d) and their teams are responsible for identifying and reporting all impaired loans, non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructures or TDRs and other real estate owned or OREO. They hold monthly meetings with our Controller and Special Assets Credit Administration ( SACA\u201d) who along with the SAM, is ultimately responsible for preparing the Company's allowance for loan loss calculations each quarter. The Company's CFO and others also attend these meetings periodically. The DCS, SAM and their teams make sure that all non-performing loans subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 310 ( ASC 310\u201d), as well as OREO properties, have a current appraisal (less than one year old) and that the asset is written down to 90% of the current appraisal, or less under certain circumstances, such as a listing price in the case of OREO. The purpose of the meetings is to allow the sharing of information with senior management.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance consists of three components. The first component consists of amounts specifically reserved ( specific allowance\u201d) for specific loans identified as impaired, as defined by ASC 310. Impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan agreement. Each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan, if any. That is to say, a loan may be impaired (i.e. not expected to repay as agreed), but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually, and therefore no specific reserve is warranted.\nThe second component is a general reserve ( general allowance\u201d) on all of the Company's loans other than those identified as impaired. We group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors, as well as for certain loan grading factors.\nThe third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit-impaired loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, incorporating assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool's effective interest rate. Impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio. The aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. We have $258 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Other acquired intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible and trust intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. They are initially measured at fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, generally 10 years.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are described further in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense based on management's judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes. These permanent differences\nresult in an effective tax rate, which differs from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, based on management's judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not. In making this assessment, management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the possible application of future tax planning strategies. Management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition will be fully realized, although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods. We have a net deferred tax asset of $37.7 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nPurchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI\u201d) Loans\nWe account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method. All identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. We review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements. We consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings. The amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The Company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value. Thus, an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date. We refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired on a quarterly basis. Losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses. An increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016.\nNet Income\nOur net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $55,795 or $0.97 and $0.95 per share basic and diluted, respectively, compared to $42,341 or $0.89 and $0.88 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $13,454 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Platinum and Gateway on April 1, 2017 and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense.\nNet interest income increased $56,218, or 31% to $235,543 during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $179,325 for the same period in 2016. The increase was the result of a $62,661 increase in interest income and a $6,443 increase in interest expense.\nInterest earning assets averaged $5,631,772 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4,356,455 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1,275,317, or 29%. The yield on average interest earning assets increased 13 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 4.46% (15 bps to 4.56% tax equivalent basis) during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.33% (4.41% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2016. The combined net effects of the $1,275,317 increase in average interest earning assets and the increase in yields on average interest earning assets resulted in the $62,661 ($64,918 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two years.\nInterest bearing liabilities averaged $3,612,651 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,834,392 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $778,259, or 27%. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased 11 bps to 0.44% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.33% for 2016. The combined net effects of the $778,259 increase in average interest bearing liabilities and the 11 bps increase in cost of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in the $6,443 increase in interest expense between the two years.
