Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this report, the terms CEC Entertainment,\u201d CEC\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur MD&A includes the following sub-sections:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Executive Summary;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overview of Operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Results of Operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recently Issued Accounting Guidance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Fiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year, when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 each consisted of 52 weeks. References to 2015 and 2013 are for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 29, 2013, respectively.\nAs discussed below, we completed the Merger on February 14, 2014. As a result of the Merger, we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on February 15, 2014. Periods presented prior to and including February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the predecessor company ( Predecessor\u201d) and the period presented after February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the successor company ( Successor\u201d). The fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2014 include the 47 day Predecessor period from December 30, 2013 through February 14, 2014 ( Predecessor Period\u201d) and the 317 day Successor period from February 15, 2014 through December 28, 2014 ( Successor Period\u201d).\nExecutive Summary\nOur Strategic Plan\nOur strategic plan is focused on increasing comparable store sales, improving profitability and margins and expanding our stores domestically and internationally. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nThe Merger\nOn February 14, 2014, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), an entity controlled by Apollo Global Management, LLC ( Apollo\u201d) and its subsidiaries merged with and into CEC Entertainment Inc., with CEC Entertainment Inc. surviving the merger (the Merger\u201d or the Acquisition\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the shares of CEC Entertainment Inc. common stock ceased to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange after close of market on February 14, 2014. The aggregate consideration paid to acquire the Company was $1.4 billion, including the payoff of net debt of $348.0 million and $65.7 million in transaction and debt issuance costs. The Acquisition was funded by (a) $350.0 million of equity contributions from investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo (the Apollo Funds\u201d); (b) $248.5 million of borrowings under a bridge loan facility, which were shortly thereafter repaid using the proceeds from our issuance of $255.0 million of senior notes; and (c) $760.0 million of borrowings under a term loan facility. In addition, we also entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility in connection with the Acquisition, which was undrawn at closing. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d for additional discussion of the senior notes, term loan facility and revolving credit facility.\nAcquisition of Peter Piper Pizza\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire PPP, a leading pizza and entertainment restaurant chain operating in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, for an aggregate purchase price of $113.1 million, net of cash acquired (the PPP Acquisition\u201d). We completed the PPP Acquisition on October 16, 2014, and funded it with a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction we completed on August 25, 2014 with National Retail Properties, Inc. (the Sale Leaseback\u201d).\n53rd Week Impact\nOur Successor 2015 period (as defined below) consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods, resulting in one additional operating week in the fourth quarter of the Successor 2015 period. The favorable impact to total revenues and company store sales from the additional operating week was approximately $24.7 million, and $24.5 million, respectively. We estimate that the additional operating week benefited the Successor 2015 period net income by approximately $3.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $11.5 million, primarily due to the operating leverage obtained from the additional high sales volume in the 53rd week.\nFiscal 2015 Overview\nIn the following MD&A, we have presented the results of operations and cash flows separately for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 ( Successor 2015 period\u201d), the 317 day period from February 15, 2014 to December 28, 2014 (the Successor 2014 period\u201d), the 47 day period from December 29, 2014 to February 14, 2014 (the Predecessor 2014 period\u201d) and the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 (the Predecessor 2013 period\u201d). The Successor and Predecessor periods have been demarcated by a solid black line.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total revenues of $922.6 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to total revenues of $718.6 million in the Successor 2014 period and $114.2 million in the Predecessor 2014 period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA of $220.9 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to adjusted EBITDA of $170.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $25.0 million in the Predecessor 2014 period.

Cheese's\u201d and Peter Piper Pizza.\u201d We are located in 47 states and 12 foreign countries and territories. Our stores provide our guests with a variety of family entertainment and dining alternatives.

We define comparable store sales\u201d as the percentage change in sales for our domestic Company-owned stores that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or acquired stores we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales is a key performance indicator used within our industry and is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding our average annual comparable store sales and comparable store base:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except store number amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annual sales per comparable store (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of stores included in our comparable store base (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The information for the Fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 is presented on a 52 week basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Average annual sales per comparable store is calculated based on the average weekly sales of our comparable store base. The amount of average annual sales per comparable store cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable store sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable store base. Additionally, the average annual sales amount for Fiscal 2015 excludes the impact of an additional 53rd week of sales. Including the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015, the average annual sales per comparable store in thousands was $1,607.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Average annual sales per comparable store and the comparable store base exclude the Peter Piper Pizza branded stores that were acquired in October 2014 as we have operated them for less than 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015 and 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The PPP Company-owned stores have achieved excellent comparable store sales growth over the past several years. For Fiscal 2015, excluding the 53rd week of operations, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, PPP comparable store sales growth has been 5.2%, 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively. Including the impact of the 53rd week in 2015, the PPP comparable store sales growth for Fiscal 2015 was 7.3%.\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-owned stores ( company store sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play tokens, PlayPass card game credits and merchandise. A portion of our company store sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage and game tokens ( Package Deals\u201d), which we promote through in-store menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. We allocate the revenues recognized from the sale of our Package Deals and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it is sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component is not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, as well as the portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone game token sales, as well as a portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise store's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised stores, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. We recognize development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise store has opened and we have substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a store.\nCompany store operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-owned stores. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers, as well as the cost of tickets dispensed to customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for store personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are directly related to our Company-owned stores' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rent expense includes lease costs for Company-owned stores, excluding common occupancy costs (e.g., common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges and property taxes); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other store operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, CAM charges, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, store asset disposal gains and losses and all other costs directly related to the operation of a store.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d mentioned above exclude any allocation of (a) store employee payroll, related payroll taxes and benefit costs; (b) depreciation and amortization expense; (c) rent expense; and (d) other direct store operating expenses associated with the operation of our Company-owned stores. We believe that presenting store-level labor costs, depreciation and amortization expense, rent expense and other store operating expenses in the aggregate provides the most informative financial reporting presentation. Our rationale for excluding such costs is as follows:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our store employees are trained to sell and attend to both our dining and entertainment operations. We believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate labor costs between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>while certain assets are individually dedicated to either our food service operations or game activities, we also have significant capital investments in shared depreciating assets, such as leasehold improvements, point-of-sale systems and showroom fixtures. Therefore, we believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate depreciation and amortization expense or rent expense between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise,\u201d as a percentage of company store sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising and consulting fees, partially offset by contributions from our franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, back-office support systems and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-owned stores.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges for the estimated write down or write-off of the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our stores to their estimated fair value, which are incurred when a store's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the store. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets is similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our senior notes and/or our Secured Credit Facilities (see discussion of our senior notes and Secured Credit Facilities under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information about certain trends, material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.

The percentage amounts for the components of Cost of food and beverage and the Cost of entertainment and merchandise may not sum to total due to the fact that Cost of food and beverage and Cost of entertainment and merchandise are expressed as a percentage of related Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales, as opposed to Total Company store sales.\nSuccessor 2015 Period (Fiscal 2015) Compared to Successor 2014 Period (317 day period ended December 28, 2014) and Predecessor 2014 Period (47 day period ended February 14, 2014)\nOur 2015 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods. We have estimated the fiscal 2015 operating results on a comparable 52-week basis under the caption 53rd Week Impact.\u201d\nRevenues\nCompany store sales were $905.1 million for the Successor 2015 period compared to $712.1 million for the Successor 2014 period and $113.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. Total company store sales in the Successor 2015 period reflect revenues from our Peter Piper stores of $61.4 million, compared to $10.5 million in the Successor 2014 period, and approximately $24.5 million in Company-store sales generated from an additional week of operations in the Successor 2015 period. Before the impact of the extra week of operations in the Successor 2015 period, Chuck E. Cheese's comparable store sales decreased (0.4)% due to a decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2015 followed by three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales growth. Excluding the additional week of operations in 2015, the PPP Company-owned stores achieved comparable store sales growth of 5.2% for the 2015 fiscal year compared to the 2014 fiscal year.\nFranchise fees and royalties were $17.5 million in the Successor 2015 Period compared to $6.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in the Successor 2015 period was primarily due to an increase in the number of Chuck E. Cheese's franchise stores and franchise fees and royalties from our PPP franchise stores of $9.2 million.\nCompany Store Operating Costs\nGenerally, company store operating expenses as a percentage of sales benefited from operating leverage associated with the additional week of operations in 2015.\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company store sales, was 15.0% in the Successor 2015 period compared to 14.7% in the Successor 2014 period and 14.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 and Successor 2014 periods include the addition of PPP Company-owned stores, which have higher cost margins than our existing Chuck E. Cheese's Company-owned stores due to the higher mix of food and beverage at our PPP Company-owned stores.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were 27.7% in the Successor 2015 period, 28.2% in the Successor 2014 period and 28.2% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 period reflects improved labor management offset by an increase in minimum wage rates in certain states over the past year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $115.2 million in the Successor 2015 period, $116.0 million in the Successor 2014 period and $9.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in the Successor 2015 period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense during the Successor 2014 period from certain property, plant and equipment assets that were assigned short useful lives from the acquisition method of accounting as a result of the Merger, partially offset by a full year's depreciation of the property, plant and equipment assets acquired in the PPP Acquisition..\nRent expense was $96.7 million in the Successor 2015 period, $76.7 million in the Successor 2014 period and $12.4 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. As a result of the acquisition method of accounting related to the Merger, non-cash rent expense was $7.3 million in the Successor 2015 period and $6.9 million in the Successor 2014 period compared to $(0.9) million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in rent in the Successor 2015 period also reflects an increase in cash rent from new store development and expansions of existing stores.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses were $47.1 million in the Successor 2015 period, $33.7 million in the Successor 2014 period and $5.9 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. As a percentage of Total Company sales, advertising expenses were 5.1%, 4.7% and 5.2%, respectively, in the Successor 2015 period, Successor 2014 period, and Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 period reflects an increase in advertising directed to Moms, advertising to support our new menu launch, and an increase in advertising agency fees in connection with our transition in 2015 to new advertising agencies for our Chuck E. Cheese's stores. Advertising expense also increased as a result of PPP, which was acquired in October 2014 and therefore not included in the Successor 2014 period prior to the date of the PPP Acquisition and the Predecessor 2014 period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $66.0 million in the Successor 2015 period, $48.2 million in the Successor 2014 period and $8.0 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the Successor 2015 period is primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in PPP integration costs, costs related to the relocation of our corporate offices and incremental general and administrative expenses for PPP, which was acquired in October 2014 and therefore not included in the Successor 2014 period prior to the date of the PPP Acquisition.\nTransaction, Severance and Related Litigation Costs\nTransaction, severance and related litigation costs were $11.9 million for the Successor 2015 period, $50.5 million for the Successor 2014 period and $11.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for the Successor 2015 period relate primarily to $11.1 million in legal fees and settlements related to Merger related litigation, and severance payments of $0.7 million The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs in the Successor 2014 period include transaction costs of $42.5 million related to the Merger, the Sale Leaseback and the PPP Acquisition, Merger related litigation costs of $1.8 million, and employee benefits of $6.3 million related to the departure of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a result of the Merger. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs in the Predecessor 2014 period include $11.1 million in accelerated stock-based compensation costs also related to the Merger.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $70.6 million in the Successor 2015 period, $61.0 million in the Successor 2014 period, and $1.2 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. Interest expense in the Successor 2015 period reflects a full year of interest on the debt issued to fund a portion of the Merger when compared to the Successor 2014 period. Our weighted average effective interest rate under our Secured Credit Facilities and senior notes was 5.5% for the Successor 2015 period and 6.2% for the Successor 2014 period (including the bridge loan). Excluding the impact of $4.9 million of issuance costs and interim interest related to the bridge loan facility, our weighted average effective interest rate would have been 5.7% for the Successor 2014 period.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 19.0% in the Successor 2015 period, 33.4% in the Successor 2014 period and 59.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period. Our effective income tax rate for the Successor 2015 period differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible legal fees and settlements related to the Merger, partially offset by benefits stemming from federal and state employment related income tax credits. Our effective income tax rate for the Successor 2014 period differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible costs related to the Merger and acquisition of PPP, partially offset by the favorable impact of a net decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate for the Predecessor 2014 period differs from the statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible costs related to the Merger, a net increase in our liability for uncertain tax positions, and an increase in income tax expense resulting from certain state income tax credits carried forward which we estimate will expire unused, partially offset by federal employment related income tax credits.\nSuccessor 2014 Period (317 day period ended December 28, 2014) Compared to Predecessor 2014 Period (47 day period ended February 14, 2014) and Predecessor 2013 Period (Fiscal 2013)\nRevenues\nCompany store sales were $712.1 million for the Successor 2014 period, compared to $113.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period and $816.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 period. Company store sales in the Successor 2014 period reflect revenues from eleven additional Chuck E. Cheese's branded stores opened, less revenues from seven stores closed since February 14, 2014, and store sales from Peter Piper Pizza branded stores of $10.5 million. Total company store sales in the Successor 2014 period and Predecessor 2014 period reflect a 2.2% decrease in comparable store sales. Franchise fees and royalties were $6.5 million in the Successor 2014 period, $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period and $5.0 million in the Predecessor 2013 period. The increase in the Successor 2014 period was primarily due to an increase in the number of Chuck E. Cheese's franchise stores and franchise fees and royalties from our PPP franchise stores of $1.8 million.\nCompany Store Operating Costs\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total Company store sales, was 14.7% in the Successor 2014 period, 14.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period, and 14.7% in Predecessor 2013 period. The decrease in\nthe Predecessor 2014 period was attributable to our cost savings initiatives that were fully implemented in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by commodity cost inflation during 2014.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total Company store sales, were 28.2% in the Successor 2014 period, 28.2% in the Predecessor 2014 period, and 28.1% in Predecessor 2013 period. Labor expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $116.0 million in the Successor 2014 period, $9.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period and $78.2 million in Predecessor 2013 period. The increase in depreciation and amortization in the Successor 2014 period is primarily due to a higher basis in our property, plant and equipment from the acquisition method of accounting as a result of the Merger.\nRent expense was $76.7 million in the Successor 2014 period, $12.4 million in the Predecessor 2014 period and $78.5 million in Predecessor 2013 period. As a result of the acquisition method of accounting related to the Merger, non-cash rent expense was $6.9 million in the Successor 2014 period compared to $(0.9) million in the Predecessor 2014 period and $1.3 million in the Predecessor 2013 period. The increase in rent in the Successor 2014 period also reflects an increase in cash rent from new store development and expansions of existing stores.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses were $33.7 million in the Successor 2014 period, $5.9 million in the Predecessor 2014 period, and $41.2 million in the Predecessor 2013 period. As a percentage of Total company sales, advertising expenses were 4.7%, 5.2%, and 5.0%, respectively, in the Successor 2014 period, Predecessor 2014 period and Predecessor 2013 period, reflecting a reduction in digital brand advertising spend and a decrease in television production costs, partially offset by an increase in national television advertising.\nTransaction, Severance and Related Litigation Costs\nTransaction, severance and related litigation costs were $50.5 million for the Successor 2014 period and $11.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs in the Successor 2014 period include transaction costs of $42.5 million related to the Merger, the Sale Leaseback and the PPP Acquisition, Merger related litigation costs of $1.8 million, and employee benefits of $6.3 million related to the departure of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a result of the Merger. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs in the Predecessor 2014 period include $11.1 million in accelerated stock-based compensation costs also related to the Merger. There were $0.3 million of Transaction, severance and related litigation costs in Predecessor 2013 period.\nAsset Impairments\nIn the Successor 2014 period, we recognized an asset impairment charge of $0.4 million primarily related to four stores. In the Predecessor 2013 period, we recognized an asset impairment charge of $3.1 million primarily related to seven stores, of which three stores were previously impaired. We continue to operate all but one of these stores. The impairment charge was based on the determination that these stores were adversely impacted by various economic factors in the markets in which they are located. Management determined that the estimated fair value of certain long-lived assets at these stores (determined from discounted future projected operating cash flows of the stores over their remaining lease term) had declined below their carrying amount. For additional information about these impairment charges, refer to Note 6. Property and Equipment - Asset Impairments\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $61.0 million in the Successor 2014 period, $1.2 million in the Predecessor 2014 period, and $7.5 million in the Predecessor 2013 period. Interest expense in the Successor 2014 period reflects an increase in our level of debt compared to the Predecessor 2014 and 2013 periods, as a result of debt issued to fund a portion of the Merger, as well as an increase in our weighted average effective interest rate. Interest expense for the Successor 2014 period also includes amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Secured Credit Facilities and senior notes, amortization of our term loan facility original issue discount, commitment and other fees related to our Secured Credit Facilities and interest related to the Sale Leaseback and capital leases. Our weighted average effective interest rate under our Secured Credit Facilities and senior notes, including the bridge loan, for the Successor 2014 period was 6.2%. Excluding the impact of $4.9 million of issuance costs and interim interest related to the bridge loan facility, our weighted average effective interest rate would have been 5.7% for the Successor 2014 period.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 33.4% in the Successor 2014 period, 59.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period, and 37.1% in Predecessor 2013 period. Our effective income tax rate for the Successor 2014 period differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible costs related to the Merger and the PPP Acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impact of a net decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions (primarily resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations). Our effective income tax rate for the Predecessor 2014 period differs from the statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of non-deductible costs related to the Merger, a net increase in our liability for uncertain tax positions, an increase in income tax expense resulting from certain state income tax credits carried forward which we estimate will expire unused, partially offset by federal employment related tax credits. The Predecessor 2013 period effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits which were greater in amount for the year due to the retroactive reinstatement of the credit program enacted January 2, 2013, as well as the favorable impact of a net decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions (primarily resulting from the settlement of positions with tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations).\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nWe finance our business activities through cash flows provided by our operations.\nThe primary components of working capital are as follows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our store customers pay for their purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale and the cash from these sales is typically received before our related accounts payable to suppliers and employee payroll becomes due;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>frequent inventory turnover results in a limited investment required in inventories;

We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance our strategic plan and capital initiatives for the next twelve months. Our revolving credit facility is also available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. However, in the event of a material decline in our sales trends or operating margins, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows at or above our current levels. Our ability to access our revolving credit facility is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement governing such facility, including our compliance with certain prescribed covenants, as more fully described below. Our primary uses for cash provided by operating activities relate to funding our ongoing business activities, planned capital expenditures, servicing our debt, and the payment of income taxes.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $50.7 million as of January 3, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 3, 2016 includes $6.2 million of undistributed income from our Canadian subsidiary that we consider to be permanently invested.\nOur strategic plan does not require that we enter into any material development or contractual purchase obligations. Therefore, we have the flexibility necessary to manage our liquidity by promptly deferring or curtailing any planned capital spending. In 2016, our planned capital spending includes new store development, existing store improvements, improvements to our various information technologies platforms and other capital initiatives.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Successor 2015 period Compared to Successor 2014 period and Predecessor 2014 period\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $100.6 million in the Successor 2015 period, $48.1 million in the Successor 2014 period and $22.3 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2014 period reflects the impact of transaction, severance and related litigation costs that were expensed in connection with the Merger, as well as an increase in interest expense related to the new debt issued in connection with the Merger. The net cash provided by operating activities in the Predecessor 2014 period also reflects the impact of transaction costs expensed in connection with the Merger.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $78.2 million in the Successor 2015 period, $1,124.3 million in the Successor 2014 period and $9.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. Net cash used in investing activities in the Successor 2015 period relates primarily to store related capital expenditures. The net cash used in investing activities in the Successor 2014 period relates primarily to consideration paid in connection with the Merger and the PPP acquisition of $946.9 million and $113.1 million, respectively.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(81.6) million in the Successor 2015 period, $1,168.4 million in the Successor 2014 period and $(13.8) million in the Predecessor 2014 period. In Fiscal 2015, we paid a $70.0 million dividend, which is reflected as cash used in financing activities in the Successor 2015 period. The cash provided by financing activities in the Successor 2014 period relates primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,011.2 million, the Apollo Funds' equity contribution of $350.0 million, also in connection with the Merger, and proceeds from the Sale Leaseback of $183.7 million, partially offset by the repayment of the Predecessor revolving credit facility of $348.0 million.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Successor 2014 period Compared to Predecessor 2014 period and Predecessor 2013 period\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $48.1 million in the Successor 2014 period, $22.3 million in the Predecessor 2014 period and $138.7 million in the Predecessor 2013 period. The Successor 2014 period reflects the impact of transaction, severance and related litigation costs that were expensed in connection with the Merger and the PPP Acquisition, as well as an increase in interest expense related to the new debt issued in connection with the Merger. The net cash provided by operating activities for the Predecessor 2014 period reflects the impact of transaction costs incurred in connection with the Merger.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,124.3 million in the Successor 2014 period, relates primarily to consideration paid in connection with the Merger and the PPP Acquisition of $946.9 million and $113.1 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in the Predecessor 2014 period and in Predecessor 2013 period relates primarily to store related capital expenditures.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,168.4 million in the Successor 2014 period, relating primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of debt in connection with the Merger totaling $1,011.2 million, the Apollo Funds' equity contribution of $350 million, also in connection with the Merger, and proceeds from the Sale Leaseback of $183.7 million, partially offset by the repayment of the Predecessor revolving credit facility of $348.0 million. The net cash used in financing activities in the Predecessor 2014 period primarily relates to repayments on the Predecessor revolving credit facility, while Predecessor 2013 period includes repayments on the Predecessor revolving credit facility of $28.0 million, dividends paid of $17.1 million and common stock repurchases of $18.1 million.\nDebt Financing\nPredecessor Facility\nIn connection with the Merger on February 14, 2014, we repaid the total outstanding borrowings of $348.0 million under the Predecessor revolving credit facility (the Predecessor Facility\u201d), as well as all incurred and unpaid interest on the Predecessor Facility. The debt financing costs related to the Predecessor Facility were removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheet through acquisition accounting.\nSecured Credit Facilities\nIn connection with the Merger on February 14, 2014, we entered into new senior secured credit facilities (the Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), which include a $760.0 million term loan facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2021 (the term loan facility\u201d) and a $150.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2019, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility and a $30.0 million swingline loan sub-facility (the revolving credit facility\u201dand, together with the term loan facility, the Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). As of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $10.9 million of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the facility.\nIn addition, we may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of (a) $200.0 million plus (b) such additional amount so long as, (i) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank equally and without preference with the liens on the collateral securing the Secured Credit Facilities, our consolidated net first lien senior secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 4.25 to 1.00 and (ii) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank junior to the liens on the collateral securing the Secured Credit Facilities, our consolidated total net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 5.25 to 1.00, subject to certain conditions, and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders.\nAll borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties.\nWe received net proceeds from the term loan facility of $756.2 million, net of original issue discount of $3.8 million, which were used to fund a portion of the Acquisition. We paid $17.8 million and $3.4 million in debt financing costs related to the term loan facility and revolving credit facility, respectively, which we capitalized in Bank indebtedness and other long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The original issue discount and deferred financing costs are amortized over the lives of the facilities and are included in Interest expense\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nBorrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowings, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor in the case of term loans or (b) a base\nrate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%; (ii) the prime rate of Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings is 3.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 2.25% with respect to base rate borrowings under the term loan facility and base rate borrowings and swingline borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is subject to one step down to 3.00% based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio, and the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to two step-downs to 3.00% and 2.75% based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio. During Fiscal 2015, the federal funds rate ranged from 0.06% to 0.37%, the prime rate was 3.25% and the one-month LIBOR ranged from 0.17% to 0.43%.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The applicable commitment fee under the revolving credit facility is subject to a step-down to 0.375% based on our first lien senior secured leverage ratio. We are also required to pay customary agency fees, as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer's customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit.\nAfter the third quarter of 2014, our applicable margin under the term loan facility stepped down to 3.00% with respect to LIBOR borrowings, 2.00% with respect to base rate borrowings, and 0.375% with respect to commitment fees. However, these margins returned to their initial rates after the third quarter of 2015. As a result of our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the period ending January 3, 2016, we believe our applicable margin will step down during the first quarter of 2016 to 3.00% with respect to LIBOR borrowings, 2.00% with respect to base rate borrowings, and 0.375% with respect to commitment fees.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our Secured Credit Facilities was 4.6% during Fiscal 2015 and 4.8% for the 317 day period ended December 28, 2014, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Secured Credit Facilities, amortization of our term loan facility original issue discount, and commitment and other fees related to our Secured Credit Facilities. The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our Predecessor Facility for the 47 day period ended February 14, 2014 was 1.6%.\nThe Secured Credit Facilities require scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loan from July 2014 to December 2020, with the remaining balance paid at maturity, February 14, 2021. In addition, the Secured Credit Facilities include customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales, debt issuances and defined levels of excess cash flow.\nWe may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Secured Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event as described below, subject to customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. Any refinancing through the issuance or repricing amendment of any debt that results in a repricing event applicable to the term loan facility borrowings resulting in a lower yield occurring at any time during the first six months after the closing date will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium or fee, as applicable.\nOur revolving credit facility includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed 6.25 to 1.00 (the ratio of consolidated net debt secured by first-priority liens on the collateral to last twelve month's EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The covenant will be tested quarterly when the revolving credit facility is more than 30.0% drawn (excluding outstanding letters of credit) and will be a condition to drawings under the revolving credit facility that would result in more than 30.0% drawn thereunder. As of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the borrowings under the revolving credit facility were less than 30.0% of the outstanding commitments; therefore, the springing financial maintenance covenant under our revolving credit facility was not in effect.\nThe Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, and the negative covenants limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) create liens on certain assets; (iii) make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); (iv) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; (vi) sell assets; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; (vii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (viii) change our lines of business; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens; (ix) change our fiscal year; and (x) modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.\nAll obligations under the Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Parent on a limited-recourse basis and each of our existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of our capital stock and substantially all of our assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the subsidiary guarantors and 65.0% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign\nsubsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions. Such security interests will consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the collateral.\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nAlso in connection with the Merger on February 14, 2014, we borrowed $248.5 million under a bridge loan facility (the bridge loan facility\u201d) and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the Acquisition. We incurred $4.7 million of financing costs and $0.2 million of interest related to the bridge loan facility, which are included in Interest expense\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the 317 day period ended December 28, 2014.\nOn February 19, 2014, we issued $255.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% Senior Notes due in 2022 (the senior notes\u201d) in a private offering. The senior notes bear interest at a rate of 8.000% per year and mature on February 15, 2022. On or after February 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at certain redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes (the indenture\u201d). Prior to February 15, 2017, we may redeem (i) up to 40.0% of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a price equal to 108.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) some or all of the notes at a price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole\u201d premium set forth in the indenture.\nOn December 2, 2014 we completed an exchange offer whereby the original senior notes were exchanged for new notes (the exchange notes\u201d) which are identical to the initial senior notes except that the issuance of the exchange notes is registered under the Securities Act, the exchange notes do not bear legends restricting their transfer and they are not entitled to registration rights under our registration rights agreement. The exchange notes will evidence the same debt as the initial notes, and both the initial senior notes and the exchange notes are governed by the same indenture. We refer to the senior notes and the exchange notes collectively as the senior notes.\u201d\nWe paid $6.4 million in debt issuance costs related to the senior notes issued in February 2014, which we recorded as an offset to Bank indebtedness and other long-term debt, less current portion\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred financing costs are being amortized over the life of the senior notes to Interest expense\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on borrowings under our senior notes was 8.3% for both the 2015 fiscal year and the 317 day period ended December 28, 2014, which included amortization of debt issuance costs and other fees related to our senior notes.\nOur obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) create liens on certain assets; (iii) make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); (iv) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; (vi) sell assets; (vii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and (viii) restrict dividends from our subsidiaries.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe intend to continue to focus our future capital expenditures on reinvestment into our existing Company-owned Chuck E. Cheese's and PPP stores through various planned capital initiatives and the development or acquisition of additional Company-owned stores. During Fiscal 2015, we completed 268 game enhancements, 26 major remodels and one store expansion, and we opened five new domestic Company-owned Chuck E. Cheese's stores, including two relocated stores. We have funded and expect to continue to fund our capital expenditures through existing cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures in 2015 totaled approximately $77.8 million.\nThe following table reconciles the approximate total capital spend by initiative to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 317 Day Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 47 Day Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital spend (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital spend (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT capital spend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Spend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1) Growth capital spend includes major remodels, store expansions, major attractions and new store development, including relocations and franchise\nacquisitions.\n(2) Maintenance capital spend includes game enhancements, general store capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.\nWe currently estimate our capital expenditures in 2016 will total approximately $105 million to $115 million. These capital expenditures consist of the following: (i) approximately $30 million for maintenance capital which includes games enhancements and general store maintenance capital expenditures; (ii) approximately $10 million for investments in one-time information technology initiatives; (iii) approximately $40 million to $45 million for various growth initiatives, including new store openings and major remodels and (iv) approximately $25 million to $30 million related to our PlayPass initiative. We currently expect to open eight to 13 new Company-owned Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza stores. In addition we are re-evaluating our store design for Chuck E. Cheese's stores as part of an effort to launch a new store prototype to regional markets. We expect to fund our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and existing cash on hand.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nAs of January 3, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements as described in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2016: Table 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,016,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>588,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>31,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>51,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured credit facilities\n</td> <td>746,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>255,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note payable - Peter Piper Pizza\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations (3)\n</td> <td>299,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale leaseback obligations\n</td> <td>290,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (4)\n</td> <td>1,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,693,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,831,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes the initial non-cancelable term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured but excludes contingent rent obligations and obligations to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance on the leased assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>A purchase obligation\u201d is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; (b) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and (c) the approximate timing of the transaction.

These amounts are expected to be paid in less than one year.\nThe total estimate of accrued liabilities for our self-insurance programs was $14.9 million as of January 3, 2016. We estimate that $5.2 million of these liabilities will be paid in fiscal 2016 and the remainder paid in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended period of time often experienced in resolving insurance claims, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash payments to be made in the future for our obligations related to our insurance liabilities. Therefore, no amounts for such liabilities have been included in the table above.\nAs of January 3, 2016, there were $10.9 million of letters of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility. We utilize standby letters of credit primarily for our self-insurance programs. These letters of credit do not represent additional obligations of the Company since the underlying liabilities are already recorded in accrued liabilities. However, if we were unable to pay insurance claims when due, our insurance carrier could make demand for payment pursuant to these letters of credit.\nIn addition, see further discussion of our indebtedness and future debt obligations above under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing.\u201d As of January 3, 2016, there have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations since December 28, 2014.\nWe enter into various purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business and have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products. Other than the purchase obligations\nincluded in the above table, we do not have any material contracts (either individually or in the aggregate) in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases or that are cancelable subject to significant penalty.\nInflation\nOur cost of operations, including but not limited to labor, food products, supplies, utilities, financing and rental costs, can be significantly affected by inflationary factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our Consolidated Financial Statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our Consolidated Financial Statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time our Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments and is material to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies and estimates that our management considers most critical are as follows:\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company has accounted for the Merger and the PPP acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair market values. Fair value measurements are applied based on assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability. In connection with purchase price allocations, management has made estimates of the fair values of the long-lived and intangible assets based upon assumptions that are reasonable related to discount rates and asset lives utilizing currently available information, and in some cases, preliminary valuation results from independent valuation specialists. The Company also recorded purchase accounting adjustments to the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets, including the Chuck E. Cheese's\u201d and Peter Piper Pizza\u201d tradenames, franchise agreements and favorable leases. The Company has also revalued its rent related liabilities. Purchase price allocations can change in subsequent periods, up to one year from the dates of the acquisitions. During Fiscal 2015 we made certain adjustments to the initial Peter Piper Pizza purchase price allocation related to the final settlement of net working capital, the valuation of favorable and unfavorable lease interests, PPP's tradename, and the valuation of net operating losses acquired and other tax positions, which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $0.4 million. These adjustments did not result in material changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business ( goodwill\u201d), trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather tested quantitatively and qualitatively for impairment, at least annually, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. We determined that no triggering events occurred during Fiscal 2015.\nRecoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, we measure the recoverability of goodwill for our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow\nprojections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital considering any differences in company-specific risk factors.\nWe tested our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2015. The fair value of our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of the date of our Fiscal 2015 goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment test through the end of Fiscal 2015.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis at the lowest level of cash flows available, which is on a store-by-store basis, to assess if the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or changes may include a significant change in the business climate in a particular market area (for example, due to economic downturn or natural disaster), historical negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell the property and equipment before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If an event or change in circumstances occurs, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the property and equipment and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may be required to recognize an impairment loss. We estimate the fair value of a store's property and equipment by discounting the expected future cash flows of the store over its remaining lease term using a weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the risk.\nThe following estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis impact the fair value of a store's long-lived assets:\n\u2022Discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return;\n\u2022Sales growth rates and cash flow margins over the expected remaining lease terms;\n\u2022Strategic plans, including projected capital spending and intent to exercise renewal options, for the store;\n\u2022Salvage values; and\n\u2022Other risks and qualitative factors specific to the asset or conditions in the market in which the asset is\nlocated at the time the assessment was made.\nDuring Fiscal 2015, the average discount rate, average sales growth rate and average cash flow margin rate used were 6.6%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nEstimation of Reserves\nThe liabilities we record for claims related to insurance and tax reserves requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use historical experience, as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these contingencies, in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nSelf-Insurance reserves. We are self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability, property, and company-sponsored employee health plans. Liabilities associated with risks retained by the Company are estimated primarily using historical claims experience, current claims data, demographic and severity factors, other factors deemed relevant by us, as well as information provided by independent third-party actuaries. To limit our exposure for certain losses, we purchase stop-loss or high-deductible insurance coverage through third-party insurers. Our stop-loss limit or deductibles for workers' compensation, general liability, property, and company-sponsored employee health plans, generally range from $0.2 million to $0.5 million per occurrence. As of January 3, 2016, our total estimate of accrued liabilities for our self-insurance and high deductible plan programs was $14.9 million. We estimate $5.2 million of these liabilities will be paid in\nfiscal 2016 and the remainder paid in fiscal 2017 and beyond. If actual claims trends or other factors differ from our estimates, our financial results could be significantly impacted.\nIncome tax reserves. We are subject to audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities. We maintain reserves for federal, state and foreign income taxes when we believe a position may not be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our tax positions are fully supported by the applicable tax laws and regulations, there are matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain. We recognize the benefit from an uncertain tax position in our Consolidated Financial Statements when the position is more-likely-than-not (a greater than 50 percent chance of being sustained). The amount recognized is measured using a probability weighted approach and is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement or ultimate resolution with the taxing authority. We routinely assess the adequacy of the estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities and administrative policies, certain changes and/or developments with respect to audits and expirations of the statute of limitations. Depending on the nature of the tax issue, the ultimate resolution of an uncertain tax position may not be known for a number of years; therefore, the estimated reserve balances could be included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for multiple years. To the extent that new information becomes available that causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of a reserve balance, such a change will affect our income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made and the reserve is adjusted. Significant judgment is required to estimate our provision for income taxes and liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At January 3, 2016, the reserve for uncertain tax positions (unrecognized tax benefits) was $3.3 million and the related interest and penalties was $1.7 million. Although we believe our approach is appropriate, there can be no assurance that the final outcome resulting from a tax authority's review will not be materially different than the amounts reflected in our estimated tax provision and tax reserves. If the results of any audit materially differ from the liabilities we have established for taxes, there would be a corresponding impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, current tax provision, effective tax rate, net after tax earnings and cash flows, in the period of resolution.\nAccounting for Leases\nThe majority of our stores are leased. The terms of our store leases vary in length from lease to lease, although a typical lease provides for an initial primary term of 10 years with two additional five year options to renew. We estimate the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options, in addition to the initial non-cancelable lease term, if the renewal is reasonably assured. Generally, reasonably assured\u201d relates to our contractual right to renew and the existence of an economic penalty that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable lease term. The expected term is used in the determination of whether a lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the reasonably assured renewal period or economic life of the asset.\nThe determination of the expected term of a lease requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning the number of renewal periods that are reasonably assured. If a lease is terminated prior to reaching the end of the expected term, this may result in the acceleration of depreciation or impairment of a store's long-lived assets, and it may result in the accelerated recognition of landlord contributions and the reversal of deferred rent balances that assumed higher rent payments in renewal periods that were never ultimately exercised by us.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRefer to Note 1.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this report, the terms CEC Entertainment,\u201d CEC\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur MD&A includes the following sub-sections:\n \u2022 Executive Summary; \n \u2022 Overview of Operations; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations; \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and \n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Guidance.  Fiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year, when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 each consisted of 52 weeks. References to 2015 and 2013 are for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 29, 2013, respectively.\nAs discussed below, we completed the Merger on February 14, 2014. As a result of the Merger, we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on February 15, 2014. Periods presented prior to and including February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the predecessor company ( Predecessor\u201d) and the period presented after February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the successor company ( Successor\u201d). The fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2014 include the 47 day Predecessor period from December 30, 2013 through February 14, 2014 ( Predecessor Period\u201d) and the 317 day Successor period from February 15, 2014 through December 28, 2014 ( Successor Period\u201d).\nExecutive Summary\nOur Strategic Plan\nOur strategic plan is focused on increasing comparable store sales, improving profitability and margins and expanding our stores domestically and internationally. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nThe Merger\nOn February 14, 2014, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), an entity controlled by Apollo Global Management, LLC ( Apollo\u201d) and its subsidiaries merged with and into CEC Entertainment Inc., with CEC Entertainment Inc. surviving the merger (the Merger\u201d or the Acquisition\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the shares of CEC Entertainment Inc. common stock ceased to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange after close of market on February 14, 2014. The aggregate consideration paid to acquire the Company was $1.4 billion, including the payoff of net debt of $348.0 million and $65.7 million in transaction and debt issuance costs. The Acquisition was funded by (a) $350.0 million of equity contributions from investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo (the Apollo Funds\u201d); (b) $248.5 million of borrowings under a bridge loan facility, which were shortly thereafter repaid using the proceeds from our issuance of $255.0 million of senior notes; and (c) $760.0 million of borrowings under a term loan facility. In addition, we also entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility in connection with the Acquisition, which was undrawn at closing. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d for additional discussion of the senior notes, term loan facility and revolving credit facility.\nAcquisition of Peter Piper Pizza\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire PPP, a leading pizza and entertainment restaurant chain operating in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, for an aggregate purchase price of $113.1 million, net of cash acquired (the PPP Acquisition\u201d). We completed the PPP Acquisition on October 16, 2014, and funded it with a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction we completed on August 25, 2014 with National Retail Properties, Inc. (the Sale Leaseback\u201d).\n53rd Week Impact\nOur Successor 2015 period (as defined below) consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods, resulting in one additional operating week in the fourth quarter of the Successor 2015 period. The favorable impact to total revenues and company store sales from the additional operating week was approximately $24.7 million, and $24.5 million, respectively. We estimate that the additional operating week benefited the Successor 2015 period net income by approximately $3.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $11.5 million, primarily due to the operating leverage obtained from the additional high sales volume in the 53rd week.\nFiscal 2015 Overview\nIn the following MD&A, we have presented the results of operations and cash flows separately for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 ( Successor 2015 period\u201d), the 317 day period from February 15, 2014 to December 28, 2014 (the Successor 2014 period\u201d), the 47 day period from December 29, 2014 to February 14, 2014 (the Predecessor 2014 period\u201d) and the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 (the Predecessor 2013 period\u201d). The Successor and Predecessor periods have been demarcated by a solid black line.\n \u2022 Total revenues of $922.6 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to total revenues of $718.6 million in the Successor 2014 period and $114.2 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $220.9 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to adjusted EBITDA of $170.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $25.0 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. We estimate our Adjusted EBITDA for 2015, before the impact of the 53rd week, to be approximately $209.4 million. \n \u2022 Net loss of $12.5 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to a net loss of $62.1 million in the Successor 2014 period and net income of $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operations was $100.6 million for the Successor 2015 period compared to $48.1 million for the Successor 2014 period and $22.3 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in the Successor 2015 period was primarily driven by an additional week of operations in 2015, transaction, severance and related litigation costs incurred in 2014 in connection with the Merger.  Overview of Operations\nWe currently operate and franchise family dining and entertainment centers under the names Chuck E. Cheese's\u201d and Peter Piper Pizza.\u201d We are located in 47 states and 12 foreign countries and territories. Our stores provide our guests with a variety of family entertainment and dining alternatives. Our family leisure offerings include video games, skill games, rides, musical and comical shows and other attractions along with tokens, tickets and prizes for kids. Our wholesome family dining offerings are centered on made-to-order pizzas, salads, sandwiches, wings, appetizers, beverages and desserts.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding the number of Company-owned and franchised stores for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) The number of new and closed Company-owned stores during 2015, 2014 and 2013 included two, two and one stores, respectively,  that were relocated.\n (2) In October 2014, we acquired Peter Piper Pizza, including 32 Company-owned stores and 110 franchised stores. \n (3) The number of new and closed franchise stores during 2015, 2014 and 2013 included two, one, and one stores, respectively, that were relocated. \n (4) The number of new and closed stores during 2015, 2014 and 2013 included four, three and two stores, respectively, that were relocated. \nComparable store sales. We define comparable store sales\u201d as the percentage change in sales for our domestic Company-owned stores that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or acquired stores we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales is a key performance indicator used within our industry and is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding our average annual comparable store sales and comparable store base:\n\n__________________\n (1) The information for the Fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 is presented on a 52 week basis. \n (2) Average annual sales per comparable store is calculated based on the average weekly sales of our comparable store base. The amount of average annual sales per comparable store cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable store sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable store base. Additionally, the average annual sales amount for Fiscal 2015 excludes the impact of an additional 53rd week of sales. Including the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015, the average annual sales per comparable store in thousands was $1,607. \n (3) Average annual sales per comparable store and the comparable store base exclude the Peter Piper Pizza branded stores that were acquired in October 2014 as we have operated them for less than 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015 and 2014.  The PPP Company-owned stores have achieved excellent comparable store sales growth over the past several years. For Fiscal 2015, excluding the 53rd week of operations, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, PPP comparable store sales growth has been 5.2%, 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively. Including the impact of the 53rd week in 2015, the PPP comparable store sales growth for Fiscal 2015 was 7.3%.\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-owned stores ( company store sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play tokens, PlayPass card game credits and merchandise. A portion of our company store sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage and game tokens ( Package Deals\u201d), which we promote through in-store menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. We allocate the revenues recognized from the sale of our Package Deals and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it is sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component is not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, as well as the portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone game token sales, as well as a portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise store's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised stores, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. We recognize development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise store has opened and we have substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a store.\nCompany store operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-owned stores. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\n \u2022 Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers; \n \u2022 Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers, as well as the cost of tickets dispensed to customers; \n \u2022 Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for store personnel; \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are directly related to our Company-owned stores' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment; \n \u2022 Rent expense includes lease costs for Company-owned stores, excluding common occupancy costs (e.g., common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges and property taxes); and \n \u2022 Other store operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, CAM charges, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, store asset disposal gains and losses and all other costs directly related to the operation of a store.  The Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d mentioned above exclude any allocation of (a) store employee payroll, related payroll taxes and benefit costs; (b) depreciation and amortization expense; (c) rent expense; and (d) other direct store operating expenses associated with the operation of our Company-owned stores. We believe that presenting store-level labor costs, depreciation and amortization expense, rent expense and other store operating expenses in the aggregate provides the most informative financial reporting presentation. Our rationale for excluding such costs is as follows:\n \u2022 our store employees are trained to sell and attend to both our dining and entertainment operations. We believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate labor costs between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d; and \n \u2022 while certain assets are individually dedicated to either our food service operations or game activities, we also have significant capital investments in shared depreciating assets, such as leasehold improvements, point-of-sale systems and showroom fixtures. Therefore, we believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate depreciation and amortization expense or rent expense between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales.\u201d  Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise,\u201d as a percentage of company store sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising and consulting fees, partially offset by contributions from our franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, back-office support systems and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-owned stores.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges for the estimated write down or write-off of the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our stores to their estimated fair value, which are incurred when a store's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the store. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets is similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our senior notes and/or our Secured Credit Facilities (see discussion of our senior notes and Secured Credit Facilities under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information about certain trends, material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. See Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information about Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our principal sources of Total company store sales expressed in dollars and as a percentage of Total company store sales for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) Company store sales for the Successor 2014 period include sales from the acquired Peter Piper Pizza stores for the 73 day period from October 17, 2014 through December 28, 2014. Total Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales from PPP stores were $8.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for the 2014 Successor period since the PPP Acquisition. \n (2) Company store sales for Fiscal 2015 include the impact of an additional 53rd week of revenues. Excluding the 53rd week in 2015, total company store sales were approximately $880.7 million. \nThe following table summarizes our revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of Total revenues (except as otherwise noted) for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Food and beverage sales. \n (2) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise sales. \n (3) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Company store sales. \n (4) Results for the Successor 2014 period include the revenues and expenses for PPP for the 73 day period from October 17, 2014 through December 28, 2014.  Due to rounding, percentages presented in the table above may not sum to total. The percentage amounts for the components of Cost of food and beverage and the Cost of entertainment and merchandise may not sum to total due to the fact that Cost of food and beverage and Cost of entertainment and merchandise are expressed as a percentage of related Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales, as opposed to Total Company store sales.\nSuccessor 2015 Period (Fiscal 2015) Compared to Successor 2014 Period (317 day period ended December 28, 2014) and Predecessor 2014 Period (47 day period ended February 14, 2014)\nOur 2015 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods. We have estimated the fiscal 2015 operating results on a comparable 52-week basis under the caption 53rd Week Impact.\u201d\nRevenues\nCompany store sales were $905.1 million for the Successor 2015 period compared to $712.1 million for the Successor 2014 period and $113.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. Total company store sales in the Successor 2015 period reflect revenues from our Peter Piper stores of $61.4 million, compared to $10.5 million in the Successor 2014 period, and approximately $24.5 million in Company-store sales generated from an additional week of operations in the Successor 2015 period. Before the impact of the extra week of operations in the Successor 2015 period, Chuck E. Cheese's comparable store sales decreased (0.4)% due to a decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2015 followed by three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales growth. Excluding the additional week of operations in 2015, the PPP Company-owned stores achieved comparable store sales growth of 5.2% for the 2015 fiscal year compared to the 2014 fiscal year.\nFranchise fees and royalties were $17.5 million in the Successor 2015 Period compared to $6.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in the Successor 2015 period was primarily due to an increase in the number of Chuck E. Cheese's franchise stores and franchise fees and royalties from our PPP franchise stores of $9.2 million.\nCompany Store Operating Costs\nGenerally, company store operating expenses as a percentage of sales benefited from operating leverage associated with the additional week of operations in 2015.\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company store sales, was 15.0% in the Successor 2015 period compared to 14.7% in the Successor 2014 period and 14.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 and Successor 2014 periods include the addition of PPP Company-owned stores, which have higher cost margins than our existing Chuck E. Cheese's Company-owned stores due to the higher mix of food and beverage at our PPP Company-owned stores.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were 27.7% in the Successor 2015 period, 28.2% in the Successor 2014 period and 28.2% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 period reflects improved labor management offset by an increase in minimum wage rates in certain states over the past year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $115.2 million in the Successor 2015 period, $116.0 million in the Successor 2014 period and $9.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in the Successor 2015 period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense during the Successor 2014 period from certain property, plant and equipment assets that were assigned short useful lives from the acquisition method of accounting as a result of the Merger, partially offset by a full year's depreciation of the property, plant and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this report, the terms CEC Entertainment,\u201d CEC\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur MD&A includes the following sub-sections:\n \u2022 Executive Summary; \n \u2022 Overview of Operations; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations; \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and \n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Guidance.  Fiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year, when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 each consisted of 52 weeks. References to 2015 and 2013 are for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 29, 2013, respectively.\nAs discussed below, we completed the Merger on February 14, 2014. As a result of the Merger, we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on February 15, 2014. Periods presented prior to and including February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the predecessor company ( Predecessor\u201d) and the period presented after February 14, 2014 represent the operations of the successor company ( Successor\u201d). The fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2014 include the 47 day Predecessor period from December 30, 2013 through February 14, 2014 ( Predecessor Period\u201d) and the 317 day Successor period from February 15, 2014 through December 28, 2014 ( Successor Period\u201d).\nExecutive Summary\nOur Strategic Plan\nOur strategic plan is focused on increasing comparable store sales, improving profitability and margins and expanding our stores domestically and internationally. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nThe Merger\nOn February 14, 2014, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), an entity controlled by Apollo Global Management, LLC ( Apollo\u201d) and its subsidiaries merged with and into CEC Entertainment Inc., with CEC Entertainment Inc. surviving the merger (the Merger\u201d or the Acquisition\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the shares of CEC Entertainment Inc. common stock ceased to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange after close of market on February 14, 2014. The aggregate consideration paid to acquire the Company was $1.4 billion, including the payoff of net debt of $348.0 million and $65.7 million in transaction and debt issuance costs. The Acquisition was funded by (a) $350.0 million of equity contributions from investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo (the Apollo Funds\u201d); (b) $248.5 million of borrowings under a bridge loan facility, which were shortly thereafter repaid using the proceeds from our issuance of $255.0 million of senior notes; and (c) $760.0 million of borrowings under a term loan facility. In addition, we also entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility in connection with the Acquisition, which was undrawn at closing. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d for additional discussion of the senior notes, term loan facility and revolving credit facility.\nAcquisition of Peter Piper Pizza\nOn October 15, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire PPP, a leading pizza and entertainment restaurant chain operating in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, for an aggregate purchase price of $113.1 million, net of cash acquired (the PPP Acquisition\u201d). We completed the PPP Acquisition on October 16, 2014, and funded it with a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction we completed on August 25, 2014 with National Retail Properties, Inc. (the Sale Leaseback\u201d).\n53rd Week Impact\nOur Successor 2015 period (as defined below) consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods, resulting in one additional operating week in the fourth quarter of the Successor 2015 period. The favorable impact to total revenues and company store sales from the additional operating week was approximately $24.7 million, and $24.5 million, respectively. We estimate that the additional operating week benefited the Successor 2015 period net income by approximately $3.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $11.5 million, primarily due to the operating leverage obtained from the additional high sales volume in the 53rd week.\nFiscal 2015 Overview\nIn the following MD&A, we have presented the results of operations and cash flows separately for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 ( Successor 2015 period\u201d), the 317 day period from February 15, 2014 to December 28, 2014 (the Successor 2014 period\u201d), the 47 day period from December 29, 2014 to February 14, 2014 (the Predecessor 2014 period\u201d) and the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 (the Predecessor 2013 period\u201d). The Successor and Predecessor periods have been demarcated by a solid black line.\n \u2022 Total revenues of $922.6 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to total revenues of $718.6 million in the Successor 2014 period and $114.2 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $220.9 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to adjusted EBITDA of $170.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $25.0 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. We estimate our Adjusted EBITDA for 2015, before the impact of the 53rd week, to be approximately $209.4 million. \n \u2022 Net loss of $12.5 million in the Successor 2015 period compared to a net loss of $62.1 million in the Successor 2014 period and net income of $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. \n \u2022 Cash provided by operations was $100.6 million for the Successor 2015 period compared to $48.1 million for the Successor 2014 period and $22.3 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in the Successor 2015 period was primarily driven by an additional week of operations in 2015, transaction, severance and related litigation costs incurred in 2014 in connection with the Merger.

We define comparable store sales\u201d as the percentage change in sales for our domestic Company-owned stores that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or acquired stores we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales is a key performance indicator used within our industry and is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding our average annual comparable store sales and comparable store base:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except store number amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annual sales per comparable store (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of stores included in our comparable store base (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) The information for the Fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 is presented on a 52 week basis. \n (2) Average annual sales per comparable store is calculated based on the average weekly sales of our comparable store base. The amount of average annual sales per comparable store cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable store sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable store base. Additionally, the average annual sales amount for Fiscal 2015 excludes the impact of an additional 53rd week of sales. Including the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015, the average annual sales per comparable store in thousands was $1,607. \n (3) Average annual sales per comparable store and the comparable store base exclude the Peter Piper Pizza branded stores that were acquired in October 2014 as we have operated them for less than 12 months as of the beginning of Fiscal 2015 and 2014.  The PPP Company-owned stores have achieved excellent comparable store sales growth over the past several years. For Fiscal 2015, excluding the 53rd week of operations, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, PPP comparable store sales growth has been 5.2%, 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively. Including the impact of the 53rd week in 2015, the PPP comparable store sales growth for Fiscal 2015 was 7.3%.\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-owned stores ( company store sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play tokens, PlayPass card game credits and merchandise. A portion of our company store sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage and game tokens ( Package Deals\u201d), which we promote through in-store menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. We allocate the revenues recognized from the sale of our Package Deals and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it is sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component is not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, as well as the portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone game token sales, as well as a portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise store's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised stores, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. We recognize development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise store has opened and we have substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a store.\nCompany store operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-owned stores. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\n \u2022 Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers; \n \u2022 Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers, as well as the cost of tickets dispensed to customers; \n \u2022 Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for store personnel; \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are directly related to our Company-owned stores' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment; \n \u2022 Rent expense includes lease costs for Company-owned stores, excluding common occupancy costs (e.g., common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges and property taxes); and \n \u2022 Other store operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, CAM charges, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, store asset disposal gains and losses and all other costs directly related to the operation of a store.  The Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d mentioned above exclude any allocation of (a) store employee payroll, related payroll taxes and benefit costs; (b) depreciation and amortization expense; (c) rent expense; and (d) other direct store operating expenses associated with the operation of our Company-owned stores. We believe that presenting store-level labor costs, depreciation and amortization expense, rent expense and other store operating expenses in the aggregate provides the most informative financial reporting presentation. Our rationale for excluding such costs is as follows:\n \u2022 our store employees are trained to sell and attend to both our dining and entertainment operations. We believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate labor costs between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d; and \n \u2022 while certain assets are individually dedicated to either our food service operations or game activities, we also have significant capital investments in shared depreciating assets, such as leasehold improvements, point-of-sale systems and showroom fixtures. Therefore, we believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate depreciation and amortization expense or rent expense between Cost of Food and beverage sales\u201d and Cost of Entertainment and merchandise sales.\u201d  Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise,\u201d as a percentage of company store sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising and consulting fees, partially offset by contributions from our franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, back-office support systems and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-owned stores.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges for the estimated write down or write-off of the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our stores to their estimated fair value, which are incurred when a store's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the store. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets is similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our senior notes and/or our Secured Credit Facilities (see discussion of our senior notes and Secured Credit Facilities under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information about certain trends, material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. See Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information about Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our principal sources of Total company store sales expressed in dollars and as a percentage of Total company store sales for the periods presented:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 317 Day Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 47 Day Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 3, 2016 (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 14, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and beverage sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entertainment and merchandise sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total company store sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>905,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>712,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Company store sales for the Successor 2014 period include sales from the acquired Peter Piper Pizza stores for the 73 day period from October 17, 2014 through December 28, 2014.

Due to rounding, percentages presented in the table above may not sum to total. The percentage amounts for the components of Cost of food and beverage and the Cost of entertainment and merchandise may not sum to total due to the fact that Cost of food and beverage and Cost of entertainment and merchandise are expressed as a percentage of related Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales, as opposed to Total Company store sales.\nSuccessor 2015 Period (Fiscal 2015) Compared to Successor 2014 Period (317 day period ended December 28, 2014) and Predecessor 2014 Period (47 day period ended February 14, 2014)\nOur 2015 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for the combined Successor and Predecessor 2014 periods. We have estimated the fiscal 2015 operating results on a comparable 52-week basis under the caption 53rd Week Impact.\u201d\nRevenues\nCompany store sales were $905.1 million for the Successor 2015 period compared to $712.1 million for the Successor 2014 period and $113.6 million for the Predecessor 2014 period. Total company store sales in the Successor 2015 period reflect revenues from our Peter Piper stores of $61.4 million, compared to $10.5 million in the Successor 2014 period, and approximately $24.5 million in Company-store sales generated from an additional week of operations in the Successor 2015 period. Before the impact of the extra week of operations in the Successor 2015 period, Chuck E. Cheese's comparable store sales decreased (0.4)% due to a decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2015 followed by three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales growth. Excluding the additional week of operations in 2015, the PPP Company-owned stores achieved comparable store sales growth of 5.2% for the 2015 fiscal year compared to the 2014 fiscal year.\nFranchise fees and royalties were $17.5 million in the Successor 2015 Period compared to $6.5 million in the Successor 2014 period and $0.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The increase in the Successor 2015 period was primarily due to an increase in the number of Chuck E. Cheese's franchise stores and franchise fees and royalties from our PPP franchise stores of $9.2 million.\nCompany Store Operating Costs\nGenerally, company store operating expenses as a percentage of sales benefited from operating leverage associated with the additional week of operations in 2015.\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company store sales, was 15.0% in the Successor 2015 period compared to 14.7% in the Successor 2014 period and 14.1% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 and Successor 2014 periods include the addition of PPP Company-owned stores, which have higher cost margins than our existing Chuck E. Cheese's Company-owned stores due to the higher mix of food and beverage at our PPP Company-owned stores.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were 27.7% in the Successor 2015 period, 28.2% in the Successor 2014 period and 28.2% in the Predecessor 2014 period. The Successor 2015 period reflects improved labor management offset by an increase in minimum wage rates in certain states over the past year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $115.2 million in the Successor 2015 period, $116.0 million in the Successor 2014 period and $9.7 million in the Predecessor 2014 period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in the Successor 2015 period is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense during the Successor 2014 period from certain property, plant and equipment assets that were assigned short useful lives from the acquisition method of accounting as a result of the Merger, partially offset by a full year's depreciation of the property, plant and"}
