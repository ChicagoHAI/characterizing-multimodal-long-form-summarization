Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2018, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in theatre advertising. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2018 included Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Aquaman, Deadpool 2, Dr. Seuss' The Grinch, Mission Impossible - Fallout, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Venom, A Quiet Place, Crazy Rich Asians, Halloween, Bumblebee, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mary Poppins Returns, A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and other films, as well as the carryover of The Greatest Showman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2019 include Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, The Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Captain Marvel, It 2, Spider-Man: Far From Home, The Secret Life of Pets 2, Joker, Dumbo and Godzilla 2 among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and renovated theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs, maintenance and security services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nOur patrons often have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when sales are made at the registers. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as current liabilities. Revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as current liabilities and record admissions revenues as the credits are redeemed for movie tickets. We also have loyalty programs in many of our locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as liabilities based on the number of reward points issued to the customer and recognize revenues when the customer redeems such points.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nChanges to the way in which we recognize revenue resulted in the following impacts to our consolidated statements of income:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> a)\n</td> <td> Recording of incremental other revenue and interest expense related to the significant financing component of our Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d) with NCM, LLC ( NCM\u201d).

To determine the amount of revenues to defer upon issuance of points to customers under our points-based loyalty programs, we estimated the values of the rewards expected to be redeemed by our customers for those points. The estimates are based on the rewards that have historically been offered under the loyalty programs, which we believe is representative of the rewards to be offered in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> c)\n</td> <td> Increase in other revenues and an increase in utilities and other costs due to the presentation of transactional fees on a gross versus net basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> d)\n</td> <td> Increase in other revenues due to the change in amortization methodology for deferred revenue - NCM that is now amortized on a straight-line basis and effective for the entire term of the ESA. The deferred revenue - NCM is related to our ESA and Common Unit Adjustment agreement with NCM, under which our performance obligation is to provide NCM with exclusive access to its domestic theatres for purposes of in-theatre advertising over the term of the ESA. Such exclusivity, and therefore the satisfaction of our performance obligation, is provided to NCM evenly over time. As a result of the change in amortization method, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of $40,526, net of taxes, in retained earnings on January 1, 2018. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> actual theatre level cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> budgeted theatre level cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> theatre property and equipment carrying values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amortizing intangible asset carrying values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the age of a recently built theatre;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competitive theatres in the marketplace;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of recent ticket price changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> available lease renewal options; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2016, 2017 and 2018. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017 and 2018. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment\nincludes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for all reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2016. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%, with the exception of one reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a quantitative tradename impairment assessment for our tradename in Ecuador and performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis for all other tradename intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, which included (1) reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, (2) generally eliminated U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign\nsubsidiaries, (3) a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the amounts recorded for the Tax Act are final for the 2017 transition tax, the re-measurement of deferred taxes, and our reassessment of valuation allowances.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the earliest period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). ASU 2018-11 provides an additional transition method to adopt ASU 2016-02. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. This additional transition method changes only when an entity is required to initially apply the transition requirements outlined in ASU 2016-02; it does not change how those requirements are applied. We used the transition method outlined in ASU 2018-11 upon adoption.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 and the related amendments in ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 (collectively referred to herein as the New Leasing Standard\u201d) effective January 1, 2019. We are finalizing our evaluation of the impact of the New Leasing Standard on our consolidated financial statements, and expect the most significant impacts to be as follows:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> We will recognize liabilities representing the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments for all of its operating leases as of January 1, 2019. We estimate these liabilities will be between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> We will recognize right of use assets for all of our operating leases equal to the liabilities calculated in (1) above, adjusted for the balances of long-term prepaid rent, favorable lease intangible assets, deferred lease expense, unfavorable lease liabilities and deferred lease incentive liabilities as of January 1, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> We have theatre leases in which we were involved in construction that failed sale-leaseback accounting at the end of the construction period. These leases, which were accounted for as capital leases, will be derecognized upon adoption of the New Leasing Standard and evaluated to determine classification upon adoption. Some of these leases will be classified as operating leases upon adoption and, beginning in 2019, lease payments for these leases will be recorded as facility lease expense on the consolidated income statement. Previously, as capital leases, lease payments were classified as interest expense and reductions of the capital lease obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>

Utilities and other costs increased to $327.0 million for 2018 from $241.6 million for 2017. The increase was primarily due to the presentation of transactional fees on a gross basis versus net basis (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $177.2 million ($202.6 million in constant currency), or 47.5% of admissions revenues, for 2018 compared to $210.1 million, or 48.0% of admissions revenues, for 2017. The decrease in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to higher advertising costs during 2017. Concession supplies expense was $46.4 million ($52.2 million in constant currency), or 21.4% of concession revenues, for 2018 compared to $53.5 million, or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and wages decreased to $80.2 million (increased to $94.1 million in constant currency) for 2018 from $88.7 million for 2017. The as reported decrease was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased local currency wages that were primarily driven by inflation, new theatres and limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations. Facility lease expense decreased to $78.2 million (increased to $87.3 million in constant currency) for 2018 from $87.2 million for 2017. The as reported decrease was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate and lower percentage rent due to the decline in revenues, partially offset by an increase in base rent due to new theatres. Utilities and other costs increased to $121.0 million ($140.6 million in constant currency) for 2018 from $113.4 million for 2017. The as reported increase was primarily due to the presentation of transactional fees on a gross basis versus net basis (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $162.6 million for 2018 from $151.0 million for 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support strategic initiatives, increased benefits costs and professional fees, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $261.2 million for 2018 compared to $237.5 million for 2017. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to theatre remodels, including Luxury Lounger conversions, and new theatres.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $32.4 million for 2018 compared to $15.1 million for 2017. Impairment charges for 2018 consisted of theatre properties in nine of our U.S. regions, Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Peru. Impairment charges for 2017 consisted of theatre properties in eleven of our U.S. regions, Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala and Curacao. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on disposal of assets and other of $38.7 million during 2018 compared to $22.8 million during 2017. The loss recorded during 2018 was primarily due to the retirement of assets related to theatre remodels, including Luxury Lounger conversions, and the accrual of reserves for outstanding litigation (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). The loss recorded during 2017 included the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures and the write-off of a favorable lease intangible asset due to the amendment of a theatre lease, partially offset by gains related to the sale of excess land parcels and a gain on a landlord buyout of a theatre lease.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $110.0 million for 2018 compared to $105.9 million for 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the variable rate at which our term loan accrued interest during 2018. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt and our interest rate swap agreements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss). We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $11.7 million during 2018 and a foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million during 2017 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from original transaction dates until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $1.5 million during 2018 related to amendments to our senior secured credit facility that included a reduction in the interest rate at which our term loan accrues interest and to reduce the amount of real property required to be mortgaged to secure the loans. We recorded a loss of $0.5 million during 2017 related to amendments to our senior secured credit facility that included a reduction in the interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving credit line, revisions to certain definitions within the agreement, and an extension of the maturity of the revolving credit line. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $15.4 million during 2018 and $16.4 million during 2017, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense - NCM. We recorded non-cash interest expense of $19.7 million during 2018 related to the significant financing component associated with revenues collected in advance under certain of our agreements with NCM. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of ASC Topic 606.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $39.2 million during 2018 and $36.0 million during 2017. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $96.0 million was recorded for 2018 compared to $80.3 million recorded for 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 30.7% and included a net additional charge, as a result of the Tax Act and its recently issued guidance, of $19.2 million, all non-cash. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 23.1%, which included the impact of a one-time benefit of $44.9 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our income tax expense and tax reform.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nRevenues. Total revenues increased $72.8 million to $2,991.6 million for 2017 from $2,918.8 million for 2016, representing a 2.5% increase.

Utilities and other costs decreased to $241.6 million for 2017 from $250.9 million for the 2016 period.

Facility lease expense increased to $87.2 million ($84.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $80.6 million for 2016. The as reported increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate and new theatres. Utilities and other costs increased to $113.4 million ($111.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $105.0 million for 2016. The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increases in repairs and maintenance expenses and utility expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $151.0 million for 2017 from $140.6 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries and wages partially due to inflation, professional fees and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $237.5 million for 2017 compared to $209.1 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to theatre remodels and new theatres.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $15.1 million for 2017 compared to $2.8 million for 2016. Impairment charges for 2017 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala and Curacao, impacting fifteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on disposal of assets and other of $22.8 million during 2017 compared to $20.4 million during 2016. The loss recorded during 2017 included the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures and the write-off of a favorable lease intangible asset due to the amendment of a theatre lease, partially offset by gains related to the sale of excess land parcels and a gain on a landlord buyout of a theatre lease. The loss recorded during 2016 included the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $105.9 million for 2017 compared to $108.3 million for 2016. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the 4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016, as well as amendments to our senior secured credit facility completed during June and December of 2016 and June of 2017, which, in the aggregate, reduced the rate at which our term loan accrues interest by 100 basis points. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain. We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million during 2017 and a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $0.5 million during 2017 related to amendments to our senior secured credit facility that included a reduction in the interest rate at which our term loan accrues interest, revisions to certain definitions within the agreement, a reduction of the interest rates applicable to the revolving credit line and an extension of the maturity of the revolving credit line. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $16.4 million during 2017 and $14.7 million during 2016, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $36.0 million during 2017 and $32.0 million during 2016. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $80.3 million was recorded for 2017 compared to $104.9 million recorded for 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 23.1%, which included the impact of a one-time benefit of $44.9 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.9%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating Activities\nWe primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. In addition, our theatres provide the patron a choice of using a credit card or debit card. Since our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating float\u201d and historically have not\nrequired traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $462.3 million, $528.4 million and $556.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the amount and timing of vendor payments for movies released during December of those years.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings, remodels and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $327.8 million, $410.5 million and $451.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The increase in cash used for investing activities during 2017 was primarily due to increases in capital expenditures and acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities during 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of NCM common units (see Note 4) for $78.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> New\nTheatres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Existing\nTheatres (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 326.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 346.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 include approximately $3.9, $9.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the remodel of our corporate headquarters building.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we had an average of 89, 148 and 72 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.\nOur U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 341 theatres with 4,586 screens as of December 31, 2018. We built three new theatres and 32 screens and closed one theatre with 7 screens during the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had signed commitments to open six new theatres and 70 screens in domestic markets during 2019 and open five new theatres with 54 screens subsequent to 2019. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 124 domestic screens will be approximately $80 million.\nOur international theatre circuit consisted of 205 theatres with 1,462 screens as of December 31, 2018. We built eight new theatres and 49 screens, acquired three theatres with 19 screens and closed four screens during the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had signed commitments to open eight new theatres and 59 screens in international markets during 2019 and open two new theatres and 29 screens subsequent to 2019. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 88 international screens will be approximately $52 million.\nActual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities was $163.1 million, $157.4 million and $191.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Cash used for financing activities primarily consists of dividends paid to our parent company, Cinemark Holdings, Inc..\nWe may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 (in millions):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 659.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 5.125% senior notes due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 755.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 755.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,817.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,809.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,810.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,801.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Debt discounts and debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, less current portion, net of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,780.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,772.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to a letter of credit outstanding, we had $98.8 million in available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit line.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt obligations, scheduled interest payments on long-term debt, future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, scheduled interest payments under capital leases and other obligations for each period indicated are summarized as follows:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 -

Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US Prime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was $652.9 million outstanding under the term loan. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $98.8 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line, after giving effect to a letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2018 was approximately 4.4% per annum.\nCinemark USA, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and the guarantors' personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.'s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries' and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement, not to exceed 5.0 to 1. As of December 31, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc.'s actual ratio was 2.9 to 1.\nThe dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.'s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,918.1 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc.\nWe have three interest rate swap agreements that are used to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2018, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in theatre advertising. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2018 included Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Aquaman, Deadpool 2, Dr. Seuss' The Grinch, Mission Impossible - Fallout, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Venom, A Quiet Place, Crazy Rich Asians, Halloween, Bumblebee, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mary Poppins Returns, A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and other films, as well as the carryover of The Greatest Showman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2019 include Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, The Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Captain Marvel, It 2, Spider-Man: Far From Home, The Secret Life of Pets 2, Joker, Dumbo and Godzilla 2 among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and renovated theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs, maintenance and security services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nOur patrons often have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when sales are made at the registers. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as current liabilities. Revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as current liabilities and record admissions revenues as the credits are redeemed for movie tickets. We also have loyalty programs in many of our locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as liabilities based on the number of reward points issued to the customer and recognize revenues when the customer redeems such points.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nChanges to the way in which we recognize revenue resulted in the following impacts to our consolidated statements of income:\n a) Recording of incremental other revenue and interest expense related to the significant financing component of our Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d) with NCM, LLC ( NCM\u201d). See further discussion at Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. \n b) Deferral of a portion of admissions and concession revenues for transactions that include the issuance of loyalty points to customers. To determine the amount of revenues to defer upon issuance of points to customers under our points-based loyalty programs, we estimated the values of the rewards expected to be redeemed by our customers for those points. The estimates are based on the rewards that have historically been offered under the loyalty programs, which we believe is representative of the rewards to be offered in the future. \n c) Increase in other revenues and an increase in utilities and other costs due to the presentation of transactional fees on a gross versus net basis. \n d) Increase in other revenues due to the change in amortization methodology for deferred revenue - NCM that is now amortized on a straight-line basis and effective for the entire term of the ESA. The deferred revenue - NCM is related to our ESA and Common Unit Adjustment agreement with NCM, under which our performance obligation is to provide NCM with exclusive access to its domestic theatres for purposes of in-theatre advertising over the term of the ESA. Such exclusivity, and therefore the satisfaction of our performance obligation, is provided to NCM evenly over time. As a result of the change in amortization method, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of $40,526, net of taxes, in retained earnings on January 1, 2018. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 theatre property and equipment carrying values; \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n \u2022 the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; \n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2016, 2017 and 2018. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017 and 2018. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment\nincludes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for all reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2016. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%, with the exception of one reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a quantitative tradename impairment assessment for our tradename in Ecuador and performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis for all other tradename intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, which included (1) reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, (2) generally eliminated U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign\nsubsidiaries, (3) a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the amounts recorded for the Tax Act are final for the 2017 transition tax, the re-measurement of deferred taxes, and our reassessment of valuation allowances.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the earliest period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). ASU 2018-11 provides an additional transition method to adopt ASU 2016-02. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. This additional transition method changes only when an entity is required to initially apply the transition requirements outlined in ASU 2016-02; it does not change how those requirements are applied. We used the transition method outlined in ASU 2018-11 upon adoption.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 and the related amendments in ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 (collectively referred to herein as the New Leasing Standard\u201d) effective January 1, 2019. We are finalizing our evaluation of the impact of the New Leasing Standard on our consolidated financial statements, and expect the most significant impacts to be as follows:\n 1. We will recognize liabilities representing the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments for all of its operating leases as of January 1, 2019. We estimate these liabilities will be between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion. \n 2. We will recognize right of use assets for all of our operating leases equal to the liabilities calculated in (1) above, adjusted for the balances of long-term prepaid rent, favorable lease intangible assets, deferred lease expense, unfavorable lease liabilities and deferred lease incentive liabilities as of January 1, 2019. \n 3. We have theatre leases in which we were involved in construction that failed sale-leaseback accounting at the end of the construction period. These leases, which were accounted for as capital leases, will be derecognized upon adoption of the New Leasing Standard and evaluated to determine classification upon adoption. Some of these leases will be classified as operating leases upon adoption and, beginning in 2019, lease payments for these leases will be recorded as facility lease expense on the consolidated income statement. Previously, as capital leases, lease payments were classified as interest expense and reductions of the capital lease obligations. \n 4. For the capital leases derecognized as discussed in (3) above, we will write-off the net book value of the capital lease asset and capital lease liability, with the difference between those amounts resulting in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2018, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in theatre advertising. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2018 included Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Aquaman, Deadpool 2, Dr. Seuss' The Grinch, Mission Impossible - Fallout, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Venom, A Quiet Place, Crazy Rich Asians, Halloween, Bumblebee, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mary Poppins Returns, A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and other films, as well as the carryover of The Greatest Showman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\nFilms scheduled for release during 2019 include Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, The Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Captain Marvel, It 2, Spider-Man: Far From Home, The Secret Life of Pets 2, Joker, Dumbo and Godzilla 2 among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and renovated theatres, loyalty and membership programs and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues and product mix. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital and finance leases and the number of owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs, maintenance and security services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consist of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, consulting fees, legal fees, audit fees, supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nOur patrons often have the option to purchase movie tickets well in advance of a movie showtime or right before the movie showtime, or at any point in between those two timeframes depending on seat availability. We recognize such admissions revenues when the showtime for a purchased movie ticket has passed. Concession revenues are recognized when sales are made at the registers. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We sell gift cards and discount ticket vouchers, the proceeds from which are recorded as current liabilities. Revenues for gift cards and discount ticket vouchers are recognized when they are redeemed for movie tickets or concession items. We offer a subscription program in the U.S. whereby patrons can pay a monthly fee to receive a monthly credit for use towards a future movie ticket purchase. We record the monthly subscription program fees as current liabilities and record admissions revenues as the credits are redeemed for movie tickets. We also have loyalty programs in many of our locations that either have a prepaid annual membership fee or award points to customers as purchases are made. For those loyalty programs that have an annual membership fee, we recognize the fee collected as other revenues over the term of the membership. For those loyalty programs that award points to customers based on their purchases, we record a portion of the original transaction proceeds as liabilities based on the number of reward points issued to the customer and recognize revenues when the customer redeems such points.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers. We adopted ASC Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method.\nChanges to the way in which we recognize revenue resulted in the following impacts to our consolidated statements of income:\n a) Recording of incremental other revenue and interest expense related to the significant financing component of our Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d) with NCM, LLC ( NCM\u201d). See further discussion at Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. \n b) Deferral of a portion of admissions and concession revenues for transactions that include the issuance of loyalty points to customers. To determine the amount of revenues to defer upon issuance of points to customers under our points-based loyalty programs, we estimated the values of the rewards expected to be redeemed by our customers for those points. The estimates are based on the rewards that have historically been offered under the loyalty programs, which we believe is representative of the rewards to be offered in the future. \n c) Increase in other revenues and an increase in utilities and other costs due to the presentation of transactional fees on a gross versus net basis. \n d) Increase in other revenues due to the change in amortization methodology for deferred revenue - NCM that is now amortized on a straight-line basis and effective for the entire term of the ESA. The deferred revenue - NCM is related to our ESA and Common Unit Adjustment agreement with NCM, under which our performance obligation is to provide NCM with exclusive access to its domestic theatres for purposes of in-theatre advertising over the term of the ESA. Such exclusivity, and therefore the satisfaction of our performance obligation, is provided to NCM evenly over time. As a result of the change in amortization method, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of $40,526, net of taxes, in retained earnings on January 1, 2018. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n \u2022 theatre property and equipment carrying values; \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n \u2022 the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; \n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the remaining lease period, which includes the probability of the exercise of available renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2016, 2017 and 2018. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its twenty regions in the U.S. and seven of its international countries with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Under ASC Topic 350, Goodwill, Intangibles and Other ( ASC Topic 350\u201d), we may perform a qualitative impairment assessment or a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill.\nA quantitative analysis requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017 and 2018. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. A qualitative assessment\nincludes consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors, and a review of current carrying values compared to estimated fair values as determined during our most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for all reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2016. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment for three new domestic reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%, with the exception of one reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9%. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the assessments performed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Under ASC Topic 350, we can elect to perform a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment for our tradename intangible assets. A quantitative tradename impairment assessment includes comparing the carrying values of tradename assets to an estimated fair value. Fair values are estimated by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. A qualitative assessment considers our historical and forecasted revenues and changes in estimated royalty rates, and a comparison of current carrying values to estimated fair values from our most recent quantitative assessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a quantitative tradename impairment assessment for our tradename in Ecuador and performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis for all other tradename intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative tradename impairment evaluations for all tradename assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed a qualitative tradename impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis performed during each year, no impairment charges were recorded related to tradename intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, which included (1) reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, (2) generally eliminated U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign\nsubsidiaries, (3) a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the amounts recorded for the Tax Act are final for the 2017 transition tax, the re-measurement of deferred taxes, and our reassessment of valuation allowances.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, we entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA\u201d), with NCM pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, we amended our operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and our sale of certain of shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay us a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Developments\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASC Topic 606\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.\nImpact of New Lease Accounting Standard\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the earliest period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases ( ASU 2018-10\u201d). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d). ASU 2018-11 provides an additional transition method to adopt ASU 2016-02. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. This additional transition method changes only when an entity is required to initially apply the transition requirements outlined in ASU 2016-02; it does not change how those requirements are applied. We used the transition method outlined in ASU 2018-11 upon adoption.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842 and the related amendments in ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 (collectively referred to herein as the New Leasing Standard\u201d) effective January 1, 2019. We are finalizing our evaluation of the impact of the New Leasing Standard on our consolidated financial statements, and expect the most significant impacts to be as follows:\n 1. We will recognize liabilities representing the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments for all of its operating leases as of January 1, 2019. We estimate these liabilities will be between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion. \n 2. We will recognize right of use assets for all of our operating leases equal to the liabilities calculated in (1) above, adjusted for the balances of long-term prepaid rent, favorable lease intangible assets, deferred lease expense, unfavorable lease liabilities and deferred lease incentive liabilities as of January 1, 2019. \n 3. We have theatre leases in which we were involved in construction that failed sale-leaseback accounting at the end of the construction period. These leases, which were accounted for as capital leases, will be derecognized upon adoption of the New Leasing Standard and evaluated to determine classification upon adoption. Some of these leases will be classified as operating leases upon adoption and, beginning in 2019, lease payments for these leases will be recorded as facility lease expense on the consolidated income statement. Previously, as capital leases, lease payments were classified as interest expense and reductions of the capital lease obligations. \n 4. For the capital leases derecognized as discussed in (3) above, we will write-off the net book value of the capital lease asset and capital lease liability, with the difference between those amounts resulting in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating data (in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Admissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,789.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,795.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,834.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Concession\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 990.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,038.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,108.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,918.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
