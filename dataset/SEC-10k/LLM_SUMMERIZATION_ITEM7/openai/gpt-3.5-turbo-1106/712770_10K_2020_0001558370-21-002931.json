Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on acquiring, owning and managing a geographically diversified portfolio of industrial, retail (including furniture stores and supermarkets), restaurant, health and fitness and theater properties, many of which are subject to long-term leases. Most of our leases are net leases\u201d under which the tenant, directly or indirectly, is responsible for paying the real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs of the property. As of December 31, 2020, we own, in 31 states, 123 properties, including four properties owned by consolidated joint ventures and three properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe most significant challenge we faced in 2020, and the significant uncertainties we face in the near term, are the direct and indirect economic and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses thereto. The pandemic had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the global economy, the U.S. economy, and the economies of the local markets in which our properties are located. The preventative measures taken to address the pandemic, and the economic consequences resulting therefrom, have affected, and will continue to affect, our tenants to varying degrees depending on, among other things, the location of the subject property and the nature of the tenant and use of the property (i.e., industrial or non-industrial), with retail (both general and specialized), theater, health and fitness, and restaurant properties having been and continuing to be significantly adversely affected.\nThe pandemic and the current economic, financial, and capital markets environments present material risks and uncertainties. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the pandemic and the continuing economic slowdown will have on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, which will depend largely on future developments relating, among other things, to the duration and scope of the pandemic, efforts to boost the economy, the timing and strength of an economic recovery, if any, and other factors outside of our control. If the pandemic and economic slowdown continue for an extended period, among other things,\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tenants, and in particular, tenants in the retail, restaurant, theater and health and fitness sectors, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us (including obligations under deferral arrangements or extended leases) and may seek additional rent relief, may choose not to renew their leases, or if they renew, may do so on terms less favorable to us, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> it is more likely that tenants that to date have only been minimally impacted will be significantly and adversely effected, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> the amounts tenants at challenged properties pay us may be insufficient, without an accommodation from the mortgage lender at such properties, to pay our debt service obligations with respect to such properties, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the mortgage lenders for challenged properties may be unwilling or unable to allow for accommodations or further accommodations with respect to our debt service obligations at such properties, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the transformation of the retail, restaurant, health and fitness and theater sectors toward the provision by these sectors of goods and services through e-commerce distribution channels at the expense of the bricks and mortar distribution channels, may continue to grow at an accelerating rate, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>it may be more difficult to obtain equity and debt financing, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>it may be more difficult to acquire properties to grow our business and dispose of underperforming assets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, ability to service our debt, and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, may be adversely affected upon the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing. The risks, uncertainties and challenges presented by the pandemic and the economic slowdown may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, challenges and uncertainties described in this report.\nDeferrals and Abatements; Addressing Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe summarize below certain information, as of December 31, 2020 (unless otherwise indicated), regarding the impact of the pandemic on our business and our responses thereto. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the accounting treatment afforded to abatements and deferrals of rental payments.\nWe deferred the payment of an aggregate of approximately $3.5 million, or 4.8%, of the annual base rent otherwise payable during 2020. Of such sum, $1.6 million, or 47.0%, is payable by four tenants at 16 properties. Of the total $3.5 million deferral, approximately 14.2% was repaid in 2020 and 79.6%, 5.9% and 0.3% are to be paid in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. These deferrals do not (i) modify or defer tenant obligations to reimburse us for property level operating expenses and (ii) affect our net income, funds from operations or adjusted funds from operations; however, they reduced cash available for acquisitions, operations and dividends. We may grant, as circumstances require, rent deferrals in addition to those described in this report.\nThe abatements we agreed to reduced for 2020 (before giving effect to the impact of lease extensions on straight-line rent as described below) rental income by $1.4 million. For seven tenants, we linked a rent abatement to a lease extension (and for another tenant, reduced the lease term and the base rent payable) at a property. As a result of the abatements coupled with the modified lease term,\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the aggregate base rent payable beginning January 1, 2021 by these eight tenants over the modified lease term increased by $16.3 million over the amount payable prior to such abatement/lease modification, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td>

Generally, based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants, we monitor a tenant's financial condition through one or more of the following actions: reviewing tenant financial statements or other financial information, obtaining other tenant related information, regular contact with tenant's representatives, tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants. We may sell a property if the tenant's financial condition is unsatisfactory.\nWe monitor, on an ongoing basis, our expiring leases and generally approach tenants with expiring leases (including those subject to renewal options) at least a year prior to lease expiration to determine their interest in renewing their leases. In 2021 and 2022, 31 tenants with 34 leases for 28 properties representing $15.6 million, or 22.6%, of 2021 contractual rental income expire. The following table provides information, as of December 31, 2020, regarding the leases that expire in 2021 and 2022 (with respect to the multi-tenant shopping centers in Royersford, Pennsylvania and Lakewood, Colorado, which have both retail and restaurant tenants, we have allocated the property count and associated mortgage debt to the retail (and not restaurant) categories because these are mixed-use properties):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease Term to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 Rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity (months)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 49,384\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail (2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,861\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health & Fitness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Theater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 104,245\n</td> </tr>\n</table> ______________\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>In 2020 and 2019, the rental income reflected above of $71.4 million and $73.4 million, respectively, excludes tenant reimbursement income of $10.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>(2) </td> <td>Retail, reflected above, includes our Retail-Furniture, Retail-Supermarket and Retail-Office Supply sectors. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>(3) </td> <td>Haverty Furniture leases eleven of these properties. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are negotiating lease extensions with respect to several properties that account for at least 7.0% of 2021 contractual rental income and at which the lease(s) expire in 2022. We anticipate that if such arrangements are finalized, as to which no assurance can be given, (i) we will extend the leases for several properties for periods ranging from four years to nine years, (ii) a lease for at least one of these properties will not be renewed, and (iii) we will expend an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million from 2021 through 2023 for capital improvements and transaction costs at several of these properties. As a result of the foregoing and other accommodations that may be provided in connection with renewing the leases at these properties, we anticipate that the base rent and cash flow from operations generated by the properties that are re-leased will decrease beginning in late 2022 from that currently generated by all of such properties. If other significant tenants with leases expiring in 2021 and 2022 choose not to renew their leases or negotiate for renewals on terms less favorable to us than currently in effect, we may be adversely affected due to the reduction in base rents received and the expenses associated with maintaining vacant properties.\nIn acquiring properties, we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired, which analysis takes into account, among other things, the estimated value of the property, local demographics and the ability to re-rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination.\nWe are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry as a result of the growth of e-commerce. Over the past several years, we have been addressing our exposure to the retail industry by focusing on acquiring industrial properties (including warehouse and distribution facilities) and properties that we believe capitalize on e-commerce activities - since September 2016, we have not acquired any retail properties and have sold 13 retail properties. As a result of the focus on industrial properties and the sale of retail properties, retail properties generated 32.9%, 35.2%, 41.9% and 43.7%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and industrial properties generated 55.4%, 48.7%, 40.1% and 35.1%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have variable rate debt in the principal amount of $97.7 million (i.e., $84.7 million of mortgage debt and $13.0 million of credit facility debt) that bear interest at the one month LIBOR rate plus a negotiated spread. This mortgage debt is hedged through interest rate swaps and the credit facility debt is not hedged. The authority regulating LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the circulation of LIBOR after June 2023 and it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable at an earlier date. As approximately $68.7 million of this mortgage debt and the related notional amount of the interest rate swaps mature after June 2023, there is uncertainty as to how the interest rate on this variable rate debt and the related swaps will be determined when LIBOR is unavailable.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Facing Certain Tenants and Properties\nSet forth below is a description of the challenges and uncertainties facing certain tenants or properties:\nRegal Cinemas\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Regal Cinemas is a tenant at three properties, including a property owned by an unconsolidated joint venture.

In 2020, we, among other things, (i) wrote-off, as reduction to rental income, $1.1 million of the tenant's unbilled rent receivable, (ii) did not collect and did not accrue $928,000 of the rent due principally for September through December 2020, and (iii) abated rent of $676,000. At December 31, 2020, our Indianapolis, Indiana property had mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities and intangible lease assets of approximately $4.0 million, $654,000 and $832,000, respectively. There is no mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities or intangible lease assets at our Greensboro, North Carolina property at which we lease the underlying fee and in turn lease the property to Regal Cinemas. We estimate that the carrying costs for these properties for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021 are approximately $725,000, including real estate taxes of approximately $337,000 and debt service of $184,000. Regal Cinemas is the primary obligor with respect to $541,000 of such costs and we are only responsible with respect to such amount if it is not paid by Regal Cinemas. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a Regal Cinemas theater is a tenant at a multi-tenant property located in Manahawkin, New Jersey and which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture.

In connection with these accommodations, the tenant agreed to extend the lease at one property for five years which, due to the effect of straight-line rent, we estimate will contribute an additional $24,000 annually to rental income. This tenant paid base rent of $2.4 million and $3.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we anticipate that they will pay base rent of $3.4 million in 2021 (including $133,000 of deferral repayments). At December 31, 2020, the mortgage debt, unbilled rent receivable, intangible lease assets and intangible lease liabilities with respect to these properties was $12.5 million, $1.4 million, $523,000 and $36,000, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Vue - Beachwood, Ohio\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>A multi-family complex, which we refer to as The Vue, ground leases from us the underlying land located in Beachwood, Ohio. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the owner/operator of the property paid us $729,000, $783,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, of rental income, all of which was variable rent. For the past several years, the property has faced, and we anticipate that for at least the next several months, if not longer, the property will continue to face, occupancy, financial and litigation challenges. For the past several months, the property, after giving effect to mortgage payments, has operated on a negative cash flow basis, and we anticipate that it will continue to operate on a negative cash flow basis for at least the next several months, if not longer. The tenant has not paid the aggregate $486,000 of rent owed from October 2020 through March 2021 and we do not anticipate that the tenant will resume making rental payments for the next several months, if not longer. In November 2020, the ground lease was amended to require, among other things, that the owner/operator deposit $1.2 million to pay certain past due operating expenses and a portion of anticipated future operating cash flow shortfalls at the property as well as $170,000 to pay a portion of the capital expenditures required at the property (all of which sums have been deposited). We agreed, subject to our discretion, to fund 78% of (i) any further operating expense shortfalls at the property after the $1.2 million operating expense deposit has been fully utilized, and (ii) capital expenditures required at the property. (We estimate that the property currently requires capital expenditures of $700,000 to $1.2 million). During the first quarter of 2021 (through March 4, 2021), we provided The Vue with $409,000 to cover, among other things, (i) the anticipated operating cash flow shortfalls for February and March 2021 and (ii) capital expenditures for November 2020 through January 2021. At December 31, 2020, (i) there are no unbilled rent receivables, intangibles or tenant origination costs associated with this property and (ii) the net book value of our land subject to this ground lease is $13.9 million and is subordinate to $67.2 million of mortgage debt incurred by the owner/operator. If the tenant does not resume making monthly rental payments, ceases paying its mortgage obligations, or, if pursuant to the ground lease amendment, we fund additional capital expenditures or operating expense shortfalls at the property, our cash flow will be adversely impacted. See \"- Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUpdate as to Status of Tenants that filed for Bankruptcy in 2020\nIn our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, we reported that four tenants leasing ten properties had filed for bankruptcy protection from May through August 2020. As of February 28, 2021, these tenants or their respective affiliates, NPC International, a Wendy's franchisee that, among other things, operates more than 385 Wendy's restaurants, CEC Entertainment, Inc., the operator of Chuck E Cheese restaurants, Tuesday Morning Corporation, a Nasdaq listed retailer specializing in home products, and Tailored Brands, the parent of Men's Wearhouse, had exited bankruptcy. With respect to these four tenants, we estimate that after giving effect to lease amendments entered into in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, total base rent and rental income will (i) decrease by approximately $177,000 and $292,000, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2021 and (ii) increase by approximately $897,000 and $128,000, respectively, from January 1, 2021 through the expiration (without giving effect to any extension options) of the applicable leases.\nRe-development of the Manahawkin Property\nWe are re-developing the Manahawkin Property, which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% equity interest. As a result of this re-development activity and the related decrease in occupancy, and more recently, the failure of Regal Cinemas, a significant tenant at this property, to pay rent, the income and cash flow from this property decreased significantly over the past several years and the property's carrying costs (including debt service payments) exceed the operating cash flow generated therefrom. Because of, among other things, the (i) decrease in rent, (ii) possibility that co-tenancy clauses could be triggered if certain significant tenants vacate or otherwise cease operations, (iii) possibility that tenants that have informally agreed to participate in the re-development, in light of, among other things, the challenges facing the retail environment, may determine not to participate and (iv) anticipated difficulty in obtaining financing for the project and the anticipated delay in completing the re-development, there is uncertainty as to if and when the re-development will be completed. If Regal Cinemas does not continue paying rent as agreed to in February 2021 (see -Regal Cinemas\u201d above) or the re-development is not completed on a timely basis, our net income, cash flow and financial condition may be adversely affected. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nRound Rock Guaranty Litigation\nIn 2019, we sued the guarantor of the lease at our former property in Round Rock, Texas, which we refer to as the Round Rock Property\u201d, at which the tenant obtained bankruptcy protection and terminated its lease. (The lawsuit is captioned: OLP Wyoming Springs, LLC, Plaintiff, v. Harden Healthcare, LLC, Defendant, v Benjamin Hanson, Intervenor, District Court of Williamson County, Texas, Cause No. 18-1511-C368). The trial court granted our motion for summary judgment determining that the lease guarantor is liable under its guaranty. Our damage assessment asserts mitigated damages in excess of $14 million and the lease guarantor asserts that it is not liable for any damages, and that if the court determines it is liable for damages, the damages would range from $1.0 million to $5.6 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expense in connection with this lawsuit and cannot provide any assurance that we will realize any recovery therefrom.\n2020 and Recent Developments\nIn 2020:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our rental income, net, decreased by $1.9 million, or 2.3%, from 2019; the net decrease is due to the pandemic and the direct and indirect economic consequences thereof which resulted in, among other things, the abatement of rent, the write-off of unbilled rent receivables and the inability to collect certain rent. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we acquired two industrial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $28.3 million.

FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. In computing FFO, we do not add back to net income the amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non-real estate assets.\nWe compute adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, by adjusting from FFO for our straight-line rent accruals and amortization of lease intangibles, deducting lease termination fees and adding back amortization of restricted stock and restricted stock unit compensation expense, amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities (including our share of our unconsolidated joint ventures), income on insurance recoveries from casualties and debt prepayment costs. Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another.\nWe believe that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values\nhave historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, we believe that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that when compared year over year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. We also consider FFO and AFFO to be useful to us in evaluating potential property acquisitions.\nFFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance; nor should FFO and AFFO be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders.\nManagement recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating our performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income in accordance with GAAP to FFO and AFFO for the years indicated:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

company, this comparison is omitted in accordance with Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of liquidity and capital include cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our credit facility, refinancing existing mortgage loans, obtaining mortgage loans secured by our unencumbered properties, issuance of our equity securities and property sales. In 2020, we obtained $18.2 million of proceeds from mortgage financings, approximately $16.5 million of net proceeds from property sales (after giving effect to repayment of mortgage debt and debt prepayment costs and excluding the $4.6 million purchase money mortgage received on the sale of the Houston, Texas properties) and paid $6.8 million of dividends through the issuance of our stock. Our available liquidity at March 4, 2021 was approximately $75.1 million, including approximately $8.7 million of cash and cash equivalents (including the credit facility's required $3.0 million average deposit maintenance balance) and, subject to borrowing base requirements, up to $66.4 million available under our credit facility.\nLiquidity and Financing\nWe expect to meet our (i) operating cash requirements (including debt service and anticipated dividend payments) principally from cash flow from operations, our available cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from and, to the extent permitted and needed, our credit facility and (ii) investing and financing cash requirements (including an estimated $3.3 million of capital expenditures and transaction fees that may be required over the next two years in connection with anticipated lease extensions) from the foregoing, as well as property financings, property sales and sale of our common stock. We and our joint venture partner are also re-developing the Manahawkin Property - we estimate that our share of the capital expenditures required in connection with such re-development will range from $12.0 million to $15.0 million. We are evaluating various sources of funding for such expenditures including borrowings from our credit facility.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, information with respect to our mortgage debt that is payable from January 2021 through December 31, 2023 (excluding the mortgage debt of our unconsolidated joint venture):\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 42,144\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal due at maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,835\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 30,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,979\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, an unconsolidated joint venture had a first mortgage on its property (i.e., the Manahawkin Property) with an outstanding balance of approximately $22.9 million, bearing interest at 4.0% per annum and maturing in July 2025.\nWe intend to make debt amortization payments from operating cash flow and, though no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard, generally intend to refinance, extend or payoff the mortgage loans which mature in 2021 through 2023. We intend to repay the amounts not refinanced or extended from our existing funds and sources of funds, including our available cash, proceeds from the sale of our common stock and our credit facility (to the extent available).\nWe continually seek to refinance existing mortgage loans on terms we deem acceptable to generate additional liquidity. Additionally, in the normal course of our business, we sell properties when we determine that it is in our best interests, which also generates additional liquidity. Further, since each of our encumbered properties is subject to a non-recourse mortgage (with standard carve-outs), if our in-house evaluation of the market value of such property is less than the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage loan, we may determine to convey, in certain circumstances, such property to the mortgagee in order to terminate our mortgage obligations, including payment of interest, principal and real estate taxes, with respect to such property.\nTypically, we utilize funds from our credit facility to acquire a property and, thereafter secure long-term, fixed rate mortgage debt on such property. We apply the proceeds from the mortgage loan to repay borrowings\nunder the credit facility, thus providing us with the ability to re-borrow under the credit facility for the acquisition of additional properties.\nCredit Facility\nOur credit facility provides that subject to borrowing base requirements, we can borrow up to $100.0 million for the acquisition of commercial real estate, repayment of mortgage debt, and renovation and operating expense purposes; provided, that if used for renovation and operating expense purposes, the amount outstanding for such purposes will not exceed the lesser of $30.0 million and 30% of the borrowing base subject to a cap of (i) $10.0 million for renovation expenses and (ii) $20.0 million for operating expense purposes. On June 30, 2022, the amount we can borrow for renovation expenses and operating expenses changes to $20.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively. To the extent that as of July 1, 2022 more than $10.0 million is outstanding for operating expense purposes, such excess must be repaid immediately. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. The facility matures December 31, 2022 and bears interest equal to the one month LIBOR rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 175 basis points if our ratio of total debt to total value (as calculated pursuant to the facility) is equal to or less than 50%, increasing to a maximum of 300 basis points if such ratio is greater than 65%. The applicable margin was 200 basis points for 2020 and 2019. There is an unused facility fee of 0.25% per annum on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and $100.0 million. The credit facility requires the maintenance of $3.0 million in average deposit balances. For 2020, the weighted average interest rate on the facility was approximately 2.53% and as of February 28, 2021, the rate on the facility was 1.87%.\nThe terms of our credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to, among other things, the minimum amount of tangible net worth, the minimum amount of debt service coverage, the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage, the maximum amount of debt to total value, the minimum level of net income, certain investment limitations and the minimum value of unencumbered properties and the number of such properties. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable-interest and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 32,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 59,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 94,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 232,728\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable-balances due at maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307,700\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,492\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 128,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 136,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 262,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 572,870\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Represents the amount outstanding at December 31, 2020.

See -General Challenges and Uncertainties\u201d and -Challenges and Uncertainties Facing Certain Tenants and Properties - The Vue\u201d, and -Re-development of the Manahawkin Property\u201d. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $433.5 million of mortgage debt outstanding (excluding mortgage debt of our unconsolidated joint venture), all of which is non-recourse (subject to standard carve-outs). We expect that mortgage interest and amortization payments (excluding repayments of principal at maturity) of approximately $92.2 million due through 2023 will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations. We anticipate that principal balances due at maturity through 2023 of $56.8 million will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and refinancings. If we are unsuccessful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties, our cash flow, funds available under our credit facility and available cash, if any, may not be sufficient to repay all debt obligations when payments become due, and we may need to issue additional equity, obtain long or short- term debt, or dispose of properties on unfavorable terms.\nCash Distribution Policy\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, to qualify as a REIT, we must, among other things, meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute currently at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders. It is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal, state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently (in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations) to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify for federal taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income (i.e., taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations thereunder) and are subject to Federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\nIt is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code no less than 90%, and, if possible, 100% of our annual taxable income, including taxable gains from the sale of real estate. It will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code.\nOf the aggregate $36.6 million of dividends declared in 2020, $6.8 million or 18.7% was paid in the form of stock (excluding $1.0 million paid in stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan). We paid dividends in stock to conserve cash in response to the economic dislocations resulting from the pandemic. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the amount and nature (i.e., cash or stock) of dividend payments based on its assessment of, among other things, our short and long-term cash and liquidity requirements, prospects, debt maturities, projections of our REIT taxable income, net income, funds from operations, and adjusted funds from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements other than with respect to a land parcel owned by us and located in Beachwood, Ohio. This parcel is improved by a multi-family complex and we ground leased the parcel to the owner/operator of such complex. The ground lease generated $729,000, $783,000 and $1.4 million of rental income, net, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the land on our balance sheet was $13.9 million; our leasehold position is subordinate to $67.2 million of mortgage debt incurred by our tenant, the owner/operator of the multi-family complex. In addition, as described in - Challenges and Uncertainties Facing Certain Tenants and Properties - The Vue,\u201d we have agreed to fund certain capital expenditures and operating cash flow shortfalls at this property. We do not believe that this type of off-balance sheet arrangement has been or will be material to our liquidity and capital resource positions, except to the extent we determine to continue to fund the capital expenditures required by, and the operating cash flow shortfalls at this property. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this arrangement.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements in this report. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRental Income\nRental income includes: (i) base rents that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of each lease and (ii) reimbursements by tenants of certain real estate operating expenses. Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectable. We review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant's payment history and the financial condition of the tenant. In the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is unlikely, we are required to write-off the receivable, which has an adverse effect on net income for the year in which the direct write-off is taken, and will decrease total assets and stockholders' equity.\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate\nThe fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and other value of in-place leases based in each case on their fair values. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land, building and building improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land, building and building improvements based on our determination of relative fair values of these assets. We assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on our experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The portion of the values of the leases associated with below-market renewal options that we deem likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. The allocation made by us may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\nCarrying Value of Real Estate Portfolio\nWe review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment to the value of any of our real estate assets, including deferred costs and intangibles, to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge. In reviewing the portfolio, we examine the type of asset, the current financial statements or other available financial information of the tenant, the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located, the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease, as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant, including property inspection reports. For each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows attributable to the asset to its carrying amount. Management's assumptions and estimates include projected rental rates during the holding period and property capitalization rates in order to estimate undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value is less than the asset's carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property. Real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis. We generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations. Any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders' equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge, but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property.", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of a REIT focused on acquiring and managing a portfolio of industrial, retail, restaurant, health and fitness, and theater properties. The report highlights challenges and uncertainties faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on tenants and property income. The company granted rent deferrals and abatements, deferred dividend payments, and modified its credit facility to address liquidity and capital resource requirements. Additionally, the report discusses challenges and uncertainties beyond the pandemic, such as lease renewals, tenant credit risk monitoring, and the impact of e-commerce on retail properties. Specific challenges are detailed for certain tenants and properties, including Regal Cinemas, LA Fitness, and The Vue in Ohio. The report also provides an update on tenants that filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and the redevelopment of the Manahawkin Property.", "item_7_tables": "Table 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on acquiring, owning and managing a geographically diversified portfolio of industrial, retail (including furniture stores and supermarkets), restaurant, health and fitness and theater properties, many of which are subject to long-term leases. Most of our leases are net leases\u201d under which the tenant, directly or indirectly, is responsible for paying the real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs of the property. As of December 31, 2020, we own, in 31 states, 123 properties, including four properties owned by consolidated joint ventures and three properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe most significant challenge we faced in 2020, and the significant uncertainties we face in the near term, are the direct and indirect economic and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses thereto. The pandemic had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the global economy, the U.S. economy, and the economies of the local markets in which our properties are located. The preventative measures taken to address the pandemic, and the economic consequences resulting therefrom, have affected, and will continue to affect, our tenants to varying degrees depending on, among other things, the location of the subject property and the nature of the tenant and use of the property (i.e., industrial or non-industrial), with retail (both general and specialized), theater, health and fitness, and restaurant properties having been and continuing to be significantly adversely affected.\nThe pandemic and the current economic, financial, and capital markets environments present material risks and uncertainties. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the pandemic and the continuing economic slowdown will have on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, which will depend largely on future developments relating, among other things, to the duration and scope of the pandemic, efforts to boost the economy, the timing and strength of an economic recovery, if any, and other factors outside of our control. If the pandemic and economic slowdown continue for an extended period, among other things,\n \u25cf tenants, and in particular, tenants in the retail, restaurant, theater and health and fitness sectors, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us (including obligations under deferral arrangements or extended leases) and may seek additional rent relief, may choose not to renew their leases, or if they renew, may do so on terms less favorable to us, \n \u25cf it is more likely that tenants that to date have only been minimally impacted will be significantly and adversely effected, \n \u25cf the amounts tenants at challenged properties pay us may be insufficient, without an accommodation from the mortgage lender at such properties, to pay our debt service obligations with respect to such properties, \n \u25cf the mortgage lenders for challenged properties may be unwilling or unable to allow for accommodations or further accommodations with respect to our debt service obligations at such properties, \n \u25cf the transformation of the retail, restaurant, health and fitness and theater sectors toward the provision by these sectors of goods and services through e-commerce distribution channels at the expense of the bricks and mortar distribution channels, may continue to grow at an accelerating rate, \n \u25cf it may be more difficult to obtain equity and debt financing, and \n \u25cf it may be more difficult to acquire properties to grow our business and dispose of underperforming assets. \nOur business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, ability to service our debt, and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, may be adversely affected upon the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing. The risks, uncertainties and challenges presented by the pandemic and the economic slowdown may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, challenges and uncertainties described in this report.\nDeferrals and Abatements; Addressing Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe summarize below certain information, as of December 31, 2020 (unless otherwise indicated), regarding the impact of the pandemic on our business and our responses thereto. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the accounting treatment afforded to abatements and deferrals of rental payments.\nWe deferred the payment of an aggregate of approximately $3.5 million, or 4.8%, of the annual base rent otherwise payable during 2020. Of such sum, $1.6 million, or 47.0%, is payable by four tenants at 16 properties. Of the total $3.5 million deferral, approximately 14.2% was repaid in 2020 and 79.6%, 5.9% and 0.3% are to be paid in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. These deferrals do not (i) modify or defer tenant obligations to reimburse us for property level operating expenses and (ii) affect our net income, funds from operations or adjusted funds from operations; however, they reduced cash available for acquisitions, operations and dividends. We may grant, as circumstances require, rent deferrals in addition to those described in this report.\nThe abatements we agreed to reduced for 2020 (before giving effect to the impact of lease extensions on straight-line rent as described below) rental income by $1.4 million. For seven tenants, we linked a rent abatement to a lease extension (and for another tenant, reduced the lease term and the base rent payable) at a property. As a result of the abatements coupled with the modified lease term,\n \u25cf the aggregate base rent payable beginning January 1, 2021 by these eight tenants over the modified lease term increased by $16.3 million over the amount payable prior to such abatement/lease modification, and \n \u25cf because of the effect of straight-line rent, the net reduction in rental income during 2020 was $465,000. \nWe may grant, as circumstances require, rent abatements in addition to those described in this report.\nThe table below provides information regarding the base rent due and collected for the periods indicated, before and after giving effect to deferrals and abatements (dollars in thousands):\n _______________\n (1) Before D&A represents the base rents due or collected, as the case may be, for the applicable period, before giving effect to rent deferral and abatement agreements. \n (2) Retail, reflected above, includes our Retail-Furniture, Retail-Supermarket and Retail-Office Supply sectors. \n (3) After D&A represents the base rents due or collected, as the case may be, for the applicable period, after giving effect to rent deferral and abatement agreements. \n (4) Includes $497,000 of deferral repayments (i.e., $142,000 by industrial tenants, $275,000 by retail tenants and $80,000 by restaurant tenants). \n (5) Includes repayments of $338,000 (i.e., $58,000 by industrial tenants, $215,000 by retail tenants and $65,000 by restaurant tenants) related to deferrals taken in prior periods. \n (6) Includes repayments of $529,000 (i.e., $116,000 by industrial tenants, $348,000 by retail tenants and $65,000 by restaurant tenants) related to deferrals taken in prior periods. \nTo conserve cash and enhance our financial flexibility:\n \u25cf we paid a portion of our dividends in stock - specifically, we paid approximately 50%, or $4.5 million, of the $9.1 million dividend declared in June 2020 through the issuance of 263,229 shares of common stock and $2.3 million or 25% of the $9.2 million dividend declared in September 2020 through the issuance of 141,227 shares of common stock; the weighted average price at which such stock was issued was $16.88 per share. \n \u25cf our credit facility was amended to increase from $10.0 million to $20.0 million the amount we can use for working capital and operating expense through June 30, 2022; \n \u25cf we have and continue to manage and monitor our mortgage maturities. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, debt service of $32.4 million, $31.4 million and $28.4 million is payable, respectively. Generally, we and our mortgage lenders have modified our debt service obligations so that such obligations at a particular property do not exceed the amounts we are contractually entitled to receive from the tenant at such property, after giving effect to rent abatements or deferrals. During 2020, mortgage lenders deferred payment of $1.8 million of debt service due in 2020 (including our $218,000 share of the debt service at a joint venture property); approximately 9.9% of such deferred debt was paid in 2020, 12.6% of such debt is deferred from 2021 through 2023, and 77.4% is deferred until the maturity of such debt, and \n \u25cf we have and continue to monitor carefully compliance with the terms and conditions of our credit facility and are in continual contact with our lenders. While we currently believe we will continue to be in compliance with the facility's financial covenants, if, among other things, tenants contributing certain levels of base rent terminate their leases, seek bankruptcy protection or obtain rent concessions, we may not continue to comply with the terms thereof. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility.\u201d \nGeneral Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn addition to the challenges and uncertainties presented by the pandemic, and as also described under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, we, among other things, face additional challenges and uncertainties, which are heightened by the pandemic, including the possibility we will not be able to: acquire or dispose of properties on acceptable terms, lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all, collect amounts owed to us by our tenants, renew or re-let, on acceptable terms, leases that are expiring or otherwise terminating.\nWe seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio and the related financing arrangements by (i) diversifying among types of properties, industries, locations, tenants, scheduled lease expirations, mortgage maturities and lenders, and (ii) minimizing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. As a result, as of December 31, 2020:\n \u25cf our 2021 contractual rental income is derived from the following property types: 55.5% from industrial, 32.4% from retail, 5.0% from restaurant, 4.7% from health and fitness and 2.4% from other properties, \n \u25cf there are seven states with properties that account for five percent or more of 2021 contractual rental income, and no state accounts for more than 9.3% of 2021 contractual rental income, \n \u25cf there are two tenants (i.e., Haverty Furniture and FedEx) that account for more than five percent of 2021 contractual rental income and those tenants account for 12.2% of contractual rental income. \n \u25cf through 2029, there are two years in which the percentage of our 2021 contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds 10% (i.e., 21.0% in 2022 and 12.6% in 2023)-approximately 21.2% of our 2021 contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in 2030 and thereafter, \n \u25cf after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements, substantially all of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates, \n \u25cf in 2021, 2022 and 2023, 5.2%, 10.6% and 7.0% of our total scheduled principal mortgage payments (i.e., amortization and balances due at maturity) is due, respectively, and \n \u25cf there are six different counterparties to our portfolio of interest rate swaps: four counterparties, rated A- or better by a national rating agency, account for 90.7%, or $76.9 million, of the notional value of our swaps; and two counterparties, rated A- by other ratings providers, account for 9.3%, or $7.8 million, of the notional value of such swaps. \nWe monitor the risk of tenant non-payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation. Generally, based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants, we monitor a tenant's financial condition through one or more of the following actions: reviewing tenant financial statements or other financial information, obtaining other tenant related information, regular contact with tenant's representatives, tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants. We may sell a property if the tenant's financial condition is unsatisfactory.\nWe monitor, on an ongoing basis, our expiring leases and generally approach tenants with expiring leases (including those subject to renewal options) at least a year prior to lease expiration to determine their interest in renewing their leases. In 2021 and 2022, 31 tenants with 34 leases for 28 properties representing $15.6 million, or 22.6%, of 2021 contractual rental income expire. The following table provides information, as of December 31, 2020, regarding the leases that expire in 2021 and 2022 (with respect to the multi-tenant shopping centers in Royersford, Pennsylvania and Lakewood, Colorado, which have both retail and restaurant tenants, we have allocated the property count and associated mortgage debt to the retail (and not restaurant) categories because these are mixed-use properties):\n ______________\n (1) In 2020 and 2019, the rental income reflected above of $71.4 million and $73.4 million, respectively, excludes tenant reimbursement income of $10.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively. \n (2) Retail, reflected above, includes our Retail-Furniture, Retail-Supermarket and Retail-Office Supply sectors. \n (3) Haverty Furniture leases eleven of these properties. \nWe are negotiating lease extensions with respect to several properties that account for at least 7.0% of 2021 contractual rental income and at which the lease(s) expire in 2022. We anticipate that if such arrangements are finalized, as to which no assurance can be given, (i) we will extend the leases for several properties for periods ranging from four years to nine years, (ii) a lease for at least one of these properties will not be renewed, and (iii) we will expend an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million from 2021 through 2023 for capital improvements and transaction costs at several of these properties. As a result of the foregoing and other accommodations that may be provided in connection with renewing the leases at these properties, we anticipate that the base rent and cash flow from operations generated by the properties that are re-leased will decrease beginning in late 2022 from that currently generated by all of such properties. If other significant tenants with leases expiring in 2021 and 2022 choose not to renew their leases or negotiate for renewals on terms less favorable to us than currently in effect, we may be adversely affected due to the reduction in base rents received and the expenses associated with maintaining vacant properties.\nIn acquiring properties, we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired, which analysis takes into account, among other things, the estimated value of the property, local demographics and the ability to re-rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination.\nWe are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry as a result of the growth of e-commerce. Over the past several years, we have been addressing our exposure to the retail industry by focusing on acquiring industrial properties (including warehouse and distribution facilities) and properties that we believe capitalize on e-commerce activities - since September 2016, we have not acquired any retail properties and have sold 13 retail properties. As a result of the focus on industrial properties and the sale of retail properties, retail properties generated 32.9%, 35.2%, 41.9% and 43.7%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and industrial properties generated 55.4%, 48.7%, 40.1% and 35.1%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have variable rate debt in the principal amount of $97.7 million (i.e., $84.7 million of mortgage debt and $13.0 million of credit facility debt) that bear interest at the one month LIBOR rate plus a negotiated spread. This mortgage debt is hedged through interest rate swaps and the credit facility debt is not hedged. The authority regulating LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the circulation of LIBOR after June 2023 and it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable at an earlier date. As approximately $68.7 million of this mortgage debt and the related notional amount of the interest rate swaps mature after June 2023, there is uncertainty as to how the interest rate on this variable rate debt and the related swaps will be determined when LIBOR is unavailable.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Facing Certain Tenants and Properties\nSet forth below is a description of the challenges and uncertainties facing certain tenants or properties:\nRegal Cinemas\n \u25cf Regal Cinemas is a tenant at three properties, including a property owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. Regal Cinemas closed substantially all of its theaters in October 2020 and has not indicated when the theaters at our properties will re-open. We summarize below certain information about our Regal Cinemas properties: \n - the two consolidated properties accounted for $165,000 and $2.5 million of rental income, during 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, we, among other things, (i) wrote-off, as reduction to rental income, $1.1 million of the tenant's unbilled rent receivable, (ii) did not collect and did not accrue $928,000 of the rent due principally for September through December 2020, and (iii) abated rent of $676,000. At December 31, 2020, our Indianapolis, Indiana property had mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities and intangible lease assets of approximately $4.0 million, $654,000 and $832,000, respectively. There is no mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities or intangible lease assets at our Greensboro, North Carolina property at which we lease the underlying fee and in turn lease the property to Regal Cinemas. We estimate that the carrying costs for these properties for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021 are approximately $725,000, including real estate taxes of approximately $337,000 and debt service of $184,000. Regal Cinemas is the primary obligor with respect to $541,000 of such costs and we are only responsible with respect to such amount if it is not paid by Regal Cinemas. \n - a Regal Cinemas theater is a tenant at a multi-tenant property located in Manahawkin, New Jersey and which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. Our 50% share of the base rent paid by Regal Cinemas at this property was $69,000, $237,000, and $237,000 representing 5.2%, 16.5% and 13.0% of our share of the total base rent payable by all tenants at such property in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Regal Cinemas has not paid our share (i.e., $89,000) of the base rent due for the four months ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, our share of the mortgage debt at this property was approximately $11.4 million. \n \u25cf In February 2021, we entered into lease amendments with Regal Cinemas pursuant to which: \n - with respect to the Indianapolis, Indiana and Greensboro, North Carolina properties, we agreed to defer an aggregate of $1.4 million of rent otherwise payable from September 2020 through August 2021, the tenant agreed to pay an aggregate of $441,000 of rent during such period and the parties extended the lease for the Indianapolis, Indiana property for two years, and \n - with respect to the Manahawkin, New Jersey property, we agreed to defer our 50% share of an aggregate of $182,000 of rent otherwise payable from September 2020 through August 2021, and the parties extended the lease for one year, and \n \u25cf The deferred amounts are to be repaid in equal installments from January 2022 through June 2023. \nLA Fitness\n \u25cf LA Fitness, an owner/operator of health and fitness facilities, is a tenant at three properties. During 2020, we deferred $290,000 and abated $500,000 of the base rent this tenant was required to pay. In connection with these accommodations, the tenant agreed to extend the lease at one property for five years which, due to the effect of straight-line rent, we estimate will contribute an additional $24,000 annually to rental income. This tenant paid base rent of $2.4 million and $3.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we anticipate that they will pay base rent of $3.4 million in 2021 (including $133,000 of deferral repayments). At December 31, 2020, the mortgage debt, unbilled rent receivable, intangible lease assets and intangible lease liabilities with respect to these properties was $12.5 million, $1.4 million, $523,000 and $36,000, respectively. \nThe Vue - Beachwood, Ohio\n \u25cf A multi-family complex, which we refer to as The Vue, ground leases from us the underlying land located in Beachwood, Ohio. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the owner/operator of the property paid us $729,000, $783,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, of rental income, all of which was variable rent. For the past several years, the property has faced, and we anticipate that for at least the next several months, if not longer, the property will continue to face, occupancy, financial and litigation challenges. For the past several months, the property, after giving effect to mortgage payments, has operated on a negative cash flow basis, and we anticipate that it will continue to operate on a negative cash flow basis for at least the next several months, if not longer. The tenant has not paid the aggregate $486,000 of rent owed from October 2020 through March 2021 and we do not anticipate that the tenant will resume making rental payments for the next several months, if not longer. In November 2020, the ground lease was amended to require, among other things, that the owner/operator deposit $1.2 million to pay certain past due operating expenses and a portion of anticipated future operating cash flow shortfalls at the property as well as $170,000 to pay a portion of the capital expenditures required at the property (all of which sums have been deposited). We agreed, subject to our discretion, to fund 78% of (i) any further operating expense shortfalls at the property after the $1.2 million operating expense deposit has been fully utilized, and (ii) capital expenditures required at the property. (We estimate that the property currently requires capital expenditures of $700,000 to $1.2 million). During the first quarter of 2021 (through March 4, 2021), we provided The Vue with $409,000 to cover, among other things, (i) the anticipated operating cash flow shortfalls for February and March 2021 and (ii) capital expenditures for November 2020 through January 2021. At December 31, 2020, (i) there are no unbilled rent receivables, intangibles or tenant origination costs associated with this property and (ii) the net book value of our land subject to this ground lease is $13.9 million and is subordinate to $67.2 million of mortgage debt incurred by the owner/operator. If the tenant does not resume making monthly rental payments, ceases paying its mortgage obligations, or, if pursuant to the ground lease amendment, we fund additional capital expenditures or operating expense shortfalls at the property, our cash flow will be adversely impacted. See \"- Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. \nUpdate as to Status of Tenants that filed for Bankruptcy in 2020\nIn our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, we reported that four tenants leasing ten properties had filed for bankruptcy protection from May through August 2020. As of February 28, 2021, these tenants or their respective affiliates, NPC International, a Wendy's franchisee that, among other things, operates more than 385 Wendy's restaurants, CEC Entertainment, Inc., the operator of Chuck E Cheese restaurants, Tuesday Morning Corporation, a Nasdaq listed retailer specializing in home products, and Tailored Brands, the parent of Men's Wearhouse, had exited bankruptcy. With respect to these four tenants, we estimate that after giving effect to lease amendments entered into in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, total base rent and rental income will (i) decrease by approximately $177,000 and $292,000, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2021 and (ii) increase by approximately $897,000 and $128,000, respectively, from January 1, 2021 through the expiration (without giving effect to any extension options) of the applicable leases.\nRe-development of the Manahawkin Property\nWe are re-developing the Manahawkin Property, which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% equity interest. As a result of this re-development activity and the related decrease in occupancy, and more recently, the failure of Regal Cinemas, a significant tenant at this property, to pay rent, the income and cash flow from this property decreased significantly over the past several years and the property's carrying costs (including debt service payments) exceed the operating cash flow generated therefrom. Because of, among other things, the (i) decrease in rent, (ii) possibility that co-tenancy", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on acquiring, owning and managing a geographically diversified portfolio of industrial, retail (including furniture stores and supermarkets), restaurant, health and fitness and theater properties, many of which are subject to long-term leases. Most of our leases are net leases\u201d under which the tenant, directly or indirectly, is responsible for paying the real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs of the property. As of December 31, 2020, we own, in 31 states, 123 properties, including four properties owned by consolidated joint ventures and three properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe most significant challenge we faced in 2020, and the significant uncertainties we face in the near term, are the direct and indirect economic and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses thereto. The pandemic had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the global economy, the U.S. economy, and the economies of the local markets in which our properties are located. The preventative measures taken to address the pandemic, and the economic consequences resulting therefrom, have affected, and will continue to affect, our tenants to varying degrees depending on, among other things, the location of the subject property and the nature of the tenant and use of the property (i.e., industrial or non-industrial), with retail (both general and specialized), theater, health and fitness, and restaurant properties having been and continuing to be significantly adversely affected.\nThe pandemic and the current economic, financial, and capital markets environments present material risks and uncertainties. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the pandemic and the continuing economic slowdown will have on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, which will depend largely on future developments relating, among other things, to the duration and scope of the pandemic, efforts to boost the economy, the timing and strength of an economic recovery, if any, and other factors outside of our control. If the pandemic and economic slowdown continue for an extended period, among other things,\n \u25cf tenants, and in particular, tenants in the retail, restaurant, theater and health and fitness sectors, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us (including obligations under deferral arrangements or extended leases) and may seek additional rent relief, may choose not to renew their leases, or if they renew, may do so on terms less favorable to us, \n \u25cf it is more likely that tenants that to date have only been minimally impacted will be significantly and adversely effected, \n \u25cf the amounts tenants at challenged properties pay us may be insufficient, without an accommodation from the mortgage lender at such properties, to pay our debt service obligations with respect to such properties, \n \u25cf the mortgage lenders for challenged properties may be unwilling or unable to allow for accommodations or further accommodations with respect to our debt service obligations at such properties, \n \u25cf the transformation of the retail, restaurant, health and fitness and theater sectors toward the provision by these sectors of goods and services through e-commerce distribution channels at the expense of the bricks and mortar distribution channels, may continue to grow at an accelerating rate, \n \u25cf it may be more difficult to obtain equity and debt financing, and \n \u25cf it may be more difficult to acquire properties to grow our business and dispose of underperforming assets. \nOur business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, ability to service our debt, and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, may be adversely affected upon the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing. The risks, uncertainties and challenges presented by the pandemic and the economic slowdown may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, challenges and uncertainties described in this report.\nDeferrals and Abatements; Addressing Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe summarize below certain information, as of December 31, 2020 (unless otherwise indicated), regarding the impact of the pandemic on our business and our responses thereto. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the accounting treatment afforded to abatements and deferrals of rental payments.\nWe deferred the payment of an aggregate of approximately $3.5 million, or 4.8%, of the annual base rent otherwise payable during 2020. Of such sum, $1.6 million, or 47.0%, is payable by four tenants at 16 properties. Of the total $3.5 million deferral, approximately 14.2% was repaid in 2020 and 79.6%, 5.9% and 0.3% are to be paid in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. These deferrals do not (i) modify or defer tenant obligations to reimburse us for property level operating expenses and (ii) affect our net income, funds from operations or adjusted funds from operations; however, they reduced cash available for acquisitions, operations and dividends. We may grant, as circumstances require, rent deferrals in addition to those described in this report.\nThe abatements we agreed to reduced for 2020 (before giving effect to the impact of lease extensions on straight-line rent as described below) rental income by $1.4 million. For seven tenants, we linked a rent abatement to a lease extension (and for another tenant, reduced the lease term and the base rent payable) at a property. As a result of the abatements coupled with the modified lease term,\n \u25cf the aggregate base rent payable beginning January 1, 2021 by these eight tenants over the modified lease term increased by $16.3 million over the amount payable prior to such abatement/lease modification, and \n \u25cf because of the effect of straight-line rent, the net reduction in rental income during 2020 was $465,000. \nWe may grant, as circumstances require, rent abatements in addition to those described in this report.\nThe table below provides information regarding the base rent due and collected for the periods indicated, before and after giving effect to deferrals and abatements (dollars in thousands):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

average price at which such stock was issued was $16.88 per share. \n \u25cf our credit facility was amended to increase from $10.0 million to $20.0 million the amount we can use for working capital and operating expense through June 30, 2022; \n \u25cf we have and continue to manage and monitor our mortgage maturities. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, debt service of $32.4 million, $31.4 million and $28.4 million is payable, respectively. Generally, we and our mortgage lenders have modified our debt service obligations so that such obligations at a particular property do not exceed the amounts we are contractually entitled to receive from the tenant at such property, after giving effect to rent abatements or deferrals. During 2020, mortgage lenders deferred payment of $1.8 million of debt service due in 2020 (including our $218,000 share of the debt service at a joint venture property); approximately 9.9% of such deferred debt was paid in 2020, 12.6% of such debt is deferred from 2021 through 2023, and 77.4% is deferred until the maturity of such debt, and \n \u25cf we have and continue to monitor carefully compliance with the terms and conditions of our credit facility and are in continual contact with our lenders. While we currently believe we will continue to be in compliance with the facility's financial covenants, if, among other things, tenants contributing certain levels of base rent terminate their leases, seek bankruptcy protection or obtain rent concessions, we may not continue to comply with the terms thereof. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility.\u201d \nGeneral Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn addition to the challenges and uncertainties presented by the pandemic, and as also described under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, we, among other things, face additional challenges and uncertainties, which are heightened by the pandemic, including the possibility we will not be able to: acquire or dispose of properties on acceptable terms, lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all, collect amounts owed to us by our tenants, renew or re-let, on acceptable terms, leases that are expiring or otherwise terminating.\nWe seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio and the related financing arrangements by (i) diversifying among types of properties, industries, locations, tenants, scheduled lease expirations, mortgage maturities and lenders, and (ii) minimizing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. As a result, as of December 31, 2020:\n \u25cf our 2021 contractual rental income is derived from the following property types: 55.5% from industrial, 32.4% from retail, 5.0% from restaurant, 4.7% from health and fitness and 2.4% from other properties, \n \u25cf there are seven states with properties that account for five percent or more of 2021 contractual rental income, and no state accounts for more than 9.3% of 2021 contractual rental income, \n \u25cf there are two tenants (i.e., Haverty Furniture and FedEx) that account for more than five percent of 2021 contractual rental income and those tenants account for 12.2% of contractual rental income. \n \u25cf through 2029, there are two years in which the percentage of our 2021 contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds 10% (i.e., 21.0% in 2022 and 12.6% in 2023)-approximately 21.2% of our 2021 contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in 2030 and thereafter, \n \u25cf after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements, substantially all of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates, \n \u25cf in 2021, 2022 and 2023, 5.2%, 10.6% and 7.0% of our total scheduled principal mortgage payments (i.e., amortization and balances due at maturity) is due, respectively, and \n \u25cf there are six different counterparties to our portfolio of interest rate swaps: four counterparties, rated A- or better by a national rating agency, account for 90.7%, or $76.9 million, of the notional value of our swaps; and two counterparties, rated A- by other ratings providers, account for 9.3%, or $7.8 million, of the notional value of such swaps. \nWe monitor the risk of tenant non-payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation. Generally, based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants, we monitor a tenant's financial condition through one or more of the following actions: reviewing tenant financial statements or other financial information, obtaining other tenant related information, regular contact with tenant's representatives, tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants. We may sell a property if the tenant's financial condition is unsatisfactory.\nWe monitor, on an ongoing basis, our expiring leases and generally approach tenants with expiring leases (including those subject to renewal options) at least a year prior to lease expiration to determine their interest in renewing their leases. In 2021 and 2022, 31 tenants with 34 leases for 28 properties representing $15.6 million, or 22.6%, of 2021 contractual rental income expire. The following table provides information, as of December 31, 2020, regarding the leases that expire in 2021 and 2022 (with respect to the multi-tenant shopping centers in Royersford, Pennsylvania and Lakewood, Colorado, which have both retail and restaurant tenants, we have allocated the property count and associated mortgage debt to the retail (and not restaurant) categories because these are mixed-use properties):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease Term to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 Rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity (months)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 49,384\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail (2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,861\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health & Fitness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Theater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 104,245\n</td> </tr>\n</table> ______________\n (1) In 2020 and 2019, the rental income reflected above of $71.4 million and $73.4 million, respectively, excludes tenant reimbursement income of $10.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively. \n (2) Retail, reflected above, includes our Retail-Furniture, Retail-Supermarket and Retail-Office Supply sectors. \n (3) Haverty Furniture leases eleven of these properties. \nWe are negotiating lease extensions with respect to several properties that account for at least 7.0% of 2021 contractual rental income and at which the lease(s) expire in 2022. We anticipate that if such arrangements are finalized, as to which no assurance can be given, (i) we will extend the leases for several properties for periods ranging from four years to nine years, (ii) a lease for at least one of these properties will not be renewed, and (iii) we will expend an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million from 2021 through 2023 for capital improvements and transaction costs at several of these properties. As a result of the foregoing and other accommodations that may be provided in connection with renewing the leases at these properties, we anticipate that the base rent and cash flow from operations generated by the properties that are re-leased will decrease beginning in late 2022 from that currently generated by all of such properties. If other significant tenants with leases expiring in 2021 and 2022 choose not to renew their leases or negotiate for renewals on terms less favorable to us than currently in effect, we may be adversely affected due to the reduction in base rents received and the expenses associated with maintaining vacant properties.\nIn acquiring properties, we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired, which analysis takes into account, among other things, the estimated value of the property, local demographics and the ability to re-rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination.\nWe are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry as a result of the growth of e-commerce. Over the past several years, we have been addressing our exposure to the retail industry by focusing on acquiring industrial properties (including warehouse and distribution facilities) and properties that we believe capitalize on e-commerce activities - since September 2016, we have not acquired any retail properties and have sold 13 retail properties. As a result of the focus on industrial properties and the sale of retail properties, retail properties generated 32.9%, 35.2%, 41.9% and 43.7%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and industrial properties generated 55.4%, 48.7%, 40.1% and 35.1%, of rental income, net, in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have variable rate debt in the principal amount of $97.7 million (i.e., $84.7 million of mortgage debt and $13.0 million of credit facility debt) that bear interest at the one month LIBOR rate plus a negotiated spread. This mortgage debt is hedged through interest rate swaps and the credit facility debt is not hedged. The authority regulating LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the circulation of LIBOR after June 2023 and it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable at an earlier date. As approximately $68.7 million of this mortgage debt and the related notional amount of the interest rate swaps mature after June 2023, there is uncertainty as to how the interest rate on this variable rate debt and the related swaps will be determined when LIBOR is unavailable.\nChallenges and Uncertainties Facing Certain Tenants and Properties\nSet forth below is a description of the challenges and uncertainties facing certain tenants or properties:\nRegal Cinemas\n \u25cf Regal Cinemas is a tenant at three properties, including a property owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. Regal Cinemas closed substantially all of its theaters in October 2020 and has not indicated when the theaters at our properties will re-open. We summarize below certain information about our Regal Cinemas properties: \n - the two consolidated properties accounted for $165,000 and $2.5 million of rental income, during 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, we, among other things, (i) wrote-off, as reduction to rental income, $1.1 million of the tenant's unbilled rent receivable, (ii) did not collect and did not accrue $928,000 of the rent due principally for September through December 2020, and (iii) abated rent of $676,000. At December 31, 2020, our Indianapolis, Indiana property had mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities and intangible lease assets of approximately $4.0 million, $654,000 and $832,000, respectively. There is no mortgage debt, intangible lease liabilities or intangible lease assets at our Greensboro, North Carolina property at which we lease the underlying fee and in turn lease the property to Regal Cinemas. We estimate that the carrying costs for these properties for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021 are approximately $725,000, including real estate taxes of approximately $337,000 and debt service of $184,000. Regal Cinemas is the primary obligor with respect to $541,000 of such costs and we are only responsible with respect to such amount if it is not paid by Regal Cinemas. \n - a Regal Cinemas theater is a tenant at a multi-tenant property located in Manahawkin, New Jersey and which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. Our 50% share of the base rent paid by Regal Cinemas at this property was $69,000, $237,000, and $237,000 representing 5.2%, 16.5% and 13.0% of our share of the total base rent payable by all tenants at such property in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Regal Cinemas has not paid our share (i.e., $89,000) of the base rent due for the four months ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, our share of the mortgage debt at this property was approximately $11.4 million. \n \u25cf In February 2021, we entered into lease amendments with Regal Cinemas pursuant to which: \n - with respect to the Indianapolis, Indiana and Greensboro, North Carolina properties, we agreed to defer an aggregate of $1.4 million of rent otherwise payable from September 2020 through August 2021, the tenant agreed to pay an aggregate of $441,000 of rent during such period and the parties extended the lease for the Indianapolis, Indiana property for two years, and \n - with respect to the Manahawkin, New Jersey property, we agreed to defer our 50% share of an aggregate of $182,000 of rent otherwise payable from September 2020 through August 2021, and the parties extended the lease for one year, and \n \u25cf The deferred amounts are to be repaid in equal installments from January 2022 through June 2023. \nLA Fitness\n \u25cf LA Fitness, an owner/operator of health and fitness facilities, is a tenant at three properties. During 2020, we deferred $290,000 and abated $500,000 of the base rent this tenant was required to pay. In connection with these accommodations, the tenant agreed to extend the lease at one property for five years which, due to the effect of straight-line rent, we estimate will contribute an additional $24,000 annually to rental income. This tenant paid base rent of $2.4 million and $3.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we anticipate that they will pay base rent of $3.4 million in 2021 (including $133,000 of deferral repayments). At December 31, 2020, the mortgage debt, unbilled rent receivable, intangible lease assets and intangible lease liabilities with respect to these properties was $12.5 million, $1.4 million, $523,000 and $36,000, respectively. \nThe Vue - Beachwood, Ohio\n \u25cf A multi-family complex, which we refer to as The Vue, ground leases from us the underlying land located in Beachwood, Ohio. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the owner/operator of the property paid us $729,000, $783,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, of rental income, all of which was variable rent. For the past several years, the property has faced, and we anticipate that for at least the next several months, if not longer, the property will continue to face, occupancy, financial and litigation challenges. For the past several months, the property, after giving effect to mortgage payments, has operated on a negative cash flow basis, and we anticipate that it will continue to operate on a negative cash flow basis for at least the next several months, if not longer. The tenant has not paid the aggregate $486,000 of rent owed from October 2020 through March 2021 and we do not anticipate that the tenant will resume making rental payments for the next several months, if not longer. In November 2020, the ground lease was amended to require, among other things, that the owner/operator deposit $1.2 million to pay certain past due operating expenses and a portion of anticipated future operating cash flow shortfalls at the property as well as $170,000 to pay a portion of the capital expenditures required at the property (all of which sums have been deposited). We agreed, subject to our discretion, to fund 78% of (i) any further operating expense shortfalls at the property after the $1.2 million operating expense deposit has been fully utilized, and (ii) capital expenditures required at the property. (We estimate that the property currently requires capital expenditures of $700,000 to $1.2 million). During the first quarter of 2021 (through March 4, 2021), we provided The Vue with $409,000 to cover, among other things, (i) the anticipated operating cash flow shortfalls for February and March 2021 and (ii) capital expenditures for November 2020 through January 2021. At December 31, 2020, (i) there are no unbilled rent receivables, intangibles or tenant origination costs associated with this property and (ii) the net book value of our land subject to this ground lease is $13.9 million and is subordinate to $67.2 million of mortgage debt incurred by the owner/operator. If the tenant does not resume making monthly rental payments, ceases paying its mortgage obligations, or, if pursuant to the ground lease amendment, we fund additional capital expenditures or operating expense shortfalls at the property, our cash flow will be adversely impacted. See \"- Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\" and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. \nUpdate as to Status of Tenants that filed for Bankruptcy in 2020\nIn our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, we reported that four tenants leasing ten properties had filed for bankruptcy protection from May through August 2020. As of February 28, 2021, these tenants or their respective affiliates, NPC International, a Wendy's franchisee that, among other things, operates more than 385 Wendy's restaurants, CEC Entertainment, Inc., the operator of Chuck E Cheese restaurants, Tuesday Morning Corporation, a Nasdaq listed retailer specializing in home products, and Tailored Brands, the parent of Men's Wearhouse, had exited bankruptcy. With respect to these four tenants, we estimate that after giving effect to lease amendments entered into in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, total base rent and rental income will (i) decrease by approximately $177,000 and $292,000, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2021 and (ii) increase by approximately $897,000 and $128,000, respectively, from January 1, 2021 through the expiration (without giving effect to any extension options) of the applicable leases.\nRe-development of the Manahawkin Property\nWe are re-developing the Manahawkin Property, which is owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% equity interest. As a result of this re-development activity and the related decrease in occupancy, and more recently, the failure of Regal Cinemas, a significant tenant at this property, to pay rent, the income and cash flow from this property decreased significantly over the past several years and the property's carrying costs (including debt service payments) exceed the operating cash flow generated therefrom. Because of, among other things, the (i) decrease in rent, (ii) possibility that co-tenancy"}
