MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page ii of this annual report. For simplicity, this report uses the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d to refer to TCW Direct Lending VII LLC.\nOverview\nWe were formed on May 23, 2017 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We conducted a private offering of our common limited liability company units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d).\nOn August 18, 2017 (\u201cInception Date\u201d), we sold and issued 10 Units at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000 to TCW Asset Management Company LLC (\u201cTAMCO\u201d), an affiliate of the TCW Group, Inc.\nOn December 29, 2017, we filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.\nOn April 13, 2018 (the \u201cInitial Closing Date\u201d), we began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of our Units and on January 14, 2019, we completed our fourth and final closing sale of our Units. We have sold 13,734,010 Units for an aggregate offering price of approximately $1.4 billion. Each Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and each Unit's Commitment obligation is $100.00 per Unit. The sale of the Units was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and each investor. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, we may draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Unit generally upon at least ten business days' prior written notice to the unitholders. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an \u201cUndrawn Commitment.\u201d\nWe commenced operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nDuring 2018, we formed two Delaware limited liability companies which each have a single member interest owned by us. On February 12, 2020, we formed TCW DLG Funding VII 2020-1 LLC, our third wholly-owned, single member Delaware limited liability company.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. The historical investment philosophy, strategy and approach of the direct lending team of the Adviser (the \u201cDirect Lending Team\u201d) has generally not involved the use of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, or similar arrangements. Although we do not currently expect the Direct Lending Team to originate a significant amount of investments for us with PIK interest features, from time to time we may make, and currently have, investments that contain such features. We may have investments with PIK interest features in certain circumstances involving debt restructurings or work-outs of current investments. Our highly negotiated private investments may include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, notes and other non-convertible debt securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias will be towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments.\nWe are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We may also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments will mostly be in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners indirectly in a company through a joint venture partnership or other special purpose vehicle. While we intend to invest primarily in U.S. companies, there may be certain instances where we will invest in companies domiciled elsewhere.\nExpenses\nWe do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Amended and Restated Administration Agreement, dated as of September 25, 2018 (the \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d) and the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of December 29, 2017, (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d).\nWe, and indirectly our Unitholders, will bear all costs, expenses and liabilities, other than Adviser Operating Expenses (which shall be borne by the Adviser), in connection with our organization, operations, administration and transactions (\u201cCompany Expenses\u201d). Company Expenses shall include, without limitation: (a) organizational expenses and expenses associated with the issuance of the Units; (b) expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); (c) fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; (d) expenses incurred by the Adviser or the Administrator payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to or associated with monitoring our financial and legal affairs, providing administrative services, monitoring or administering our investments and performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and the corresponding portfolio companies; (e) costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable federal or state securities laws; (f) fees and expenses incurred in connection with debt incurred to finance our investments or operations, and payment of interest and repayment of principal on such debt; (g) expenses related to sales and purchases of Units and other securities; (h) Management Fees and Incentive Fees; (i) administrator fees, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement; (j) transfer agent, sub-administrator and custodial fees; (k) expenses relating to the issue, repurchase and transfer of Units to the extent not borne by the relevant transferring Unitholders and/or assignees; (l) federal and state registration fees; (m) federal, state and local taxes and other governmental charges assessed against us; (n) independent directors' fees and expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of our board of directors or any committee thereof; (o) fees and expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of the Unitholders or holders of any Preferred Units, as well as the compensation of an investor relations professional responsible for the coordination and administration of the foregoing; (p) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to Unitholders, including printing and mailing costs; (q) costs and expenses related to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and tax returns; (r) our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; (s) direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and copying; (t) independent auditors and outside legal costs, including legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, \u201cno-action\u201d positions or other guidance sought from a regulator, pertaining to us; (u) compensation of other personnel (including employees and secretarial and other staff of the Administrator) to the extent they are devoted to preparing our consolidated financial statements or tax returns or providing similar \u201cback office\u201d financial services to us; (v) Adviser costs and expenses (excluding travel) in connection with identifying and investigating investment opportunities for us, monitoring our investments and disposing of any such investments; (w) portfolio risk management costs; (x) commissions or brokerage fees or similar charges incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities (including merger fees); (y) costs and expenses attributable to normal and extraordinary investment banking, commercial banking, accounting, auditing, appraisal, valuation, administrative agent activities, custodial and registration services provided to us, including in each case services with respect to the proposed purchase or sale of securities by us that are not reimbursed by the issuer of such securities or others (whether or not such purchase or sale is consummated); (z) costs of amending, restating or modifying the LLC Agreement or Advisory Agreement or related documents of us or related entities; (aa) fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the termination, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or related entities; and (bb) all other properly and reasonably chargeable expenses incurred by the Company or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. However, in the event of a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) that results in a Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or an Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), including a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) pursuant to which the Company becomes the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), the fees, costs and expenses associated with any such restructuring, initial public offering, listing of equity securities or reorganization will be borne appropriately by the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) (and indirectly only by Unitholders that elect to become investors in the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement)), as the case may be, and no others will directly or indirectly bear such fees, costs or expenses.\nHowever, we will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of our aggregate Commitments for organizational expenses and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Units through January 14, 2019 and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of our aggregate Commitments computed annually for Company Expenses; provided, that, any amount by which actual annual expenses in (b) exceed the 12.5 basis point limit shall be carried over to the next year, without limitation, as additional expense until the earlier of the Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the dissolution of the Company, with any partial year assessed on a pro rata basis; and provided, further, that in determining the Company Expenses subject to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b), the following expenses shall be excluded and shall be borne by us as incurred without regard to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b): the Management Fee, the Incentive Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap), amounts incurred in connection with our borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses arising out of or related to any borrowing or borrowing facility and similar costs), transfer agent fees, federal, state and local taxes and other governmental charges assessed against us, expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any\nindependent valuation firm engaged for that purpose and the costs and expenses of the valuation of our portfolio investments performed by our independent auditors in order to comply with applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards), costs and expenses incurred in connection with arranging or structuring investments and their ongoing operations (including expenses and liabilities related to the formation and ongoing operations of any special purpose entity or entities in connection with an investment), legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, \u201cno-action\u201d positions or other guidance sought from a regulator pertaining to us, costs and expenses relating to any Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or liquidation of the\nCompany and any extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company carryforward to future periods the amount by which actual annual Company Expenses for a year exceed the 12.5 basis point limit for more than three years from the date on which such expenses were reimbursed.\n\u201cAdviser Operating Expenses\u201d means overhead and operating and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Adviser or any of its affiliates, including us, in connection with maintaining and operating the Adviser's office, including salaries and other compensation (including compensation due to its officers), rent, routine office equipment expense and liability and insurance premiums (other than those incurred in maintaining fidelity bonds and Indemnitee insurance policies), in furtherance of providing supervisory investment management services for us. Adviser Operating Expenses include any expenses incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the Adviser's registration as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or with its compliance as a registered investment adviser thereunder.\nAll Adviser Operating Expenses and all our expenses that we will not bear, as set forth above, will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates.\nIn connection with borrowings, our lenders require us to pledge assets, Commitments and/or the right to draw down on Commitments. In this regard, the subscription agreement entered into with each of our investors contractually obligates each investor to fund its respective Commitments in order to pay amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations.\nWe expensed organization costs totaling $0.7 million (net of $0.4 million in Adviser reimbursement) since our inception through December 31, 2018. Offering costs totaling $0.6 million (net of $0.3 million in Adviser reimbursement) was charged directly to Members' Capital on December 31, 2018. No additional organization and offering costs were incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018. We did not bear more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments for organization and offering expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value and approved by the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs.\nFair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value:\nLevel 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs.\nLevel 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.\nCategorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\nLevel 1 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 1), includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades.\nLevel 2 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 2), includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments.\nLevel 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable.\nDebt, (Level 3), includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value or, in some cases, an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events.\nEquity, (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied.\nPricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.\nInvestment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 60 debt investments and 11 equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 98.7% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 1.3% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock, preferred stock and warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of 50 debt investments and four equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 99.6% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 0.4% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock and warrants.\nWe had no debt investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe table below describes our debt and equity investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets by industry as December 31, 2020:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total Investments </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aerospace & Defense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemicals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy Equipment and Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beverages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information Technology Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Household Durables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Publishing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Media\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals & Mining\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Household Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction Materials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Health Care Technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiline Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto Components\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Electronic Equipment, Instrument & Components\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and Engineering\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Services and Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internet & Direct Marketing Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Air Freight & Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest income including interest income paid-in-kind, was $146.3 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we also earned $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in other fee income.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 87,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 13,132 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized (loss) gain on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,601 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in Members' Capital from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 69,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total investment income\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $146.7 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively, and included $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0, respectively, of other fee income.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the increase in our portfolio of debt investments, which included to 60 debt investments as of December 31, 2020, compared to 50 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations. Our portfolio of investments increased to 54 total debt and equity investments from 21, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. More specifically, our portfolio of debt investments increased to 50 as of December 31, 2019, compared to 20 as of December 31, 2018.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $98.2 million, $35.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to higher total investment income primarily attributable to the larger size of our investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, total expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This net reduction was due to a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of our internal rate of return (\u201cIRR\u201d) falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting in a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, versus $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the increase in the size of our portfolio.\nExpenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and credit facilities expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organization costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 7,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses (reimbursed) recaptured by the Adviser\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,023 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Our total expenses were $49.6 million, $52.4 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our total expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of $19.8 million, $13.3 million and $2.4 million; and incentive fees attributed to the advisor of $3.1million, $12.1 million and $0, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs previously described, the decrease in total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This was a result of a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to our IRR falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in incentive fees was partially offset by an increase in management fees attributed to the Adviser during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, consistent with the overall increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nThe increase in our total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations.\nNet expenses include an expense (reimbursement) recapture of ($1.0) million, $0 and $0.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expense reimbursement during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects Company Expenses (as defined in our Administration Agreement) that we incurred in excess of our annual 12.5 basis point limit (i.e. in accordance with our Administration Agreement, we will not bear Company Expenses more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of aggregate commitments annually).\nThe expense recapture during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to organizational and offering costs which were previously reimbursed by the Adviser.\nNet realized (loss) gain on investments\nOur net realized (loss) gain on investments for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was ($20.7) million, $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nOur net realized loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to our restructuring of our term loans to Production Resource Group, LLC and Centric Brands, Inc., which resulted in a realized loss of $20.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively. These were partially offset by our $1.0 million of realized gain from our revolver to UniTek Acquisition, Inc.\nOur net realized gain during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to our term loans to SMTC Corporation and Heligear Acquisition Co., for which we recognized $0.4 million and $0.3 million in realized gains, respectively, during the year.\nOur net realized gain on investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to our term loans to VPI Aware Topco, LLC and Shipston Group U.S Inc. for which recognized realized gains of $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019

from operations\nOur net increase in members' capital from operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $69.8 million, $43.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively.\nThe relative increase in members' capital from operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due higher net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by higher net realized and unrealized loss on investments during the period.\nThe relative increase in increase in members' capital from operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the increase in net investment income resulting from the significant increase in the size of our portfolio during the year compared to prior year, during which our operations did not commence until the second quarter.\nOur net increase in members' capital during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the commencement and ramp up of operations which began during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn April 13, 2018, we completed the first closing of the sale of our Units to persons not affiliated with the Adviser. We also commenced operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. On January 14, 2019, we completed our fourth and final closing sale of our Units. We generate cash from (1) drawing down capital in respect of Units, (2) cash flows from investments and operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders.\nOur primary use of cash is for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including expenses, the Management Fee, the Incentive Fee, and any indemnification obligations), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the Unitholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate Commitments, Undrawn Commitments, percentage of Commitments funded and the number of subscribed for Units of the Company were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,373,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Undrawn commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of commitments funded\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Units\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,734,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> On May 10, 2018, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cNatixis Credit Agreement\u201d) among the Company, as borrower, and Natixis, New York Branch (\u201cNatixis\u201d), as administrative agent and the committed lenders, conduit lenders and funding agents. The Natixis Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit line (the \u201cNatixis Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $150.0 million (the \u201cNatixis Maximum Commitment\u201d), subject to the lesser of the \u201cNatixis Borrowing Base\u201d assets or the Natixis Maximum Commitment. The Natixis Borrowing Base assets equal the sum of a percentage of unfunded commitments from certain classes of eligible investors in the Company (the \u201cNatixis Available Commitment\u201d). The Natixis Revolving Credit Facility is generally secured by the Natixis Borrowing Base assets.\nThe Natixis Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by us, up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. The maturity date of the Natixis Credit Agreement is May 10, 2021, unless such date is extended at our option, no more than two times for a term of up to 364 days after the maturity date per such extension. Borrowings under the Natixis Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) a base rate calculated in a customary manner plus 0.55% or (b) an adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 1.55%. As of December 31, 2019, the Natixis Maximum Commitment was $400.0 million. The Natixis Maximum Commitment was reduced to $340.0 million on April 21, 2020 and was further reduced to $280.0 million on July 1, 2020.\nThe Natixis Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest, subject to customary exceptions, in (i) all of the capital commitments of the investors in the Company, (ii) our right to make capital calls, receive payment of capital contributions from the investors and enforce payment of the capital commitments and capital contributions under our operating agreement and (iii) a cash collateral account into which the capital contributions from the investors are made.

The PNC Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by the Borrower up to an aggregate principal amount of $900.0 million, subject to lender consent and obtaining commitments for the increase. The Borrower may make borrowings of (i) a revolving loan (the \u201cPNC Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Natixis Revolving Credit Facility, the \u201cRevolving Credit Facilities\u201d) under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ending on January 29, 2022 and (ii) a term loan (the \u201cPNC Term Loan\u201d) under the PNC Credit Facility during the period which commenced on January 29, 2019 and ended on January 29, 2020, unless, in the case of (i) and (ii), there is an earlier termination of the PNC Credit Facility or event of default thereunder. The PNC Credit Facility will mature on January 29, 2024. Loans under the PNC Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to, at the Borrower's option, either (i) three-month LIBOR plus the facility margin of 2.30% per annum or (ii) the Base Rate plus the facility margin of 2.30% per annum.\nOn April 11, 2019, the Borrower amended and restated the PNC Credit Agreement (as amended, the \u201cAmended PNC Credit Agreement\u201d) for the PNC Credit Facility. The Amended PNC Credit Agreement, among other things, (a) increased the total commitments under the PNC Credit Facility from $400.0 million to $600.0 million (the \u201cAmended PNC Maximum Commitment\u201d) and (b) made certain modifications to the calculation of the borrowing base under the prior facility, including the eligibility requirements of collateral obligations pledged under the PNC Credit Facility and loan portfolio concentration limits.\nOn March 17, 2020, the Borrower further amended and restated the Amended PNC Credit Agreement (as further amended the \u201cSecond Amended PNC Credit Agreement\u201d). The Second Amended PNC Credit Agreement, among other things, increased the total commitments under the PNC Credit Facility from $600.0 million to $795.0 million (the \u201cSecond Amended PNC Maximum Commitment\u201d). The Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment may be periodically increased in amounts designated by the Borrower up to an aggregate principal amount of $900.0 million, subject to lender consent and obtaining commitments for the increase. The Borrower may make borrowings of (i) revolving loans under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ending on January 29, 2022 and (ii) term loans under the PNC Credit Facility during the period commencing January 29, 2019 and ended on March 17, 2020, unless, there is an earlier termination of the PNC Credit Facility or event of default thereunder. The PNC Credit Facility will mature on January 29, 2024. Loans under the PNC Credit Facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to, at the Borrower's option, either (i) three-month LIBOR plus the facility margin of 2.30% per annum or (ii) the Base Rate plus the facility margin of 2.30% per annum. On June 19, 2020, the Second Amended PNC Maximum Commitment was increased from $795.0 million to $825.0 million.\nThe Borrower's obligations under the PNC Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of the Borrower, including its portfolio of loans that has been contributed by the Company to the Borrower in exchange for 100% of the membership interests of the Borrower and any payments received in respect of such loans. The Company may contribute or sell to the Borrower additional loans from time to time after the closing date, which shall be pledged in favor of the lenders under the PNC Credit Facility.\nUnder the PNC Credit Facility, the Borrower has made customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The PNC Credit Facility also includes events of default that are customary for similar credit facilities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page ii of this annual report. For simplicity, this report uses the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d to refer to TCW Direct Lending VII LLC.\nOverview\nWe were formed on May 23, 2017 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We conducted a private offering of our common limited liability company units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d).\nOn August 18, 2017 (\u201cInception Date\u201d), we sold and issued 10 Units at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000 to TCW Asset Management Company LLC (\u201cTAMCO\u201d), an affiliate of the TCW Group, Inc.\nOn December 29, 2017, we filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.\nOn April 13, 2018 (the \u201cInitial Closing Date\u201d), we began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of our Units and on January 14, 2019, we completed our fourth and final closing sale of our Units. We have sold 13,734,010 Units for an aggregate offering price of approximately $1.4 billion. Each Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and each Unit's Commitment obligation is $100.00 per Unit. The sale of the Units was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and each investor. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, we may draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Unit generally upon at least ten business days' prior written notice to the unitholders. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an \u201cUndrawn Commitment.\u201d\nWe commenced operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nDuring 2018, we formed two Delaware limited liability companies which each have a single member interest owned by us. On February 12, 2020, we formed TCW DLG Funding VII 2020-1 LLC, our third wholly-owned, single member Delaware limited liability company.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. The historical investment philosophy, strategy and approach of the direct lending team of the Adviser (the \u201cDirect Lending Team\u201d) has generally not involved the use of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, or similar arrangements. Although we do not currently expect the Direct Lending Team to originate a significant amount of investments for us with PIK interest features, from time to time we may make, and currently have, investments that contain such features. We may have investments with PIK interest features in certain circumstances involving debt restructurings or work-outs of current investments. Our highly negotiated private investments may include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, notes and other non-convertible debt securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias will be towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments.\nWe are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We may also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments will mostly be in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners indirectly in a company through a joint venture partnership or other special purpose vehicle. While we intend to invest primarily in U.S. companies, there may be certain instances where we will invest in companies domiciled elsewhere.\nExpenses\nWe do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Amended and Restated Administration Agreement, dated as of September 25, 2018 (the \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d) and the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of December 29, 2017, (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d).\nWe, and indirectly our Unitholders, will bear all costs, expenses and liabilities, other than Adviser Operating Expenses (which shall be borne by the Adviser), in connection with our organization, operations, administration and transactions (\u201cCompany Expenses\u201d). Company Expenses shall include, without limitation: (a) organizational expenses and expenses associated with the issuance of the Units; (b) expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); (c) fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; (d) expenses incurred by the Adviser or the Administrator payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to or associated with monitoring our financial and legal affairs, providing administrative services, monitoring or administering our investments and performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and the corresponding portfolio companies; (e) costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable federal or state securities laws; (f) fees and expenses incurred in connection with debt incurred to finance our investments or operations, and payment of interest and repayment of principal on such debt; (g) expenses related to sales and purchases of Units and other securities; (h) Management Fees and Incentive Fees; (i) administrator fees, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement; (j) transfer agent, sub-administrator and custodial fees; (k) expenses relating to the issue, repurchase and transfer of Units to the extent not borne by the relevant transferring Unitholders and/or assignees; (l) federal and state registration fees; (m) federal, state and local taxes and other governmental charges assessed against us; (n) independent directors' fees and expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of our board of directors or any committee thereof; (o) fees and expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of the Unitholders or holders of any Preferred Units, as well as the compensation of an investor relations professional responsible for the coordination and administration of the foregoing; (p) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to Unitholders, including printing and mailing costs; (q) costs and expenses related to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and tax returns; (r) our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; (s) direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and copying; (t) independent auditors and outside legal costs, including legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, \u201cno-action\u201d positions or other guidance sought from a regulator, pertaining to us; (u) compensation of other personnel (including employees and secretarial and other staff of the Administrator) to the extent they are devoted to preparing our consolidated financial statements or tax returns or providing similar \u201cback office\u201d financial services to us; (v) Adviser costs and expenses (excluding travel) in connection with identifying and investigating investment opportunities for us, monitoring our investments and disposing of any such investments; (w) portfolio risk management costs; (x) commissions or brokerage fees or similar charges incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities (including merger fees); (y) costs and expenses attributable to normal and extraordinary investment banking, commercial banking, accounting, auditing, appraisal, valuation, administrative agent activities, custodial and registration services provided to us, including in each case services with respect to the proposed purchase or sale of securities by us that are not reimbursed by the issuer of such securities or others (whether or not such purchase or sale is consummated); (z) costs of amending, restating or modifying the LLC Agreement or Advisory Agreement or related documents of us or related entities; (aa) fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the termination, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or related entities; and (bb) all other properly and reasonably chargeable expenses incurred by the Company or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. However, in the event of a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) that results in a Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or an Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), including a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) pursuant to which the Company becomes the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), the fees, costs and expenses associated with any such restructuring, initial public offering, listing of equity securities or reorganization will be borne appropriately by the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) (and indirectly only by Unitholders that elect to become investors in the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement)), as the case may be, and no others will directly or indirectly bear such fees, costs or expenses.\nHowever, we will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of our aggregate Commitments for organizational expenses and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Units through January 14, 2019 and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of our aggregate Commitments computed annually for Company Expenses; provided, that, any amount by which actual annual expenses in (b) exceed the 12.5 basis point limit shall be carried over to the next year, without limitation, as additional expense until the earlier of the Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the dissolution of the Company, with any partial year assessed on a pro rata basis; and provided, further, that in determining the Company Expenses subject to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b), the following expenses shall be excluded and shall be borne by us as incurred without regard to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b): the Management Fee, the Incentive Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap), amounts incurred in connection with our borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses arising out of or related to any borrowing or borrowing facility and similar costs), transfer agent fees, federal, state and local taxes and other governmental charges assessed against us, expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any\nindependent valuation firm engaged for that purpose and the costs and expenses of the valuation of our portfolio investments performed by our independent auditors in order to comply with applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards), costs and expenses incurred in connection with arranging or structuring investments and their ongoing operations (including expenses and liabilities related to the formation and ongoing operations of any special purpose entity or entities in connection with an investment), legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, \u201cno-action\u201d positions or other guidance sought from a regulator pertaining to us, costs and expenses relating to any Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or liquidation of the\nCompany and any extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company carryforward to future periods the amount by which actual annual Company Expenses for a year exceed the 12.5 basis point limit for more than three years from the date on which such expenses were reimbursed.\n\u201cAdviser Operating Expenses\u201d means overhead and operating and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Adviser or any of its affiliates, including us, in connection with maintaining and operating the Adviser's office, including salaries and other compensation (including compensation due to its officers), rent, routine office equipment expense and liability and insurance premiums (other than those incurred in maintaining fidelity bonds and Indemnitee insurance policies), in furtherance of providing supervisory investment management services for us. Adviser Operating Expenses include any expenses incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the Adviser's registration as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or with its compliance as a registered investment adviser thereunder.\nAll Adviser Operating Expenses and all our expenses that we will not bear, as set forth above, will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates.\nIn connection with borrowings, our lenders require us to pledge assets, Commitments and/or the right to draw down on Commitments. In this regard, the subscription agreement entered into with each of our investors contractually obligates each investor to fund its respective Commitments in order to pay amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations.\nWe expensed organization costs totaling $0.7 million (net of $0.4 million in Adviser reimbursement) since our inception through December 31, 2018. Offering costs totaling $0.6 million (net of $0.3 million in Adviser reimbursement) was charged directly to Members' Capital on December 31, 2018. No additional organization and offering costs were incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018. We did not bear more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments for organization and offering expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value and approved by the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs.\nFair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value:\nLevel 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs.\nLevel 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.\nCategorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\nLevel 1 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 1), includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades.\nLevel 2 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 2), includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments.\nLevel 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable.\nDebt, (Level 3), includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value or, in some cases, an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events.\nEquity, (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied.\nPricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.\nInvestment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 60 debt investments and 11 equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 98.7% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 1.3% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock, preferred stock and warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of 50 debt investments and four equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 99.6% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 0.4% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock and warrants.\nWe had no debt investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe table below describes our debt and equity investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets by industry as December 31, 2020:\n Interest income including interest income paid-in-kind, was $146.3 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we also earned $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in other fee income.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n Total investment income\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $146.7 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively, and included $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0, respectively, of other fee income.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the increase in our portfolio of debt investments, which included to 60 debt investments as of December 31, 2020, compared to 50 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations. Our portfolio of investments increased to 54 total debt and equity investments from 21, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. More specifically, our portfolio of debt investments increased to 50 as of December 31, 2019, compared to 20 as of December 31, 2018.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $98.2 million, $35.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to higher total investment income primarily attributable to the larger size of our investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, total expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This net reduction was due to a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of our internal rate of return (\u201cIRR\u201d) falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting in a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, versus $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the increase in the size of our portfolio.\nExpenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n Our total expenses were $49.6 million, $52.4 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our total expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of $19.8 million, $13.3 million and $2.4 million; and incentive fees attributed to the advisor of $3.1million, $12.1 million and $0, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs previously described, the decrease in total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This was a result of a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to our IRR falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in incentive fees was partially offset by an increase in management fees attributed to the Adviser during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, consistent with the overall increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nThe increase in our total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations.\nNet expenses include an expense (reimbursement) recapture of ($1.0) million, $0 and $0.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expense reimbursement during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects Company Expenses (as defined in our Administration Agreement) that we incurred in excess of our annual 12.5 basis point limit (i.e. in accordance with our Administration Agreement, we will not bear Company Expenses more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of aggregate commitments annually).\nThe expense recapture during the year ended December 31,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

However, in the event of a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) that results in a Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or an Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), including a Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) pursuant to which the Company becomes the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement), the fees, costs and expenses associated with any such restructuring, initial public offering, listing of equity securities or reorganization will be borne appropriately by the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) (and indirectly only by Unitholders that elect to become investors in the Public Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the Extension Fund (as defined in the LLC Agreement)), as the case may be, and no others will directly or indirectly bear such fees, costs or expenses.\nHowever, we will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of our aggregate Commitments for organizational expenses and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Units through January 14, 2019 and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of our aggregate Commitments computed annually for Company Expenses; provided, that, any amount by which actual annual expenses in (b) exceed the 12.5 basis point limit shall be carried over to the next year, without limitation, as additional expense until the earlier of the Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or the dissolution of the Company, with any partial year assessed on a pro rata basis; and provided, further, that in determining the Company Expenses subject to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b), the following expenses shall be excluded and shall be borne by us as incurred without regard to the 12.5 basis point limit in (b): the Management Fee, the Incentive Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap), amounts incurred in connection with our borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses arising out of or related to any borrowing or borrowing facility and similar costs), transfer agent fees, federal, state and local taxes and other governmental charges assessed against us, expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any\nindependent valuation firm engaged for that purpose and the costs and expenses of the valuation of our portfolio investments performed by our independent auditors in order to comply with applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards), costs and expenses incurred in connection with arranging or structuring investments and their ongoing operations (including expenses and liabilities related to the formation and ongoing operations of any special purpose entity or entities in connection with an investment), legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, \u201cno-action\u201d positions or other guidance sought from a regulator pertaining to us, costs and expenses relating to any Reorganization (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or liquidation of the\nCompany and any extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company carryforward to future periods the amount by which actual annual Company Expenses for a year exceed the 12.5 basis point limit for more than three years from the date on which such expenses were reimbursed.\n\u201cAdviser Operating Expenses\u201d means overhead and operating and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Adviser or any of its affiliates, including us, in connection with maintaining and operating the Adviser's office, including salaries and other compensation (including compensation due to its officers), rent, routine office equipment expense and liability and insurance premiums (other than those incurred in maintaining fidelity bonds and Indemnitee insurance policies), in furtherance of providing supervisory investment management services for us. Adviser Operating Expenses include any expenses incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the Adviser's registration as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or with its compliance as a registered investment adviser thereunder.\nAll Adviser Operating Expenses and all our expenses that we will not bear, as set forth above, will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates.\nIn connection with borrowings, our lenders require us to pledge assets, Commitments and/or the right to draw down on Commitments. In this regard, the subscription agreement entered into with each of our investors contractually obligates each investor to fund its respective Commitments in order to pay amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations.\nWe expensed organization costs totaling $0.7 million (net of $0.4 million in Adviser reimbursement) since our inception through December 31, 2018. Offering costs totaling $0.6 million (net of $0.3 million in Adviser reimbursement) was charged directly to Members' Capital on December 31, 2018. No additional organization and offering costs were incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018. We did not bear more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments for organization and offering expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value and approved by the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs.\nFair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value:\nLevel 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs.\nLevel 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.\nCategorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\nLevel 1 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 1), includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades.\nLevel 2 Assets (Investments): The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:\nEquity, (Level 2), includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments.\nLevel 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable.\nDebt, (Level 3), includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value or, in some cases, an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events.\nEquity, (Level 3), includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied.\nPricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.\nInvestment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 60 debt investments and 11 equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 98.7% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 1.3% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock, preferred stock and warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of 50 debt investments and four equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio was 99.6% invested in debt investments which were mostly senior secured, term loans. The remaining 0.4% represented our equity investments, which were comprised of common stock and warrants.\nWe had no debt investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe table below describes our debt and equity investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets by industry as December 31, 2020:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total Investments </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aerospace & Defense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemicals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy Equipment and Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beverages\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information Technology Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Household Durables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Publishing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Media\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals & Mining\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Household Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction Materials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Health Care Technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Products\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiline Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto Components\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Electronic Equipment, Instrument & Components\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and Engineering\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Services and Supplies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internet & Direct Marketing Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Air Freight & Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest income including interest income paid-in-kind, was $146.3 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we also earned $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in other fee income.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 87,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 13,132 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized (loss) gain on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,601 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in Members' Capital from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 69,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Total investment income\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $146.7 million, $87.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively, and included $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0, respectively, of other fee income.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the increase in our portfolio of debt investments, which included to 60 debt investments as of December 31, 2020, compared to 50 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in total investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations. Our portfolio of investments increased to 54 total debt and equity investments from 21, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. More specifically, our portfolio of debt investments increased to 50 as of December 31, 2019, compared to 20 as of December 31, 2018.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $98.2 million, $35.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to higher total investment income primarily attributable to the larger size of our investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, total expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This net reduction was due to a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of our internal rate of return (\u201cIRR\u201d) falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting in a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, versus $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to our net investment income during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the increase in the size of our portfolio.\nExpenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and credit facilities expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Organization costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 7,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses (reimbursed) recaptured by the Adviser\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,023 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Our total expenses were $49.6 million, $52.4 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our total expenses included management fees attributed to the Adviser of $19.8 million, $13.3 million and $2.4 million; and incentive fees attributed to the advisor of $3.1million, $12.1 million and $0, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs previously described, the decrease in total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to a net $9.0 million reduction in incentive fees. This was a result of a $12.1 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to our IRR falling below the hurdle rate stipulated in our Advisory Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, our IRR exceeded the hurdle rate and accordingly, we recorded accrued incentive fees in the amount of $15.3 million, resulting a net incentive fee expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.1 million of incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in incentive fees was partially offset by an increase in management fees attributed to the Adviser during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, consistent with the overall increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nThe increase in our total expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our ramp up of operations since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which is when we commenced operations.\nNet expenses include an expense (reimbursement) recapture of ($1.0) million, $0 and $0.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expense reimbursement during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects Company Expenses (as defined in our Administration Agreement) that we incurred in excess of our annual 12.5 basis point limit (i.e. in accordance with our Administration Agreement, we will not bear Company Expenses more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of aggregate commitments annually).\nThe expense recapture during the year ended December 31,"}
