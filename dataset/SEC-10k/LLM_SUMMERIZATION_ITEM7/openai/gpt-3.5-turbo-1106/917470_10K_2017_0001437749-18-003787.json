MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments' results.\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; transportation and energy costs; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, and inventory held in the supply chain; customers' ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers' or our customers' personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.\nLike other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have entered into nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. The carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments' assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments' products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology.\nWe follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach\u201d to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.\nDue to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments' average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.\nDue to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.\nCarbon flat products\nThe primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCombined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 20 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe tubular and pipe products segment consists of the Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors' expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\nResults of Operations\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Over the past 24 months, metals prices fluctuated significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Metals market prices in December 2017 were approximately 7% and 77% higher than metals market prices in December of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average quarterly metals market prices during 2017 have remained relatively flat after increasing in the first quarter of 2017 and were higher than the average quarterly metals market prices in the comparable quarters of 2016.\nTransactional or spot\u201d selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and therefore cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease. Our year-over-year net sales and earnings comparisons were positively impacted by the price increases, improved customer demand, and increased sales volume of products that we sell in 2017.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, we announced the permanent closure of our carbon flat products segment's Siler City, North Carolina operation. The facility ceased operations in the third quarter of 2017. The land and building associated with the operation is classified as Assets held for sale on the accompanying December 31, 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The operating loss related to the Siler City, North Carolina operation was $1.4 million in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,330,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,055,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,055,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,613 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,078 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(c) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(d) </td> <td> 2017 includes a $6.2 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $275.6 million, or 26.1%, to $1.33 billion in 2017 from $1.06 billion in 2016. Carbon flat products net sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, and were 65.4% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 63.6% in 2016. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, and were 17.1% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, and were 17.6% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.4% of total net sales in 2016. The increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an 11.3% increase in sales volume and a 13.3% increase in average selling prices. Average selling prices increased in all segments during 2017 compared to 2016 as market pricing for metals was higher year-over-year. During the year, we increased our market share for a majority of the product categories that we sell.\nCost of materials sold increased $235.2 million, or 28.7%, to $1.06 billion in 2017 from $820.0 million in 2016. During 2017, we recorded LIFO expense of $2.7 million compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2017 is due to the increased sales volume and increased metals costs of 15.6% during 2017.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 20.7% in 2017 from 22.3% in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the carbon flat products segment to 20.2% from 21.2% in 2016, in the specialty metals flat products segment to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 28.5% from 32.6% in 2016. LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales in 2017 and the LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2017 was due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices in all segments and the increase of carbon flat products sales as a percentage of total net sales.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $22.2 million, or 9.7%, to $251.5 million in 2017 from $229.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.9% in 2017 from 21.7% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased primarily related to the 11.3% volume increase. Distribution expense, in addition to the volume increase, increased as a result of the continued inflationary pressures for freight. Warehouse and processing costs increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, and distribution expense increased by $5.3 million, or 14.5%. Selling and administrative and general costs increased $9.8 million, or 11.4%, primarily related to increased variable based incentive compensation based on increased sales volumes and profitability. Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million, or 5.7%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2017. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $11.7 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $1.9 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $6.3 million, and Corporate expenses increased $2.3 million.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $7.5 million in 2017 compared to $5.3 million in 2016. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.0% in 2017 compared to 2.4% in 2016 due to the increases in LIBOR rates since 2016. Total average borrowings increased $48 million, or 31.5%, from $152.5 million in 2016 to $200.6 million in 2017, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2017.\nIncome before income taxes totaled $16.4 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016.\nAn income tax benefit of (16.0%) was recorded for 2017, compared to an income tax provision of 356.6% in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time $6.2 million benefit from a revaluation of our deferred tax liability to the new corporate income tax rate. The net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the income tax effect for certain aspects of the Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate also included an out-of-period adjustment to correct and record previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, and the associated tax benefit, related to our supplemental executive retirement plan recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustment, which has accumulated since the inception of the plan in 2005, resulted in an increase to after-tax income of $1.9 million. The effective tax rate was disproportionately high in 2016 due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses.\nNet income for 2017 totaled $19.0 million, or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, for 2016.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,147,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,026,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>869,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,371 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTons sold increased 121 thousand tons, or 11.8%, to 1.15 million tons in 2017 from 1.03 million tons in 2016. Toll tons sold increased 14 thousand tons, or 18.8% to 88 thousand tons in 2017 from 74 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve and improved industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2017 compared to 2016. The improved customer demand enabled us to grow our market share in most of the carbon flat products categories we sell.\nNet sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, to $869.6 million in 2017 from $671.0 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased 15.9% to $758 per ton, compared to $653 per ton in 2016. The increase in sales was due to the 15.9% increase in average selling prices and the 11.8% increase in sales volume. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect carbon flat metals market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCost of materials sold increased $164.7 million, or 31.1%, to $693.7 million in 2017 from $529.0 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 17.3% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 11.8% increase in sales volume.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 20.2% in 2017 from 21.2% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $15 per ton to $153 in 2017 from $138 in 2016.\nOperating expenses in 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 8.0%, to $158.0 million from $146.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.2% for 2017 from 21.8% in 2016. The percentage increase in operating expenses in 2017 were less than the volume increases during the year. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable performance based incentive compensation.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $17.9 million compared to operating loss of $4.4 million in 2016.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTons sold increased 8 thousand tons, or 9.6%, to 90 thousand tons in 2017 from 82 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve. Industry-wide shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016. The specialty metals flat products segment increased its market share in stainless products in 2017.\nNet sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, to $227.2 million in 2017 from $189.9 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased to $2,520 per ton, compared to $2,308 per ton in 2016. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect stainless steel and aluminum market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the fourth quarter 2017 prices.\nCost of materials sold increased $34.0 million, or 21.2%, to $194.2 million in 2017 from $160.2 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 10.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 9.6% volume increase.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $366 in 2017 compared to $361 per ton in 2016. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of relatively flat gross margins per ton realized on higher average selling prices in 2017.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $1.9 million, or 9.3%, to $21.8 million in 2017 from $19.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 9.6% of net sales in 2017 from 10.5% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable based incentive compensation related to the increased sales volume and gross profit.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $11.2 million compared to $9.8 million in 2016.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands).\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(c) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, to $233.9 million in 2017 from $194.2 million in 2015. The increase in net sales was due to a 12.6% increase in average selling prices and a 6.9% increase in sales volume during 2017. The increase in volume was due to increased customer demand despite lower industry-wide shipments of pipe and tube products. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect tubular and pipe products market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the fourth quarter 2017 prices\nCost of materials sold increased $36.5 million, or 27.8%, to $167.3 million in 2017 from $130.8 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 12.6% increase in sales volume and a 19.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO expense of $2.7 million in 2017 compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 28.5% in 2017 compared to 32.6%, in 2016. The LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 1.2% of net sales in 2017 compared to the LIFO income which increased gross profit by 0.8% of net sales in 2016. In addition, tubular and pipe products segment gross profit decreased as a result of a change in sales mix to more pipe and fitting products, which traditionally has a lower gross profit, from higher gross profit fabrication product sales.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $6.3 million, or 11.6%, to $62.0 million from $55.7 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 26.5% in 2017 compared to 28.7% in 2016. Operating expenses increased in 2017 primarily as a result of increased distribution expense related to increased shipments and distribution cost inflation, less labor and overhead capitalized into inventory, and increased variable incentive compensation related to increased gross profit and costs associated with a settlement of a commercial dispute.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $4.6 million, compared to an operating income of $7.7 million in 2016.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $2.3 million, or 30.6%, to $9.7 million in 2017 compared to $7.4 million in 2016. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to increased variable performance based incentive compensation and, effective August 2016, when our President of Specialty Metals was appointed to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, his associated costs were classified as Corporate expenses.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nDuring 2015, the hot-rolled carbon coil index pricing declined by approximately 36% as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported material arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals and a global oversupply of metals. The pricing environment in 2015 drove our average selling prices down and caused margins to be pressured as the average cost of inventory did not decrease as quickly as the average selling price, as we traditionally keep approximately two and a half to three months of inventory on hand.\nDuring the first six months of 2016, the market price of metals increased and fully recovered the decrease experienced during 2015. Metals market pricing peaked in June 2016, and then decreased until November 2016. Metals prices in December 2016 were not as high as the June 2016 prices, but were more than 65% per ton higher than the December 2015 prices. Although prices increased during 2016, the average selling price during 2016 was still lower than the average selling price during 2015. Transactional or spot\u201d selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and therefore cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. As sales volumes were relatively flat between the years, lower average selling prices were the driver for our decreased net sales in 2016. When the average selling price decreases, and net sales decreases, the gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally increase.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,055,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,175,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>942,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,779 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,594 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,817 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,078 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,777 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Includes $1,489 and $3,347 of LIFO income for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

Carbon flat products net sales decreased $94.4 million, or 12.3%, and were 63.6% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 65.1% in 2015. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $2.6 million, or 1.3%, and were 18.0% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 16.4% in 2015. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $23.4 million, or 10.8%, and were 18.4% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 18.5% of total net sales in 2015. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to a 10.2% decrease in average selling prices as sales volumes were flat between years. Average selling prices decreased in all segments during 2016 compared to 2015 as market pricing for metals was still lower year-over-year. During 2016, we increased our market share for all of the product categories that we sell.\nCost of materials sold decreased $122.2 million, or 13.0%, to $820.0 million in 2016 from $942.2 million in 2015. During 2016, we recorded LIFO income of $1.5 million compared to LIFO income of $3.3 million recorded in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2016 is due to the decreased metals costs of 12.9% during 2016 as sales volumes were flat between years.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 22.3% in 2016 from 19.8% in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 21.2% in 2016 from 19.2% in 2015 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.6% in 2016 from 32.5% in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 15.7% in 2016 from 8.2% in 2015. LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% and 0.3% of net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2016 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in all segments.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $6.8 million, or 2.9%, to $229.3 million in 2016 from $236.2 million in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.7% in 2016 from 20.1% in 2015. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $5.9 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to reductions in labor hours worked. Administrative costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 3.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and lower variable based incentive compensation. Distribution expense increased by $0.4 million, or 1.2%, on flat sales volumes. Selling expenses increased $1.9 million, or 9.0%, as a result of hiring additional sales professionals. Occupancy expenses decreased $0.8 million as a result of elimination of certain leased warehouse space. Depreciation expense decreased $0.6 million, or 3.0%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2016. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $7.6 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $3.0 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $2.5 million, and Corporate expenses increased $0.3 million.\nThe goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 included a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $0.5 million goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $5.3 million in 2016 compared to $5.7 million in 2015. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.4% in 2016 compared to 2.1% in 2015. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2016 was attributable to lower average borrowings during 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome before income taxes totaled $0.4 million in 2016 compared to a loss before income taxes of $33.6 million in 2015. 2015 loss before income taxes includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge.\nAn income tax provision of 356.6% was recorded for 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of (20.3%) in 2015. The effective tax rate was disproportionately high in 2016 from comparative periods due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses. The 2015 effective income tax rate was impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%.\nNet loss for 2016 totaled $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, for 2015. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,026,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,037,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>765,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>618,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,371 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,217 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTons sold decreased 1.0% to 1.03 million tons in 2016 from 1.04 million tons in 2015. Toll tons sold decreased 27.8% to 74 thousand tons in 2016 from 102 thousand tons in 2015. The decrease in tons sold is due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2016 compared to 2015. Despite the further softening of industry-wide shipments in 2016, we grew our market share in all of the carbon flat product categories we sell.\nNet sales decreased $94.4 million, or 12.3%, to $671.0 million in 2016 from $765.4 million in 2015. Average selling prices in 2016 decreased 11.4% to $653 per ton, compared to $738 per ton in 2015. The decrease in sales was primarily due to a 11.4% decrease in average selling prices during 2016 as volumes were down only 1%. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of lower prices in the metals industry during 2016, discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above.\nCost of materials sold decreased $89.7 million, or 14.5%, to $529.0 million in 2016 from $618.7 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 13.6% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2016 compared to 2015, as volumes were down only 1% between years.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 21.2% in 2016 from 19.2% in 2015. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2016 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $138 in 2016 from $141 in 2015, due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2016.\nOperating expenses in 2016 decreased $7.6 million, or 4.9%, to $146.3 million from $153.9 million in 2015, exceeding the sales volume decrease of 1.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.8% for 2016 from 20.1% in 2015. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, lower depreciation expense and lower occupancy expense as a result of elimination of certain leased warehouse space offset by an increase in distribution expense and increased selling expenses as a result of hiring additional sales professionals.\nOperating loss for 2016 totaled $4.4 million compared to operating loss of $7.2 million in 2015.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,574 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.

The specialty metals flat products segment increased its market share in both the stainless steel and aluminum products it sells.\nNet sales decreased $2.6 million, or 1.3%, to $189.9 million in 2016 from $192.5 million in 2015. Average selling prices in 2016 decreased to $2,308 per ton, compared to $2,671 per ton in 2015. The decrease in sales was due to a 13.6% decrease in the average selling price during 2016, offset by a 14.2% increase in sales volume. The decrease in the year-over-year average selling price per ton is a result of lower market prices of stainless steel and aluminum in 2016. Average market prices for nickel (a component of stainless steel) were also lower in 2016 compared to 2015.\nCost of materials sold decreased $16.5 million, or 9.3%, to $160.2 million in 2016 from $176.7 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 20.6% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2016 compared to 2015, offset by a 14.2% sales volume increase.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 15.7% in 2016 from 8.2% in 2015. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $361 in 2016 compared to $220 per ton in 2015. The increase in the gross profit percentage is a result of our cost of materials sold decreasing more than the average selling price in 2016, compared to 2015 as inventory turnover improved in 2016.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $3.0 million, or 17.7%, to $19.9 million in 2016 from $16.9 million in 2015. The increase in operating expenses is related to the increased sales volume of 14.2%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 10.5% of net sales in 2016 from 8.8% in 2015. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution, wages and variable based incentive compensation increased as a result of higher sales volumes and improved profitability. In 2015, we recorded a $0.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the continued market pressures which fully eliminated the goodwill for the specialty metals flat products segment.\nOperating income for 2016 totaled $9.8 million compared to operating loss of $1.6 million in 2015.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands).\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,868 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> Includes $1,489 and $3,347 of LIFO income in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(b) </td> <td> Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(c) </td> <td> Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(d) </td> <td> The 2015 non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased $23.4 million, or 10.8%, to $194.2 million in 2016 from $217.6 million in 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to a 0.8% decrease in sales volume and a 10.0% decrease in average selling prices during 2016. The decrease in volume was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments of tube and pipe products. The decrease in average selling prices were due to lower industry market prices for metals in 2016 compared to 2015.\nCost of materials sold decreased $16.0 million, or 10.9%, to $130.8 million in 2016 from $146.9 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 0.8% decrease in sales volume and a 10.2% decrease in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016, compared to LIFO income of $3.3 million in 2015.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) remained relatively flat at 32.6% in 2016 compared to 32.5%, in 2015. The LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.8% of net sales in 2016, compared to 1.5% of net sales in 2015.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $2.5 million, or 4.4%, to $55.7 million from $58.2 million in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 28.7% in 2016 compared to 26.8% in 2015. Variable operating expenses, such as variable performance-based incentive compensation, decreased in 2016 as a result of lower sales and income before impairment charges.\nIn 2015, we recorded a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and an $8.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge. There were no intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2016.\nOperating income for 2016 totaled $7.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $11.9 million in 2015. The operating loss for 2015 was the result of the goodwill impairment of $16.5 million and the asset impairment charge of $8.0 million.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $0.3 million, or 4.4%, to $7.4 million in 2016 compared to $7.1 million in 2015. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to our President of Specialty Metals being appointed to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and the associated transfer of expenses from the Specialty Metals flat products segment to the Corporate expenses in 2016.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows\nOur principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations, leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements.\nWe believe that funds available under our credit facility, lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and share repurchases and any business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2017, we used $19.0 million of cash for operations, of which $26.7 million was generated from operating activities and $45.7 million was used for working capital. During 2016, we used $9.8 million of cash for operations, of which $16.8 million was generated from operating activities and $26.6 million was used for working capital.\nNet cash generated from operations totaled $26.7 million during 2017 and was primarily comprised of net income of $18.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $18.6 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $11.9 million, which includes the $6.2 million tax benefit related to the Tax Act. Net cash generated from operations totaled $16.8 million during 2016 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.4 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $1.7 million and the net loss of $1.1 million.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2017 totaled $310.0 million, a $50.0 million increase from December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from higher sales in 2017) and a $20.8 million increase in inventory (resulting from increased inventory levels throughout 2017), offset by a $4.6 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2017) and a $1.6 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities was $9.2 million during 2017, compared to $6.4 million during 2016. In 2017, capital expenditures totaled $10.2 million and were primarily attributable to processing equipment, facilities expansions and facilities maintenance. During 2018, we expect our capital spending to approximate $25 million primarily related to a building expansion and new processing equipment at our existing facilities.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2017, $28.9 million of cash was generated from financing activities which primarily consisted of $31.6 million of net borrowings under our Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, offset by $0.9 million of credit facility fees and expenses paid in connection with the Loan Agreement. In 2016, $17.0 million of cash was generated from financing activities which primarily consisted of $18.8 million of net borrowings under our asset- based credit facility, or ABL Credit Facility.\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018. Our Board previously approved 2017 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid on each of March 15, 2017, June 15, 2017, September 15, 2017 and December 15, 2017. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, limitations on cash dividends under our Loan Agreement (as defined below) and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares are held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the Loan Agreement. Under the Loan Agreement, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $5.0 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $5.0 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 20.0% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($80.0 million at December 31, 2017) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15.0% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($60.0 million at December 31, 2017) and we must maintain a pro-forma ratio of Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under Loan Agreement, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. During 2018, we expect to be limited to the $5.0 million available without restrictions to repurchase common stock and pay dividends.\nThere were no shares repurchased during 2017 or 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 65,283 shares for a total cost of $0.7 million.\nDebt Arrangements\nOn December 8, 2017, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement provides for, among other things: (i) a revolving credit facility of up to $370 million, including a $20 million sub-limit for letters of credit and (ii) a first in, last out revolving credit facility of up to $30 million. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request additional commitments under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. The Loan Agreement matures on December 8, 2022.\nThe Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of our existing and future personal property. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness\u037e (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt\u037e (iii) make investments\u037e (iv) sell assets\u037e (v) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries to the Company\u037e (vi) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness\u037e (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets\u037e and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant which includes: (i) if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($40.0 million at December 31, 2017) or 10.0% of the aggregate borrowing base ($32.9 million at December 31, 2017) then we must maintain a ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period.\nWe have the option to borrow under its revolver based on the agent's base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our covenants and had approximately $128.9 million of availability under the Loan Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $1.9 million of bank financing fees were included in Prepaid expenses and other\u201d and Other long-term assets\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the Loan Agreement and are included in Interest and other expense on debt\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nAs part of the CTI acquisition in July 2011, we assumed approximately $5.9 million of Industrial Revenue Bond, or IRB, indebtedness ($0.9 million at December 31, 2017). The bond matures in April 2018, with the option to provide principal payments annually in April. On April 3, 2017, we made an optional principal payment of $0.9 million. The remaining balance of the IRB is included in Current portion of long-term debt\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as the payment is due in April 2018. Interest is payable monthly, with a variable rate that resets weekly. As a security for payment of the bonds, we obtained a direct pay letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The letter of credit reduces annually by the principal reduction amount. The interest rate at December 31, 2017 was 1.71% for the IRB debt.\nCTI entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the above IRB. At December 31, 2017, the effect of the swap agreement on the bond was to fix the rate at 3.46%. The swap agreement matures in April 2018, and is reduced annually by the amount of the optional principal payments on the bond. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nWe entered into a forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge that commenced June 2013, in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on $53.2 million of the then outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The hedge, which matured on June 1, 2016, fixed the rate at 1.21% plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2016, we used $9.8 million of cash for operations, of which $16.8 million was generated from operating activities and $26.6 million was used for working capital. During 2015, we generated $107.5 million of cash from operations, of which $12.4 million was generated from operating activities and $95.1 million was generated from working capital.\nNet cash used for operations totaled $16.8 million during 2016 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.4 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $1.7 million and the net loss of $1.1 million. Net cash from operations totaled $12.4 million during 2015 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.9 million and the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of $25.0 million, offset by the net loss of $26.8 million.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2016 totaled $260.0 million, a $28.2 million increase from December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $47.9 million increase in inventory (resulting from increased inventory purchases at the end of 2016), a $9.0 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from higher sales volume at the end of 2016) offset by a $23.8 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2016) and a $4.9 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities was $6.4 million during 2016, compared to $7.3 million during 2015. In 2016, capital expenditures were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment and facilities maintenance.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2016, $17.0 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $18.8 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2015, $100.8 million of cash was used for financing activities, which primarily consisted of $98.3 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility.\nOur Board previously approved 2016 and 2015 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2016 and 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>(a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations\n</td> <td>(b) </td> <td> </td> <td>31,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax positions\n</td> <td>(c) </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>(d) </td> <td> </td> <td>11,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,835 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>(e) </td> <td> </td> <td>26,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,453 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> (a) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (b) Future interest obligations are calculated using the debt balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (c) See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years. We expect transportation expenses to increase in excess of general inflation in 2018 due to the Electronic Log Device mandate by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued in 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid investments, with a three month or less maturity, which are readily convertible into cash.\nFair Market Value\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. To measure fair value, we apply a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the credit facility revolver, are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts in maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of its cost or net realizable value with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-11 on January 1, 2017. Inventory costs include the costs of the purchased metals, inbound freight, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.\nCosts of our carbon and specialty metals flat products segments' inventories, including flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method.\nCertain of our tubular and pipe products inventory is stated under the LIFO method. At December 31, 2017, approximately $48.1 million, or 17.5% of consolidated inventory, was reported under the LIFO method of accounting. The cost of the remainder of tubular and pipe product segment's inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first-in, first-out method.\nOn the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Cost of materials sold (exclusive of items shown separately below)\u201d consists of the cost of purchased metals, inbound and internal transfer freight, external processing costs, and LIFO income or expense.\nProperty and Equipment, and Depreciation\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 30 years. We capitalize the costs of obtaining or developing internal-use software, including directly related payroll costs. We amortize those costs over five years, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use.\nIntangible Assets and Recoverability of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the tubular and pipe products segment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for the reporting unit that carries intangible assets.\nIf a quantitative fair value measurement is used, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology. Management's assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results, projected financial information and recent economic events. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. We record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value. We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in normal income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of administrative and general expense.\nDuring 2017, a net tax benefit was recorded based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with SAB No. 118 issued by the SEC, the income tax effect for certain aspects of the Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The guidance provides for a measurement period, up to one year from the enactment date, in which provisional amounts may be adjusted when additional information is obtained, prepared or analyzed about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date, which, if known, would have affected the amounts that were initially recorded as provisional amounts. Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period should be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustment is determined.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred, which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers. Given the proximity of our customers to our facilities, substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nCertain engineered products produced by CTI can take several months to manufacture due to their size and complexity. Substantially all projects are completed within six months. We may request advance payments from customers during the production of these products. These payments are included in Other accrued liabilities\u201d on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue for the contracts is recognized when the product is shipped and title of the product transfers to the customers. Revenues for these engineered products accounted for approximately 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.8% of our net sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nShipping and Handling Fees and Costs\nAmounts charged to customers for shipping and other transportation services are included in net sales. The distribution expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income is entirely comprised of all shipping and other transportation costs incurred by us in shipping goods to its customers.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record compensation expense for stock awards issued to employees and directors. For additional information, see Note 10, Equity Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB issued ASU No 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. This ASU aligns an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. To meet that objective, the ASU expand and refine hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. This ASU also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness. This ASU is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2016-310, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\u201d, which has been deleted. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is permitted in any interim period after issuance of the ASU. All transition requirements and elections should be applied to hedging relationships existing (that is, hedging relationships in which the hedging instrument has not expired, been sold, terminated, or exercised or the entity has not removed the designation of the hedging relationship) on the date of adoption. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)\u201d. This ASU provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The ASU provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. This Update is the final version of proposed Accounting Standards Update 2016-360, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)-Scope of Modification Accounting,\u201d which has been deleted. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for (1) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-15, Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments\u201d. This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. This ASU is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce complexity in the presentation of employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which specifies the accounting for leases. The objective is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. This ASU introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, Inventory (Topic 330)\u201d, which requires that inventory within the scope of this ASU be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. This update is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods. Earlier application was permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU 2014-09 was to become effective for us beginning January 2017; however, ASU 2015-14 deferred our effective date until January 2018, which is when we adopted this standard. The ASU permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). The ASU also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required for customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. We have completed the process of evaluating the effect of the adoption and determined there were no material changes required to our reported revenues as a result of the adoption. The majority of our revenue arrangements generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer goods or services. Based on our evaluation process and review of our contracts with customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on ASU 2015-14 is consistent with our revenue recognition policy under previous guidance.\n.", "summary": "The report is a management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a metals service center with three reportable segments: carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment's focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments' results.\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; transportation and energy costs; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, and inventory held in the supply chain; customers' ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers' or our customers' personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.\nLike other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have entered into nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers' risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. The carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments' assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments' products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology.\nWe follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach\u201d to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.\nDue to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments' average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.\nDue to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.\nCarbon flat products\nThe primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCombined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 20 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe tubular and pipe products segment consists of the Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors' expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\nResults of Operations\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Over the past 24 months, metals prices fluctuated significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Metals market prices in December 2017 were approximately 7% and 77% higher than metals market prices in December of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average quarterly metals market prices during 2017 have remained relatively flat after increasing in the first quarter of 2017 and were higher than the average quarterly metals market prices in the comparable quarters of 2016.\nTransactional or spot\u201d selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and therefore cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease. Our year-over-year net sales and earnings comparisons were positively impacted by the price increases, improved customer demand, and increased sales volume of products that we sell in 2017.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, we announced the permanent closure of our carbon flat products segment's Siler City, North Carolina operation. The facility ceased operations in the third quarter of 2017. The land and building associated with the operation is classified as Assets held for sale on the accompanying December 31, 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The operating loss related to the Siler City, North Carolina operation was $1.4 million in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands):\n\n (a) Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income for 2017 and 2016, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) 2017 includes a $6.2 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nNet sales increased $275.6 million, or 26.1%, to $1.33 billion in 2017 from $1.06 billion in 2016. Carbon flat products net sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, and were 65.4% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 63.6% in 2016. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, and were 17.1% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, and were 17.6% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.4% of total net sales in 2016. The increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an 11.3% increase in sales volume and a 13.3% increase in average selling prices. Average selling prices increased in all segments during 2017 compared to 2016 as market pricing for metals was higher year-over-year. During the year, we increased our market share for a majority of the product categories that we sell.\nCost of materials sold increased $235.2 million, or 28.7%, to $1.06 billion in 2017 from $820.0 million in 2016. During 2017, we recorded LIFO expense of $2.7 million compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2017 is due to the increased sales volume and increased metals costs of 15.6% during 2017.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 20.7% in 2017 from 22.3% in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the carbon flat products segment to 20.2% from 21.2% in 2016, in the specialty metals flat products segment to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 28.5% from 32.6% in 2016. LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales in 2017 and the LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2017 was due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices in all segments and the increase of carbon flat products sales as a percentage of total net sales.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $22.2 million, or 9.7%, to $251.5 million in 2017 from $229.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.9% in 2017 from 21.7% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased primarily related to the 11.3% volume increase. Distribution expense, in addition to the volume increase, increased as a result of the continued inflationary pressures for freight. Warehouse and processing costs increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, and distribution expense increased by $5.3 million, or 14.5%. Selling and administrative and general costs increased $9.8 million, or 11.4%, primarily related to increased variable based incentive compensation based on increased sales volumes and profitability. Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million, or 5.7%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2017. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $11.7 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $1.9 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $6.3 million, and Corporate expenses increased $2.3 million.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $7.5 million in 2017 compared to $5.3 million in 2016. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.0% in 2017 compared to 2.4% in 2016 due to the increases in LIBOR rates since 2016. Total average borrowings increased $48 million, or 31.5%, from $152.5 million in 2016 to $200.6 million in 2017, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2017.\nIncome before income taxes totaled $16.4 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016.\nAn income tax benefit of (16.0%) was recorded for 2017, compared to an income tax provision of 356.6% in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time $6.2 million benefit from a revaluation of our deferred tax liability to the new corporate income tax rate. The net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the income tax effect for certain aspects of the Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate also included an out-of-period adjustment to correct and record previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, and the associated tax benefit, related to our supplemental executive retirement plan recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustment, which has accumulated since the inception of the plan in 2005, resulted in an increase to after-tax income of $1.9 million. The effective tax rate was disproportionately high in 2016 due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses.\nNet income for 2017 totaled $19.0 million, or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, for 2016.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\n\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. \nTons sold increased 121 thousand tons, or 11.8%, to 1.15 million tons in 2017 from 1.03 million tons in 2016. Toll tons sold increased 14 thousand tons, or 18.8% to 88 thousand tons in 2017 from 74 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve and improved industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2017 compared to 2016. The improved customer demand enabled us to grow our market share in most of the carbon flat products categories we sell.\nNet sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, to $869.6 million in 2017 from $671.0 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased 15.9% to $758 per ton, compared to $653 per ton in 2016. The increase in sales was due to the 15.9% increase in average selling prices and the 11.8% increase in sales volume. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect carbon flat metals market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCost of materials sold increased $164.7 million, or 31.1%, to $693.7 million in 2017 from $529.0 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 17.3% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 11.8% increase in sales volume.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 20.2% in 2017 from 21.2% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $15 per ton to $153 in 2017 from $138 in 2016.\nOperating expenses in 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 8.0%, to $158.0 million from $146.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.2% for 2017 from 21.8% in 2016. The percentage increase in operating expenses in 2017 were less than the volume increases during the year. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable performance based incentive compensation.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $17.9 million compared to operating loss of $4.4 million in 2016.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\n\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. \nTons sold increased 8 thousand tons, or 9.6%, to 90 thousand tons in 2017 from 82 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve. Industry-wide shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016. The specialty metals flat products segment increased its market share in stainless products in 2017.\nNet sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, to $227.2 million in 2017 from $189.9 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased to $2,520 per ton, compared to $2,308 per ton in 2016. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect stainless steel and aluminum market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the fourth quarter 2017 prices.\nCost of materials sold increased $34.0 million, or 21.2%, to $194.2 million in 2017 from $160.2 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 10.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 9.6% volume increase.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $366 in 2017 compared to $361 per ton in 2016. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of relatively flat gross margins per ton realized on higher average selling prices in 2017.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $1.9 million, or 9.3%, to $21.8 million in 2017 from $19.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 9.6% of net sales in 2017 from 10.5% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable based incentive compensation related to the increased sales volume and gross profit.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $11.2 million compared to $9.8 million in 2016.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands).\n $ % of net sales ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology.\nWe follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach\u201d to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.\nDue to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments' average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.\nDue to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.\nCarbon flat products\nThe primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCombined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 20 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe tubular and pipe products segment consists of the Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.\nCorporate expenses\nCorporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors' expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.\nResults of Operations\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Over the past 24 months, metals prices fluctuated significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Metals market prices in December 2017 were approximately 7% and 77% higher than metals market prices in December of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average quarterly metals market prices during 2017 have remained relatively flat after increasing in the first quarter of 2017 and were higher than the average quarterly metals market prices in the comparable quarters of 2016.\nTransactional or spot\u201d selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and therefore cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease. Our year-over-year net sales and earnings comparisons were positively impacted by the price increases, improved customer demand, and increased sales volume of products that we sell in 2017.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, we announced the permanent closure of our carbon flat products segment's Siler City, North Carolina operation. The facility ceased operations in the third quarter of 2017. The land and building associated with the operation is classified as Assets held for sale on the accompanying December 31, 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The operating loss related to the Siler City, North Carolina operation was $1.4 million in 2017.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,330,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,055,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,055,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense on debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,613 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,078 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income for 2017 and 2016, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) 2017 includes a $6.2 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nNet sales increased $275.6 million, or 26.1%, to $1.33 billion in 2017 from $1.06 billion in 2016. Carbon flat products net sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, and were 65.4% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 63.6% in 2016. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, and were 17.1% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, and were 17.6% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.4% of total net sales in 2016. The increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an 11.3% increase in sales volume and a 13.3% increase in average selling prices. Average selling prices increased in all segments during 2017 compared to 2016 as market pricing for metals was higher year-over-year. During the year, we increased our market share for a majority of the product categories that we sell.\nCost of materials sold increased $235.2 million, or 28.7%, to $1.06 billion in 2017 from $820.0 million in 2016. During 2017, we recorded LIFO expense of $2.7 million compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2017 is due to the increased sales volume and increased metals costs of 15.6% during 2017.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 20.7% in 2017 from 22.3% in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the carbon flat products segment to 20.2% from 21.2% in 2016, in the specialty metals flat products segment to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 28.5% from 32.6% in 2016. LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales in 2017 and the LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2017 was due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices in all segments and the increase of carbon flat products sales as a percentage of total net sales.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $22.2 million, or 9.7%, to $251.5 million in 2017 from $229.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.9% in 2017 from 21.7% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased primarily related to the 11.3% volume increase. Distribution expense, in addition to the volume increase, increased as a result of the continued inflationary pressures for freight. Warehouse and processing costs increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, and distribution expense increased by $5.3 million, or 14.5%. Selling and administrative and general costs increased $9.8 million, or 11.4%, primarily related to increased variable based incentive compensation based on increased sales volumes and profitability. Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million, or 5.7%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2017. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $11.7 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $1.9 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $6.3 million, and Corporate expenses increased $2.3 million.\nInterest and other expense on debt totaled $7.5 million in 2017 compared to $5.3 million in 2016. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.0% in 2017 compared to 2.4% in 2016 due to the increases in LIBOR rates since 2016. Total average borrowings increased $48 million, or 31.5%, from $152.5 million in 2016 to $200.6 million in 2017, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2017.\nIncome before income taxes totaled $16.4 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016.\nAn income tax benefit of (16.0%) was recorded for 2017, compared to an income tax provision of 356.6% in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time $6.2 million benefit from a revaluation of our deferred tax liability to the new corporate income tax rate. The net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the income tax effect for certain aspects of the Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate also included an out-of-period adjustment to correct and record previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, and the associated tax benefit, related to our supplemental executive retirement plan recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustment, which has accumulated since the inception of the plan in 2005, resulted in an increase to after-tax income of $1.9 million. The effective tax rate was disproportionately high in 2016 due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses.\nNet income for 2017 totaled $19.0 million, or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, for 2016.\nSegment Results of Operations\nCarbon flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,147,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,026,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>869,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,371 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.

Toll tons sold increased 14 thousand tons, or 18.8% to 88 thousand tons in 2017 from 74 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve and improved industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2017 compared to 2016. The improved customer demand enabled us to grow our market share in most of the carbon flat products categories we sell.\nNet sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, to $869.6 million in 2017 from $671.0 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased 15.9% to $758 per ton, compared to $653 per ton in 2016. The increase in sales was due to the 15.9% increase in average selling prices and the 11.8% increase in sales volume. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect carbon flat metals market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCost of materials sold increased $164.7 million, or 31.1%, to $693.7 million in 2017 from $529.0 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 17.3% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 11.8% increase in sales volume.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 20.2% in 2017 from 21.2% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $15 per ton to $153 in 2017 from $138 in 2016.\nOperating expenses in 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 8.0%, to $158.0 million from $146.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.2% for 2017 from 21.8% in 2016. The percentage increase in operating expenses in 2017 were less than the volume increases during the year. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable performance based incentive compensation.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $17.9 million compared to operating loss of $4.4 million in 2016.\nSpecialty metals flat products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of net\nsales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toll tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tons sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average selling price per ton\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of materials sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.

The increase in tons sold is due to improved customer demand in the markets we serve. Industry-wide shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016. The specialty metals flat products segment increased its market share in stainless products in 2017.\nNet sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, to $227.2 million in 2017 from $189.9 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased to $2,520 per ton, compared to $2,308 per ton in 2016. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect stainless steel and aluminum market prices in the first quarter of 2018 to increase over the fourth quarter 2017 prices.\nCost of materials sold increased $34.0 million, or 21.2%, to $194.2 million in 2017 from $160.2 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 10.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 9.6% volume increase.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $366 in 2017 compared to $361 per ton in 2016. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of relatively flat gross margins per ton realized on higher average selling prices in 2017.\nOperating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $1.9 million, or 9.3%, to $21.8 million in 2017 from $19.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 9.6% of net sales in 2017 from 10.5% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable based incentive compensation related to the increased sales volume and gross profit.\nOperating income for 2017 totaled $11.2 million compared to $9.8 million in 2016.\nTubular and pipe products\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands).\n $ % of net sales "}
