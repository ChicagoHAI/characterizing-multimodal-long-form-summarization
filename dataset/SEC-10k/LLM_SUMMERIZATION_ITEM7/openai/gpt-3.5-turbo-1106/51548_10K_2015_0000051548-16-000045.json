MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. We derive revenues primarily from (i) admissions to motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities held at our facilities, (ii) revenue generated in conjunction with or as a result of motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities conducted at our facilities, and (iii) catering, concession and merchandising services during or as a result of these events and amusement activities.\nAdmissions, net\u201d revenue includes ticket sales for all of our racing events and other motorsports activities and amusements, net of any applicable taxes.\nMotorsports and other event related\u201d revenue primarily includes television and ancillary media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping revenues, track rental fees and fees paid by third party promoters for management of non-motorsports events.\nFood, beverage and merchandise\u201d revenue includes revenues from concession stands, direct sales of souvenirs, hospitality catering, programs and other merchandise and fees paid by third party vendors for the right to occupy space to sell souvenirs and concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities.\nDirect expenses include (i) NASCAR event management fees, (ii) motorsports and other event related expenses, which include labor, advertising, costs of competition paid to sanctioning bodies other than NASCAR and other expenses associated with the promotion of all of our motorsports and other events and activities, and (iii) food, beverage and merchandise expenses, consisting primarily of labor and costs of goods sold.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made, actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. We continually review our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation. We consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses. Our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party, if any, has the power and benefits. Therefore, we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we, or another party, have the power to direct these activities.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest, board representation and policy making decisions. We periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. We eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results.\nRevenue Recognition. Advance ticket sales and event-related revenues for future events are deferred until earned, which is generally once the events are conducted. The recognition of event-related expenses is matched with the recognition of event-related revenues.\nNASCAR contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series schedules. Event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event. Under the terms of this arrangement, NASCAR retains 10.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event as a component of its sanction fees. The promoter records 90.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records 25.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors. Ultimately, the promoter retains 65.0 percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event.\nOur revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts, with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time. Some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and/or events and include multiple specified elements, such as tickets, hospitality chalets, suites, display space and signage for each included event. The allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements, events and facilities is based on relative selling price. The sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted.\nRevenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers, internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale.\nBusiness Combinations. All business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Whether net assets or common stock is acquired, fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract-based intangible asset associated with long-term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies, such as NASCAR and IMSA series. The continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year. While individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year, a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore, in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations,\u201d are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill.\nCapitalization and Depreciation Policies. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize costs of the project, including, but not limited to, certain pre-acquisition costs, permitting costs, fees paid to architects and contractors, certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary, property taxes and interest.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also is a matter of judgment. Our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets, industry, legal and regulatory factors, and our expectations of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nInterest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project. We capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin, and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period.\nImpairments / Losses on Retirements of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which could be subject to impairments / losses on retirements. During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 we recorded before-tax charges as losses on retirements of long-lived assets primarily attributable to costs to remove certain other long-lived assets located at our motorsports facilities totaling approximately $16.6 million, $10.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively.\nAs of November 30, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment account for approximately $1.7 billion, or 82.3 percent of our total assets. We account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 and for our long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360.\nWe follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies, among other things, non-amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment, either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually. We complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter, based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets (using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance), supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable.\nWhile we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future (as further described in Risk Factors\u201d), our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at, and trends leading up to, the time the estimates and assumptions are made. Different conditions or assumptions, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with our fiscal 2015 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above. We believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were\nappropriate, relevant, and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes. Our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units.\nIn addition, our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities. In these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee, which adds an additional element of risk that could harm our operating results or financial condition. The carrying value of our equity investment was $103.2 million at November 30, 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses not deductible on our tax return. However, some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense, and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities, which could also adversely impact our cash flow.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50.0 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.\nContingent Liabilities. Our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. In the ordinary course of business, we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our Company. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable. Legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nEquity and Other Investments\nHollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway\nKansas Entertainment, a 50/50 joint venture of Penn, a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Kansas Speedway Development Corporation ( KSDC\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC, operates the Hollywood-themed casino and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas Speedway. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operations of the casino.\nWe have accounted for Kansas Entertainment as an equity investment in our financial statements as of November 30, 2015. Our 50.0 percent portion of Kansas Entertainment's net income was approximately $9.4 million, $8.9 million and $14.1 million for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and is included in equity in net income from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations. Included in our fiscal 2013 income from equity investment amount is approximately $1.1 million related to a one-time property tax refund.\nDistributions from Kansas Entertainment, for the year ended November 30, 2015, totaling $32.1 million, consist of $15.2 million received as a distribution from its profits included in net cash provided by operating activities on our statement of cash flows; the remaining $16.8 million received was recognized as a return of capital from investing activities on our statement of cash flows. We received total distributions of approximately $22.0 million in fiscal 2014.\nStaten Island Property\nOn August 5, 2013, we announced that we sold our 676 acre parcel of property located in Staten Island, New York, to Staten Island Marine Development, LLC ( Marine Development\u201d). Marine Development purchased 100 percent of the outstanding equity membership interests of 380 Development LLC ( 380 Development\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC and\nowner of the Staten Island property, for a total sales price of $80.0 million. In addition, we previously received approximately $4.2 million for an option provided to the purchaser that is nonrefundable and does not apply to the $80.0 million sales price.\nWe received $7.5 million, less closing and other administrative costs, of the sales price at closing. The remaining sales price was financed with us holding a secured mortgage interest in 380 Development as well as the underlying property. The mortgage balance bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0 percent. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have received a principal payment of approximately $6.1 million plus interest on the mortgage balance through November 30, 2015, and we will receive the remaining purchase price of $66.4 million, due March 4, 2016. Interest on the remaining mortgage balance is due quarterly, in arrears, and Marine Development is current with all payments through January 2016. Based on the level of Marine Development's initial investment at closing and continuing investment, we have accounted for the transaction using the cost recovery method and have deferred the recognition of profit of approximately $1.9 million, and interest totaling approximately $10.2 million at November 30, 2015, until the carrying amount of the property is recovered, which will not be until the final payment is made.\nThe net proceeds from the sale, combined with the mortgage interest and related total cash tax benefit, will provide us with approximately $118.0 million in incremental cash flow through the term of the mortgage.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain state settlements are the principal cause of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013. The principal causes of the decreased income tax rate for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 are the tax treatment related to the other income recognized as a result of SMI's abandonment of their interest in SMISC, LLC on January 31, 2014, including the related tax benefits associated with various operating loss and other carryforwards of MA and certain tax filing positions of SMISC, LLC totaling approximately $4.0 million along with certain state income tax adjustments. The principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 are reductions in certain state tax rates.\nAs a result of the above items, our effective income tax rate decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately 38.0 percent, 33.0 percent and 37.7 percent for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nAlso of note, while not impacting the combined current and deferred income tax expense and related income tax rate during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014, as compared to the prior fiscal year, the tax benefit realized in fiscal 2013 attributable to the aforementioned sale of our Staten Island property, as well as the effect of the December 2013 expiration of certain tax legislation impacting depreciation deductions contributed substantially to increased current income taxes paid during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 totaling approximately $51.3 million as compared to approximately $18.1 million during fiscal 2013.\nIn December 2014, Congress passed the Tax Increase Prevention Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2014 and continuing through December 2014, of the previously expired tax legislation. The overall impact to the current fiscal year tax depreciation deduction as a result of the expiration of this legislation at December 2014, substantially contributed to the overall reduction of approximately $18.0 million in our long-term deferred income tax liabilities at November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014. In December 2015, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2015 of the previously expired tax legislation. The impact of this retroactive tax legislation will not affect our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate, but will reduce related income tax payments.\nFuture Trends in Operating Results\nInternational Speedway Corporation is the leading owner of major motorsports entertainment facilities and promoter of motorsports-themed entertainment activities in the United States. We compete for discretionary spending and leisure time with many other entertainment alternatives and are subject to factors that generally affect the recreation, leisure and sports industry, including general economic conditions. Our operations are also sensitive to factors that affect corporate budgets. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, employment and wage levels, business conditions, interest and taxation rates, relative commodity prices, and changes in consumer tastes and spending habits.\nThe unprecedented adverse economic conditions that began in 2008, which significantly impacted consumer confidence and disproportionately affected different demographics of our target customers, continue to influence the frequency with which guests attend our major motorsports entertainment events. Ongoing global and regional uncertainty, lack of a broad based middle class economic recovery, and/or further weakening in the domestic economy may continue to adversely impact attendance levels, guest spending levels, and our ability to secure corporate marketing partnerships in the future. Reductions in any of these categories can directly and negatively affect revenues and profitability. Beginning in 2009 we mitigated the decline of certain revenue categories with sustainable cost containment initiatives. Beginning in 2012, we re-instituted regular merit pay increases to more normalized levels. Certain non-controllable costs, such as NASCAR sanction fees, increased this year and recently executed five-year Sanction Agreements covering 2016 to 2020 include annual, contracted growth in fees (see\nfurther detail in Sanctioning Bodies section). While we are sustaining the significant cost reductions previously implemented and continuously seek ways to improve our operating efficiency, we do not expect further significant cost reductions.\nLooking ahead, we expect the continuing slow, but uneven, recovery in the broader U.S. economy to provide an environment for improved attendance-related and corporate partnership revenues. Our industry will further benefit from NASCAR securing its broadcast rights through the 2024 season with the largest broadcast rights deal in the sport's 66-year history. Consistent with major sports properties throughout the world, broadcast rights represent our company's largest revenue segment. Expanding and extending this contracted revenue will provide us unparalleled long-term cash flow visibility. We also believe the strategic initiatives we and the motorsports industry have undertaken to grow the sport will continue to strengthen the long-term health of our Company.\nThe industry and its stakeholders have demonstrated their commitment to growing the sport by aligning with and executing upon growth initiatives supporting NASCAR's industry-wide strategic plan whose objective is to build upon NASCAR's appeal by enhancing the connection with existing fans, as well as attracting and engaging new Gen Y, youth and multicultural consumers in motorsports. Additional areas of focus include building greater product relevance, cultivating driver star power, growing social media activities and enhancing the event experience.\nSeveral recent and successful on-track innovations that resulted from NASCAR initiatives include the introduction of the Gen 6 Car design, new qualifying formats and enhancements to the Chase for the Championship. In January 2014 NASCAR announced a new championship format that puts greater emphasis on winning races all season long, expands the current Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup field to 16 drivers, and implements a new round-by-round advancement format that ultimately rewards a battle-tested, worthy champion. The format makes every race matter even more, diminishes points racing, puts a premium on winning races and concludes with a best-of-the-best, first-to-the-finish line showdown race - all of which is exactly what fans want. The new Chase structure has driven NASCAR Sprint Cup competition to a whole new level with a thrilling, easy to understand format that we believe translates into greater fan interest and revenue opportunities for these events. Our results from the 2015 Chase support this. At this year's Chase finale at Homestead, consumer and corporate participation exceeded 2014 making this the second year in a row this event's results surpassed the prior year. The final two ISC events of the 2015 season in Phoenix and Homestead were both announced as sellouts prior to the event. In addition, for the combined 2015 Chase events ISC hosted, we experienced an overall four percent increase in grandstand attendance over prior year. These are strong indicators that the Chase format along with other strategic initiatives we have implemented are creating favorable momentum that we expect to continue.\nWe support NASCAR's industry strategy on a number of fronts. As referenced above, we are committed to improving our major motorsports facilities to enhance guest experiences and create stronger fan engagement. Specifically, one of the most ambitious and important projects in our history is the redevelopment of the frontstretch of the Daytona International Speedway, the Company's 56-year-old flagship motorsports facility. This new, state of the art motorsports stadium will enhance the event experience for our fans, marketing partners, broadcasters and the motorsports industry (See \"DAYTONA Rising: Reimagining an American Icon\"). We are confident that elevating the experience at the most important and iconic motorsports facility in North America will grow the DAYTONA 500 brand, our 12 other major motorsports facilities' brands and NASCAR's brand. Ultimately this strategic project will positively influence attendance trends, corporate involvement in the sport, and the long-term strength of future broadcast media rights revenues.\nAdmissions\nDriving event sellouts and creating excess demand is key to the optimal performance of our hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events. An important component of our operating strategy continues to be a long-standing focus on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities. By effectively managing both ticket prices and seating capacity, we have historically shown the ability to stimulate ticket renewals and advance ticket sales.\nAdvance ticket sales provide us many benefits such as earlier cash inflow, and reducing the potential negative impact of actual or forecasted inclement weather. When evaluating ticketing initiatives, we first examine our ticket pricing structure for each segmented seating area and/or offering within our major motorsports entertainment facilities to ensure prices are on target with market demand. When determined necessary, we adjust ticket pricing. We believe our ticket pricing philosophy appropriately factors current demand, and provides attractive price points for all income levels and desired fan experiences.\nIt is important that we maintain the integrity of our ticket pricing model by ensuring our customers who purchase tickets during the renewal period get preferential pricing. We do not adjust pricing downward inside of the sales cycle to avoid rewarding last-minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets. Further, we closely monitor and manage the availability of promotional tickets. Encouraging late cycle buying and offering excess promotional tickets could have a detrimental effect on our ticket pricing model and long-term value of our business. We believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long-term growth rather than to capture short-term incremental revenue at the expense of our customers who purchased tickets during the renewal period. We continue to explore and implement innovative ticket pricing\nstrategies to capture incremental admissions revenue including ticket price increases over time as the event nears and adjusting pricing of specific seats within a section or row with desirable attributes and greater demand.\nAdjusting seating capacity is another consumer-focused strategy to promote sellouts, create excess demand and in turn increase capacity utilization at our major motorsports facilities. Over the past few years, we have reduced capacity at our major motorsports facilities. A significant portion of the capacity reduction was a result of our goal to provide improved fan amenities such as wider seating, create social zones with greater fan interaction/engagement for our guests, and remove sections that do not provide adequate sight lines. Based on our experience and the continual evolution of modern sports facilities, ticket demand relies strongly on creating a more personal experience for the fans. Enhancing the live event experience to compete with the at-home television experience is a critical strategy for our future growth. Other benefits derived from capacity management include improved pricing power for our events; enticing more customers to renew or purchase tickets earlier in the sales cycle; increasing customer retention; driving greater attendance to our lead-in events, such as NASCAR's Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events; generating stronger interest from corporate sponsors; and creating a more visually compelling event for the television audience.\nOther key strategic focus areas designed to build fan engagement and augment the live-event experience include providing enhanced at-track audio and visual experiences, additional and improved concession and merchandise points-of-sale, creating more interactive social zones and offering greater wireless connectivity. We continuously monitor market demand, evaluate customer feedback, and explore next generation live-sports entertainment fan amenities, all of which could further impact how we manage capacity and spend capital at our major motorsports facilities.\nCorporate Partnerships\nNASCAR is a powerful brand with a loyal fan base that we believe is aware of, appreciates and supports corporate participation to a greater extent than fans of any other sports property. The combination of brand power and fan loyalty provides an attractive platform for robust corporate partnerships. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies invested in NASCAR remains higher than any other sport. More than one-in-four FORTUNE 500 companies, and one-in-two FORTUNE 100 companies, use NASCAR as part of their marketing strategy and the trend is increasing. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies investing in NASCAR increased seven percent in 2015 versus prior year; and is a 20 percent improvement versus 2008.\nWe believe that our presence in key metropolitan statistical areas, year-round event schedule, impressive portfolio of major motorsports events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing corporate marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships. Companies are demanding more quantifiable return on investment from their sports marketing strategies and our company is focused on delivering enhanced value through our strategic initiatives. This includes enhanced facilities, more frequent and diverse content at our facilities, and deeper understanding of and integration with our customers' business, among other things.\nFor fiscal 2015, total actual ISC corporate sales exceeded our 2015 target by 2.8 percent and surpassed prior year by 3.1 percent making this the second successive year of growing corporate revenues since the Great Recession. All NASCAR Sprint Cup and Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event entitlements were secured for the 2015 fiscal year, which allowed the sales team to focus more resources on media advertising, prospecting and growing official status categories. We believe this demonstrates the value proposition for our corporate partners is stronger than ever.\nLooking forward to 2016, we are very encouraged by organic growth of corporate sales and new sales boosted by strong corporate demand from the grand opening of DAYTONA Rising. We also continue to see longer deal terms that provide greater long-term income visibility, further allows our sales team to focus on incremental revenue generation, and more time for sponsor activation. As of early January 2016, we have sold all but one NASCAR Sprint Cup race entitlement and four Xfinity Series entitlements and have secured 75.0 percent of our total 2016 corporate sales target compared to 74.0 percent at this point in 2015. Not only are we pacing ahead of prior year sales as a percent of our full year target, but the 2016 target is more than 11 percent higher than 2015. For DAYTONA Rising, we have secured four long-term founding partnerships with Toyota, Florida Hospital, Chevrolet, and Sunoco, all of them equal or exceed ten year relationships.\nTelevision Broadcast and Ancillary Media Rights\nDomestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees are ISC's largest revenue source, accounting for approximately 48.7 percent of 2015 total revenues.\nIn August 2013, NASCAR finalized multi-platform broadcast rights agreements with NBCUniversal ( NBC\u201d) and FOX Broadcasting Company (\"FOX\") for 10 years, beginning in 2015 through the 2024 season, for the broadcast and related rights for NASCAR's three national touring series. Financial terms were not disclosed but leading industry sources estimate the combined agreements value at approximately $8.2 billion over the 10 years. The agreements include Spanish-language rights and 'TV Everywhere rights', which will allow NASCAR content to stream over the broadcasters' affiliated digital platforms.\nFOX has exclusive rights to the first 16 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series point races beginning each year with the prestigious DAYTONA 500. In addition, FOX retains the rights to the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, The Sprint Unlimited, Can-Am Duel, 14 NASCAR Xfinity Series events and the entire NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. NBC has exclusive rights to the final 20 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series points races including NASCAR's playoffs - the Chase for the Sprint Cup, final 19 NASCAR Xfinity Series events, select NASCAR Regional & Touring Series events and other live content beginning in 2015. In total, NASCAR will have 17 Sprint Cup races on network television in 2016, the same as 2015.\nNASCAR's solid ratings, the strong demand for live sports programming and the proliferation of on-demand content were significant factors for NASCAR signing the largest broadcast rights deal in the sport's 66-year history.\nIn August 2013, FOX debuted its 24-hour Fox Sports 1 network to compete with ESPN. Fox Sports 1 is available in approximately 85 million television households. In addition to NASCAR, Fox Sports 1 has new or renewed deals for Major League Baseball, college football and basketball, Ultimate Fighting Championship, Major League Soccer (\"MLS\"), United States Golf Association, as well as other sports. Fox Sports 1 represents the latest in the long migration of marquee sports from broadcast television to cable/satellite, who generally can support a higher investment due to subscriber fees that are not available to traditional networks. In 2015, Fox Sports 1 broadcast seven live NASCAR Sprint Cup events and eleven NASCAR Xfinity events. NASCAR events and content are consistently among the highest rated programming on Fox Sports 1.\nNBC Sports Group possesses an unparalleled collection of television rights agreements, and in addition to NASCAR partners with some of the most prestigious sports properties in the world including the International Olympic Committee and United States Olympic Committee, the NFL, NHL, PGA TOUR, The R&A, PGA of America, Churchill Downs, Premier League, Tour de France, French Open, Formula One, IndyCar and many more. The sports media company consists of a unique array of sports assets, including NBC Sports, NBC Olympics, NBC Sports Network (\"NBCSN\") , Golf Channel, 10 NBC Sports Regional Networks, NBC Sports Radio and NBC Sports Digital (Sports Live Extra). NBC Sports Network is in approximately 84.0 million homes.\nFor the 2015 broadcast season, NASCAR Sprint Cup was the number one or two sport of the weekend nineteen times during this span. Year over year television ratings comparisons are difficult in 2015 due to changes in the broadcast line-up and impacts of inclement weather for events in the current and/or prior year. Despite the limited comparability of raw television ratings, the sport is experiencing positive trends with both broadcast and digital consumption metrics to date.\nDuring 2015, Sprint Cup averaged 5.1 million viewers per event with 54 million total unique television viewers. Viewership on FOX increased 9 percent year over year. On Fox Sports 1, five of the top most-viewed telecasts in network history were 2015 Sprint Cup Series events.\nSprint Cup Races on NBC reached a total audience of 31 million, up +42% vs. comparable races in 2014. Five of NBCSN's top 10 most-watched telecasts in the network's history are 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup races, and NASCAR powered NBCSN to its most-watched year on record. Finally, the Sprint Cup Championship race from Miami was the most-watched NASCAR season finale in a decade and set a traffic record for NBC Sports Live Extra with over 4.0 million live minutes consumed.\nDomestic broadcast media rights fees provide significant cash flow visibility to us, race teams and NASCAR over the contract term. Television broadcast and ancillary rights fees received from NASCAR for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events conducted at our facilities under these agreements, and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue, were approximately $292.5 million, $302.9 million and $314.5 million for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Operating income generated by these media rights were approximately $213.0 million, $220.1 million and $228.4 million for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nAs media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series sanction agreements. NASCAR event management fees ( NASCAR direct expenses\u201d) are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event. As previously discussed, included in these NASCAR direct expenses are amounts equal to 25.0 percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events, as part of NASCAR event management fees (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition\u201d). The NASCAR event management fees are contracted from 2016 through 2020 under the five-year sanction agreements (see Sanctioning Bodies) and paid to NASCAR to contribute to the support and growth of the sport of NASCAR stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to NASCAR. As such, we do not expect these costs to materially decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income.\nThe current dynamic media landscape is diversifying how people consume media content. An internet trends study from June of 2015, reported that internet usage by adults age 18+ had grown an average of 11.0 percent per year from 2008 to 2015 representing an average of over 5 hours a day usage in 2015. Additionally, the study showed that consumption via mobile\ndevices grew from 12.0 percent of that time to more than 50.0 percent of the time spent on-line. Traditional media like television and radio still make up a majority of the average time spent consuming media content per adult day, but digital media consumption whether using a desktop or mobile device now equals more than one-third average daily time consuming audio and video content and projected to continue growing. These statistics skew higher for younger demographics.\nA key plank of NASCAR's strategy is to grow and measure all of the potential ways that people can consume media, whether through traditional television viewership, dynamic web/mobile content, and/or through social-media channels. NASCAR continually makes enhancements to NASCAR.com and NASCAR Mobile apps that strengthen the Industry's digital presence. In addition, NASCAR also created the Fan and Media Engagement Center to better understand digital conversations and optimize engagement with the social community. In the third year of managing its digital rights in-house, NASCAR experienced significant growth, measuring 1.1 billion aggregate page views across NASCAR.com, NASCAR mobile web and NASCAR Mobile apps in 2015. The billion plus page view milestone marks a 20 percent year-over-year increase in engagement on the platform, according to data from Adobe Omniture SiteCatalyst. Through the 2015 NASCAR season, NASCAR.com averaged 1.4 million unique visitors on NASCAR Sprint Cup race days; and across all digital platforms, race day metrics increased +2.0 percent for unique visitors, +14 percent for page views, and +7.0 percent for video views. On the social media front in 2015, NASCAR's Facebook and Twitter accounts combined to generate over 4.1 billion impressions this year, or up +52.0 percent versus 2014. Overall social impressions averaged 25.2 million per race day with growth in Facebook, Twitter and Instagram followers at seasons end versus the beginning of 2015. We expect all these channels will continue to grow and the industry is well positioned to engage and monetize these digital channels as our fans (mirroring society-at-large) consume more content via these channels. Along with NASCAR, we closely monitor changes in the television and media broadcast environment including announcements in 2015 by Apple, Amazon (Fire TV), DishNetwork (Sling TV), HBO (HBO Now) and others regarding direct to consumer ('a la carte' or 'Over the Top') content offerings. This trend is expected to continue and view potential shifts in media consumption as positive for both the consumer and NASCAR, providing more rich and diverse ways to consume the NASCAR product and interact with our fans.\nSanctioning Bodies\nOur success has been, and is expected to remain, dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities, particularly with NASCAR, whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately 88.8 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2015. NASCAR continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of their portfolio of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand, resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators. We believe that realignments have provided, and will continue to provide, incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport's exposure in highly desirable markets, which we believe benefits the sport's fans, teams, sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters.\nOn October 26, 2015, we entered into five year sanction agreements with NEM, an affiliate of NASCAR, for the promotion of the Company's inventory of NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series events. In 2016, we will conduct the following events: 21 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events, 14 NASCAR Xfinity Series events, and 9 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series events. Each Sanction Agreement is for a term of five years. Other than the term, the Sanction Agreements are substantially similar to those entered into in previous years. The Sanction Agreements contain annual increases of between three and four percent in media rights fees for each sanctioned event conducted, and provide a specific percentage of media rights fees to be paid to competitors. The Sanction Agreements also provide for annual increases in sanction fees and non-media rights related prize and point fund monies (to be paid to competitors) of approximately four percent annually over the term of the Sanction Agreements. NASCAR and NEM are controlled by members of the France Family Group which controls approximately 72.0 percent of the combined voting power of the outstanding stock of the Company, as of January 31, 2015, and some members of which serve as directors and officers of International Speedway Corporation. The Company strives to ensure, and management believes that, the terms of the Sanction Agreements are no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained in arms-length negotiation. Collectively, the media rights fees, sanction fees and non-media prize and point fund fees that we pay are referred to as NASCAR Event Management fees.\nMerchandise Operations\nIn 2015, NASCAR and NASCAR Team Properties announced a 10-year agreement with Fanatics, to operate NASCAR's entire at-track merchandise business and deliver fans an enhanced, experiential at-track shopping environment. As part of the agreement, Fanatics will be the exclusive retailer of NASCAR and driver merchandise at trackside for all 38 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events. In addition, Fanatics also contracted with us for 10 years of exclusive retail merchandise rights for our track trademarks and certain other intellectual property at all of our tracks. The new trackside retail model operated by Fanatics will evolve from using solely haulers for each specific team or driver to displaying all merchandise in a superstore retail environment supported by, in instances, smaller satellite retail touch points around the track. The new model will provide a more personal and convenient shopping experience for race fans. We believe this improved trackside merchandise model, combined with an upgraded on-line and mobile experience, will better position us and the industry to maximize merchandise\nsales while delivering top quality experience to our fans. Consequently, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Americrown and MA, will no longer provide at track merchandise to fans at motorsports events and therefore will no longer recognize related revenues. Instead, we will receive a percentage of sales from Fanatics, recorded as part of Food, Beverage and Merchandise Revenue.\nFor fiscal 2015, the following occurred:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>food, beverage and merchandise revenue and expense reduction of approximately $27.5 million and $22.0 million respectively\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>elimination of general and administrative expenses related to trackside merchandise operations of approximately $1.2 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduction in operating income of approximately $4.3 million related to this new merchandise business model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Accounting rules require us to recognize revenue and expense related to the sale of approximately $6.4 million of merchandise inventory to Fanatics at cost, which has been included in the aforementioned fiscal 2015 results.\nGoing forward, we expect that the new merchandising model will continue to enhance the event experience for our fans and grow the operating margin contribution from the merchandise line of business. Comparable merchandise sales during 2015 utilizing the new superstore shopping model were approximately 10.0 percent greater than sales using the 'hauler' model employed historically, a positive trend we believe will continue as Fanatics further integrates.\nCapital Improvements\nEnhancing the live event experience for our guests is a key strategic pillar to drive future growth. We compete for the consumers' discretionary dollar with other entertainment options such as concerts and other major sporting events not just motorsports events. In addition, fans continue to demonstrate willingness to pay for more unique, immersive, and segmented experiences that cannot be duplicated at-home. Today's consumer wants improved traffic flow, comfortable and wider seating, clean and available restroom facilities, more points of sale, enhanced audio and visual engagement, social zones and greater connectivity. Providing these enhancements often requires capital reinvestment.\nWe are confident that our focus on driving incremental earnings by improving the fan experience leads to increased ticket sales and better ticket pricing power, growth in sponsorship and hospitality sales, solidifying prospects for longer-term growth in broadcast media rights fees agreements, and greater potential to capture market share. As such, ISC's Board of Directors endorsed a capital reinvestment plan for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017 not to exceed $600.0 million. The five-year capital reinvestment plan encompasses capital expenditures for ISC's 13 major sports facilities, including DAYTONA Rising (see \"DAYTONA Rising: Reimagining an American Icon\"), and commitments to undertake ONE DAYTONA (see \"ONE DAYTONA\"). We continue to elevate our Daytona brand to ensure that it remains the pinnacle of motorsports facilities, which will generate enhanced profitability and cash flow to the Company. In our five year reinvestment plan, we also allocate appropriate capital spending on other projects for maintenance, safety and regulatory requirements, and guest experience enhancements. We are confident that by continuing to deliver memorable guest experiences, attractive pricing and fantastic racing, we will generate increased revenues and bottom-line results.\nWhile we focus on allocating our capital to generate returns in excess of our cost of capital, certain of our capital improvement investments may not provide immediate, directly traceable near term positive returns on invested capital but over the longer term will better enable us to effectively compete with other entertainment venues for consumer and corporate spending.\nGrowth Strategies\nOur growth strategies also continuously explores ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions and external developments that offer attractive financial returns and leverage our core competencies. A prime example is our joint venture to develop and operate a Hollywood-themed and branded entertainment destination facility overlooking turn two of Kansas Speedway (see Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway\u201d).\nThe Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway provides positive cash flow to us and positive equity income in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015. We expect for our 2016 fiscal year that our share of the cash flow from the casino's operations will be approximately $27.0 million to $28.0 million dollars.\nWe continue to pursue a mixed-use entertainment development named ONE DAYTONA, located on property we own located directly across from our Daytona motorsports entertainment facility (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - ONE DAYTONA\u201d).\nWe remain interested in pursuing further ancillary developments at certain of our other motorsports facilities which enhance our core business, are market-driven, and provide a prudent return on investment.\nCurrent Operations Comparison\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the indicated periods, certain selected statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Admissions, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorsports and other event related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food, beverage and merchandise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASCAR event management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorsports and other event related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food, beverage and merchandise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on retirements of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income from equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2014\nThe comparison of fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 is impacted by the following factors:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we hosted the Phish Magnaball music festival at Watkins Glen, for which there was no comparable event in the prior year.

Prior to January 31, 2014, MA was accounted for as an equity investment in our financial statements. As a result of SMI's abandonment of their interest in MA, we recorded other income of approximately $5.4 million representing the fair value of MA, over the carrying value, as of January 31, 2014.

The increase is largely attributable to increases in television broadcast revenue of approximately $11.6 million. Also contributing to the increase were advertising, hospitality and sponsorship revenues of approximately $4.2 million, other ancillary motorsports revenue totaling approximately $1.5 million, as well as the aforementioned music festivals totaling approximately $0.8 million.\nFood, beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately $25.6 million, or 35.1 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the aforementioned transition of merchandise operations of approximately $27.5 million. Slightly offsetting the decrease were concession sales of approximately $1.8 million related to the aforementioned Phish Magnaball music festival held in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, for which there was no comparable event in fiscal 2014.\nNASCAR event management fees increased by approximately $4.9 million, or 3.0 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase includes approximately $3.0 million attributable to increases in television broadcast rights fees, for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events held during the period as standard NASCAR sanctioning agreements require a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees to be paid to competitors. The remaining increase is attributable to higher contracted NEM fees.\nMotorsports and other event related expense increased by approximately $2.9 million, or 2.2 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to personnel related expenses, incremental costs for certain events largely driven by inclement weather, as well as other purchased services. Motorsports and other event related expenses as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports and other event related revenue remained consistent at approximately 22.5 percent for fiscal 2015, as compared to 22.8 percent for the same period in the prior year.\nFood, beverage and merchandise expense decreased approximately $19.8 million, or 34.0 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease is predominately attributable to the aforementioned transition of merchandise operations of approximately $22.0 million. Slightly offsetting the decrease were concession related expenses of approximately $1.6 million attributed to the aforementioned Phish Magnaball music festival held in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, for which there was no comparable event in fiscal 2014. In addition, motorsports related concessions and catering yielded an increase of approximately $0.6 million. Food, beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food, beverage and merchandise revenue increased to approximately 81.4 percent for fiscal 2015, as compared to 79.9 percent for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin is primarily a result of the aforementioned transition in merchandising operations, however, excluding this activity, food, beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food, beverage and merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period in 2014 due to increased catering revenues driven by an approximate 3.0 percent increase in prices, slightly offset by increased spoilage due to inclement weather affecting certain events.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased approximately $3.1 million, or 2.8 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to approximately $3.6 million of certain administrative costs and ancillary facility operations, as well as a net decrease to our general liability insurance reserve in the prior year period of approximately $1.1 million, for which there is no comparable reduction in the current period. Slightly offsetting the increase was approximately $0.9 million of costs related to real and tangible property taxes and $0.7 million of non-recurring costs related to the aforementioned transition in merchandising operations. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to approximately 17.3 percent for fiscal 2015, as compared to 16.7 percent for fiscal 2014. The margin decrease for the period is primarily due one-time, non-recurring administrative costs related to DAYTONA Rising and to adjustments in our general liability insurance reserves in the 2014 period.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $4.4 million, or 4.8 percent, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Approximately $11.9 million of the increase relates to new assets placed in service associated with DAYTONA Rising, and approximately$5.5 million is attributable to the continued shortening of the service lives of certain assets that will eventually be retired associated with DAYTONA Rising. Also contributing to the increase is approximately $1.3 million attributable to the shortening of service lives of certain assets associated with the repaving of Watkins Glen. Offsetting these increases are approximately $14.3 million related to assets that have been fully depreciated, or removed from service.\nLosses on retirements of long-lived assets of approximately $16.0 million during fiscal 2015 is primarily due to demolition costs in connection with DAYTONA Rising and other capital improvements.\nInterest income during fiscal 2015 decreased approximately $2.0 million as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease is predominately due to a settlement reached in fiscal 2014 related to prior years interest associated with a long-term receivable. There was no comparable event in fiscal 2015.\nInterest expense increased approximately $0.4 million, or 4.4 percent, in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was predominately due to slightly lower capitalized interest associated with DAYTONA Rising.\nEquity in net income from equity investments in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, represents our 50.0 percent equity investments in Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway (see Equity and Other Investments\u201d).\nOur effective income tax rate increased from approximately 33.0 percent to approximately 37.7 percent during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 (see Income Taxes\u201d).\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income decreased approximately $10.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nComparison of Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2013\nThe comparison of fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 is impacted by the following factors:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Drag racing events were held at Auto Club Speedway in fiscal 2014 that were not held in fiscal 2013;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The second annual Faster Horses music festival held during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 includes consolidation of concessions revenue and expense as compared to similar services provided by a third party for this event held the same period in fiscal 2013;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 31, 2014, SMI abandoned its interest and rights in MA, consequently bringing our ownership of MA to 100.0 percent.

The increase is largely attributable to increases in television broadcast revenue of approximately $12.1 million. Also contributing to the increase were increased hospitality revenues of approximately $1.5 million, as well as the aforementioned drag race events held at Auto Club Speedway totaling approximately $1.0 million. Partially offsetting the increase was lower MRN advertising and Sprint Vision revenues of approximately $2.5 million, as well as decreased sponsorship revenues of approximately $2.2 million, and an adjustment in the 2013 first quarter to increase the ancillary rights fees attributable to fiscal 2012, of approximately $1.7 million, with no comparable adjustment in fiscal 2014.\nFood, beverage and merchandise revenue increased approximately $28.8 million, or 65.5 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is predominately due to the aforementioned consolidation of MA, of approximately $25.7 million. Also contributing to the increase were concession sales of approximately $1.1 million related to the aforementioned non-motorsports event held in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, for which there was no comparable event in fiscal 2013.\nNASCAR event management fees increased by approximately $3.6 million, or 2.3 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increases are primarily due to increases in television broadcast rights fees for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events held during the period as standard NASCAR sanctioning agreements require a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees to be paid to competitors.\nMotorsports related expense increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 1.8 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is primarily due to personnel related expenses, incremental costs for certain events largely driven by inclement weather, and the aforementioned events held in fiscal 2014 for which there were no comparable events in fiscal 2013, as well as advertising costs. Partially offsetting the increase were decreases in net purchased services of approximately $0.1 million. Motorsports related expenses as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue remained consistent at approximately 22.8 percent for fiscal 2014, as compared to 22.7 percent for the same period in the prior year.\nFood, beverage and merchandise expense increased approximately $25.1 million, or 75.8 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is predominately attributable to the aforementioned consolidation of MA which increased related expenses by approximately $21.4 million. Also contributing to the increase were increased catering and merchandise sales, as well as concession sales related to the aforementioned non-motorsports event held in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, for which there was no comparable event in fiscal 2013. Food, beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food, beverage and merchandise revenue increased to approximately 79.9 percent for fiscal 2014, as compared to 75.3 percent for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin is primarily a result of the aforementioned consolidation of MA and the aforementioned non-motorsports event. Excluding MA and the non-motorsports event, food, beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food, beverage and merchandise revenue is comparable to the same periods in 2013.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased approximately $3.6 million, or 3.5 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is predominately due to certain administrative costs and ancillary facility operations, totaling approximately $7.9 million, of which approximately $2.5 million was related to MA. Partially offsetting the increase was certain ongoing carrying costs related to our Staten Island property, of approximately $2.8 million, that occurred in fiscal 2013, for which there were no comparable costs in the same period of fiscal 2014. Also contributing to offsetting the increase was a net decrease to our general liability reserve of approximately $1.5 million, due to certain claims not reaching their full exposure, as was estimated, prior to being resolved. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased negligibly to approximately 16.7 percent for fiscal 2014, as compared to 17.1 percent for fiscal 2013. The margin improvement was predominately due to the aforementioned adjustments in our general liability insurance reserves in the 2014 period as well as carrying costs related to our Staten Island property\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $3.6 million, or 3.9 percent, in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to the service lives of certain assets associated with DAYTONA Rising and grandstand seating at Talladega and Richmond whose lives were reduced in the fiscal 2013 period and became fully depreciated in the same period of fiscal 2014. Partially offsetting the decrease are new assets going into service, predominately associated with DAYTONA Rising.\nLosses on retirements of long-lived assets of approximately $10.1 million during fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to demolition costs in connection with DAYTONA Rising, capacity management initiatives and other capital improvements. The losses on retirements of long-lived assets of approximately $16.6 million in fiscal 2013 is primarily attributable to the removal of certain assets not fully depreciated in connection with DAYTONA Rising and grandstand seating at Talladega, as well as guest enhancements at our other facilities.\nInterest income during fiscal 2014 increased approximately $2.0 million as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is predominately due to a settlement reached in fiscal 2014 related to prior years interest associated with a long-term receivable.\nInterest expense decreased approximately $6.0 million, or 39.7 percent, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was predominately due to higher capitalized interest associated with DAYTONA Rising.\nEquity in net income from equity investments in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, represents our 50.0 percent equity investments in Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway (see Equity and Other Investments\u201d). We did not recognize any net income or loss from our equity investment in MA in fiscal 2014 or in fiscal 2013 (see Equity and Other Investments\u201d).\nOur effective income tax rate decreased from approximately 38.0 percent to approximately 33.0 percent during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 (see Income Taxes\u201d).\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income increased approximately $22.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, and return of capital through payments of an annual cash dividend and repurchase of our shares under our Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, we have used the proceeds from offerings of our Class A Common Stock, the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects.

In addition, as of November 30, 2015, we have approximately $296.0 million available to draw upon\nunder our 2012 Credit Facility, if needed. See Future Liquidity\u201d for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity.\nAllocation of capital is driven by our long-term strategic planning and initiatives that encompass our mission, vision and values. Our primary uses of capital are to maintain modest debt levels that are consistent with our current investment grade debt rating from Standard and Poor's. We will invest in our facilities to improve the guest experience and we will make investments in strategic projects that complement our core business and provide value for our shareholders, all of which is balanced with returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nCapital Allocation\nWe have established a long-term capital allocation plan to ensure it generates sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, and return of capital through payments of an annual cash dividend and repurchase of our shares under our Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, we have used the proceeds from offerings of our Class A Common Stock, the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects.\nThe current capital allocation plan contemplates the following:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital expenditures remaining under the existing $600.0 million capital expenditure plan adopted by our Board of Directors in June 2013, totals approximately $170.0 million for fiscal 2016 and 2017, consisting of remaining payments to contractors for the completion of DAYTONA Rising and certain planned capital projects at our remaining 12 motorsports facilities (see \"Capital Spending\").

To facilitate our 2016 plan, during the upcoming open trading window we will request special committee of our Board of Directors to revise parameters under our Rule 10b-5 open market share repurchase program. The objective of the revised parameters is to buy back shares on an opportunistic, but consistent, basis in 2016. The open market program currently has $61.7 million remaining under the total $330.0 million authorization. We will review our return of capital programs and make adjustments, if necessary, on a quarterly basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to sources of working capital and available borrowings, our ability to execute our capital allocation plans are supported by the following:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Federal tax legislation passed in December 2015 provides for extension of 7-year depreciation for tax purposes on certain assets placed in service during fiscal 2015 through 2016, and bonus depreciation on capital expenditures placed in service 2015 through 2019. While the tax legislation does not impact the Company's overall tax liability, it does impact the timing of the annual payment of cash taxes. Cash taxes paid for federal and state taxes in fiscal 2014 and 2015 were approximately $51.3 million and $45.0 million, respectively. As a result of this legislation, which was passed subsequent the Company's fiscal 2015 year-end, but retroactive for all assets placed in service during 2015, we currently estimate a net cash tax refund for fiscal 2016 between approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, primarily attributable to depreciation for assets placed in service related to DAYTONA Rising, and cash tax payments for fiscal 2017 between approximately $55.0 million to $60.0 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Anticipated receipt of final payment of approximately $66.4 million, plus interest, from the outstanding note related to the sale of our Staten Island property;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The aforementioned represents certain components of the Company's capital allocation plan for 2016. This capital allocation plan is reviewed annually, or more frequently, if necessary, based on changes in business conditions.\nCapital Expenditures\nAs discussed in Future Trends in Operating Results,\u201d an important strategy for our future growth will come from investing in our major motorsports facilities to enhance the live event experience and better enable us to effectively compete with other entertainment venues for consumer and corporate spending.\nIn June 2013, ISC's board of directors endorsed a capital allocation plan for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017 to not exceed $600.0 million in capital expenditures over that period. The five-year capital expenditure plan encompasses all capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for ISC's 13 major motorsports facilities, including approximately $400.0 million for DAYTONA Rising.\nCapital expenditures for projects at existing facilities, including those related to DAYTONA Rising, was approximately $155.0 million for ISC's 2015 fiscal year. In comparison, the Company spent approximately $183.9 million on capital expenditures for projects at its existing facilities in fiscal 2014. Remaining capital expenditures associated with the $600.0 million capital expenditure plan will total approximately $170.0 million for fiscal 2016 and 2017, of which approximately $67.2 million related to the timing of remaining construction payments associated with the completion of DAYTONA Rising in January 2016.\nWe review the capital expenditure program periodically and modify it as required to meet current business needs.\nFuture Liquidity\nGeneral\nAs discussed in Future Trends in Operating Results,\u201d we compete for discretionary spending and leisure time with many other entertainment alternatives and are subject to factors that generally affect the recreation, leisure and sports industry, including general economic conditions. Our operations are also sensitive to factors that affect corporate budgets. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, employment levels, business conditions, interest and taxation rates, relative commodity prices, and changes in consumer tastes and spending habits. These factors may negatively impact year-over-year comparability for our revenue categories for the full year, with the exception of domestic broadcast media rights fees. While we are sustaining the significant cost reductions implemented subsequent to the unprecedented adverse economic conditions that began in 2008, we do not expect further significant cost reductions.\nOur cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket, hospitality, merchandise, catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships. We believe that cash flows from operations, along with existing cash, cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operations of our major motorsports facilities for the foreseeable future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the previously discussed five-year capital expenditures plan at our existing facilities, which includes DAYTONA Rising, as well as any future fan and competitor safety, critical maintenance and regulatory compliance spending;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>additional capital expenditures related to phase I of the ONE DAYTONA project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payments required in connection with the funding of the Unified Government's debt service requirements related to the TIF bonds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payments related to our existing debt service commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>contributions in connection with any future expansion of the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our annual dividend payment and share repurchases under our Stock Purchase Plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We remain interested in pursuing acquisition and/or development opportunities that would increase shareholder value, of which the timing, size, success and associated potential capital commitments, are unknown at this time. Accordingly, a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and/or equity financings. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms.\nWhile we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future, our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors. In addition to local, national, and global economic and financial market conditions, consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows. General economic conditions may be significantly and negatively impacted by global events such as terrorist attacks, prospects of war, or global economic uncertainty. Any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance, security or other related matters. Also, our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis. The items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse effect on our financial success and future cash flow.\nLong-Term Obligations and Commitments\nOur $65.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes ( 4.63 percent Senior Notes\u201d) bear interest at 4.63 percent and are due January 2021, require semi-annual interest payments on January 18 and July 18 through their maturity. The 4.63 percent Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at any time or from time to time at redemption prices as defined in the indenture. Certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the 4.63 percent Senior Notes. Certain restrictive covenants of the 4.63 percent Senior Notes require that the Company's ratio of its Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to its Consolidated EBITDA (\"leverage ratio\") does not exceed 3.50 to 1.0, and its Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (\"interest coverage ratio\") is not less than 2.0 to 1.0. In addition the Company may not permit the aggregate of certain Priority Debt to exceed 15.0 percent of its Consolidated Net Worth. The 4.63 percent Senior Notes contain various other affirmative and negative restrictive covenants including, among others, limitations on liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations and certain transactions with affiliates. As of November 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its various restrictive covenants. At November 30, 2015, outstanding principal on the 4.63 percent Senior Notes was approximately $65.0 million.\nOur $100.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes ( 3.95 percent Senior Notes\u201d) bear interest at 3.95 percent and are due September 2024. The 3.95 percent Senior Notes require semi-annual interest payments on March 13 and September 13 through their maturity. The 3.95 percent Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at any time or from time to time at redemption prices as defined in the indenture. Certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the 3.95 percent Senior Notes. Certain restrictive covenants of the 3.95 percent Senior Notes require that the Company's leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50 to 1.0, and its interest coverage ratio is not less than 2.0 to 1.0. In addition the Company may not permit the aggregate of certain Priority Debt to exceed 15.0 percent of its Consolidated Net Worth. The 3.95 percent Senior Notes contain various other affirmative and negative restrictive covenants including, among others, limitations on liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations and certain transactions with affiliates. As of November 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its various restrictive covenants. At November 30, 2015, outstanding principal on the 3.95 percent Senior Notes was approximately $100.0 million.\nThe term loan ( 6.25 percent Term Loan\u201d), related to our International Motorsports Center, has a 25 year term due October 2034, an interest rate of 6.25 percent, and a current monthly payment of approximately $323,000 principal and interest. At November 30, 2015, the outstanding principal on the 6.25 percent Term Loan was approximately $48.7 million.\nAt November 30, 2015, outstanding TIF bonds totaled approximately $54.6 million, net of the unamortized discount, which is comprised of a $5.4 million principal amount, 6.15 percent term bond due December 1, 2017 and a $49.7 million principal amount, 6.75 percent term bond due December 1, 2027. The TIF bonds are repaid by the Unified Government with payments made in lieu of property taxes ( Funding Commitment\u201d) by our wholly owned subsidiary, Kansas Speedway Corporation ( KSC\u201d). Principal (mandatory redemption) payments per the Funding Commitment are payable by KSC on October 1 of each year. The semi-annual interest component of the Funding Commitment is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. KSC granted a mortgage and security interest in the Kansas project for its Funding Commitment obligation.\nIn October 2002, the Unified Government issued subordinate sales tax special obligation revenue bonds ( 2002 STAR Bonds\u201d) totaling approximately $6.3 million to reimburse us for certain construction already completed on the second phase of the Kansas Speedway project and to fund certain additional construction. The 2002 STAR Bonds, which require annual debt service payments and are due December 1, 2022, will be retired with state and local taxes generated within the Kansas Speedway's boundaries and are not our obligation. KSC has agreed to guarantee the payment of principal, any required premium and interest on the 2002 STAR Bonds. At November 30, 2015, the Unified Government had approximately $1.2 million in 2002 STAR Bonds outstanding. Under a keepwell agreement, we have agreed to provide financial assistance to KSC, if necessary, to support its guarantee of the 2002 STAR Bonds.\nThe 2012 Credit Facility contains a feature that allows us to increase the credit facility from $300.0 million to a total of $500.0 million, subject to certain conditions, provides for separate sub-limits of $25.0 million for standby letters of credit and $10.0 million for swing line loans. The 2012 Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in November 2017. Interest accrues, at the Company's option, at either LIBOR plus 100.0 - 162.5 basis points or a base rate loan at the highest of i) Wells Fargo Bank's prime lending rate, ii) the Federal Funds rate, as in effect from time to time, plus 0.5 percent, and iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.0 percent. The 2012 Credit Facility also contains a commitment fee ranging from 0.125 percent to 0.225 percent of unused amounts available for borrowing. The interest rate margin on the LIBOR borrowings and commitment fee are variable depending on the better of the Company's debt rating as determined by specified rating agencies or its leverage ratio. Certain of the Company's wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors on the 2012 Credit Facility. The 2012 Credit Facility requires that the Company's leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50 to 1.0 (4.0 to 1.0 for the four quarters ending after any Permitted Acquisition), and its interest coverage ratio is not less than 2.5 to 1.0. The 2012 Credit Facility also contains various other affirmative and negative restrictive covenants including, among others, limitations on indebtedness, investments, sales of assets, certain transactions with affiliates, entering into certain restrictive agreements and making certain restricted payments as\ndetailed in the agreement. As of November 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its various restrictive covenants. At November 30, 2015, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nAt November 30, 2015 we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt and to make payments under operating agreements, leases and commercial commitments in the form of guarantees and unused lines of credit. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows as of November 30, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligations Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Motorsports entertainment facility operating agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Cash Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial commitment expirations are as follows as of November 30, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commitment Expiration by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDAYTONA Rising: Reimagining an American Icon\nDAYTONA Rising is the redevelopment of the frontstretch at Daytona, ISC's 56-year-old flagship motorsports facility, to enhance the event experience for our fans, marketing partners, broadcasters and the motorsports industry. We continue to anticipate DAYTONA Rising to cost approximately $400.0 million, excluding capitalized interest, which we expect to fund from cash on hand, cash from our operations.\nAs part of DAYTONA Rising, we entered into a Design-Build Agreement with Barton Malow Company ( Barton Malow\u201d), which obligates us to pay Barton Malow approximately $316.0 million for the completion of the work described in the Design-Build Agreement. The amount is a stipulated sum to be paid for the work, which may not change unless we request a change in the scope of work. The Design-Build Agreement contains certain provisions and representations usual and customary for agreements of this type, including, among others, provisions regarding liquidated damages to be assessed for work that is not completed according to the agreed upon schedule, provisions regarding payment schedules, and provisions regarding bonding and liability insurance policies applicable to the work. In addition, the Design-Build Agreement contains customary provisions regarding termination, review and inspection of the work, warranties and the use of subcontractors.\nOn January 12, 2016, we received our temporary certificate of occupancy which allows us to begin moving into the facility and fully prepare for the upcoming race season. The world's first motorsports stadium will be ready for its debut later this month at the Rolex 24 At DAYTONA Weekend.\nThe vision for DAYTONA Rising places an emphasis on enhancing the complete fan experience, beginning with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances, or injectors. Each injector will lead directly to a series of escalators and elevators that will transport fans to any of three different concourse levels, each featuring spacious and strategically-placed social \"neighborhoods\" along the nearly mile-long frontstretch.\nA total of 11 neighborhoods, each measuring the size of a football field, will enable fans to meet and socialize during events without missing any on-track action, thanks to dozens of strategically-placed video screens in every neighborhood. The central neighborhood, dubbed the \"World Center of Racing,\" features open sight-lines enabling fans to catch all the on-track action while celebrating the history of Daytona International Speedway and its many unforgettable moments throughout more than 50 years of racing.\nEvery seat in Daytona's frontstretch will be replaced with wider, more comfortable seating that will provide pristine sight-lines. There will also be twice as many restrooms and three times as many concessions throughout the facility. During Budweiser Speedweeks 2015, fans experienced some of DAYTONA Rising's new amenities including first-ever vertical transportation,\napproximately 40,000 new seats on the frontstretch near Turn 1, and new concessions and restrooms. For the 2015 Coke Zero 400 in July, we opened an additional 10,000 new seats and supporting amenities in Turn 4.\nIn addition to improving the overall fan experience, the corporate entertainment platform at Daytona will be completely transformed. Corporate hospitality will be moved into permanent structures inside the new stadium, providing premier facilities for entertaining throughout our events. Over 60 new trackside corporate suites will provide our premium guests with breathtaking views and first-class amenities befitting the World Center of Racing.\u201d\nSince commencement of construction, four Founding Partners have been announced:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Toyota;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Florida Hospital;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Chevrolet; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sunoco.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> With each partnerships extending over 10 years, the Founding partners receive sponsorship rights for a dedicated injector, as well as approximately 20,000 square feet of innovative fan engagement space that will enhance the overall guest experience, and nearly 50,000 square feet of interior and exterior branding space.\nIn addition to the four Founding Partners, we have entered into many additional corporate partnerships including:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NextEra Energy Resources - includes the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race entitlement, extends our renewable energy credit purchases designed to off-set the Speedway's carbon footprint and, with the newly signed agreement with NextEra Energy and Florida Power & Light, adds three new on-site solar arrays;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rolex - extends the iconic Rolex brand's role as the title sponsor of the annual Rolex 24 At DAYTONA sports car race and Official Timepiece of Daytona International Speedway and receive naming rights for the new DAYTONA Rising frontstretch lounge and suite level as well as enhanced branding opportunities throughout the redeveloped Speedway;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fifth Third Bank - will become the official bank of the World Center of Racing\u201d and will integrate its ATMs into the redeveloped Speedway beginning in 2016, provide Fifth Third Bank with fan engagement and corporate hospitality opportunities for entertaining guests at the Speedway, the ability to use certain marks and logos in Fifth Third Bank promotions, and serve as an official partner of the DAYTONA 500 and the Coke Zero 400 Powered By Coca-Cola;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>BRP - title sponsor for the 150-mile qualifying races for the DAYTONA 500, Can-Am Duel At Daytona, which finalizes the starting lineup for the DAYTONA 500; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PowerShares QQQ - the multi-year partnership will serve as the title sponsor for the NASCAR XFINITY Series season opener at Daytona International Speedway, a 120-lap, 300-mile race which will be known as the PowerShares QQQ 300.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that by providing our fans with a better experience as well as an expansive platform for our marketing partners, including an elevated hospitality experience, DAYTONA Rising, upon completion in 2016, is expected to provide an immediate incremental lift in Daytona's revenues of approximately $20.0 million, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\u201d) lift of approximately $15.0 million, approximately $2.1 million of which was recognized in fiscal 2015, with a mid-single-digit growth rate. We also currently anticipate the project to be accretive to our net income per share within three years of completion. While these forward-looking amounts are management's projections and we believe they are reasonable, our actual results may vary from these estimates due to unanticipated changes in projected attendance, lower than expected ticket prices, and/or lower than forecasted corporate sponsorships. We do not know whether these expectations will ultimately prove correct and actual revenues and operating results may differ materially from these estimates.\nDespite not anticipating the need for additional long-term debt to fund this project, accounting rules dictate that we capitalize a portion of the interest on existing outstanding debt during the construction period. Through November 30, 2015, we recorded approximately $14.0 million of capitalized interest associated with the DAYTONA Rising project since inception.\nTotal spending incurred, exclusive of capitalized interest, relating to DAYTONA Rising was approximately$120.1 million for fiscal 2015, and is approximately $332.8 million since the inception of the project. We have identified existing assets that are expected to be impacted by the redevelopment and that those assets required accelerated depreciation, certain removal costs and losses on asset retirements, over the approximate 31-month project time span. During fiscal 2015, we recognized accelerated depreciation, certain removal costs and losses on retirements of assets totaling approximately $17.4 million, with a total of approximately $45.4 million recognized since the inception of the project.\nIn addition, our depreciation expense, related directly to DAYTONA Rising, increased incrementally by approximately $11.9 million in fiscal 2015, and is expected to increase an additional $15.0 million to $16.0 million in fiscal 2016. The incremental increase in depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 is based on the opening of approximately forty percent of the new stadium's seating capacity for Budweiser Speedweeks 2015 and an additional approximate ten percent of the new stadium's seating capacity for the 2015 Coke Zero 400.\nAs a result, our total depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 is approximately $94.7 million, and is estimated to be between approximately $100.0 million to $105.0 million annually, in fiscal 2016, and then decreasing, to approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million beginning in fiscal 2019.\nIn June 2014, House Bill 7095 was signed in Florida creating the Florida Sports Development Program, establishing a process for distributing state tax revenue for the construction or improvement of professional sports facilities. The DAYTONA Rising project was among the eligible applicants to receive sales tax incentives based on the project's capital investment and amount of sales tax generated by the facility. In 2014, we filed our application and received approval from the state's Department of Economic Opportunity. Allocation of funds for the approved applications was not considered during the 2015 session of the Florida Legislature. We have re-submitted a detailed and thorough sports incentive application to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity for consideration and will continue to pursue all options to ensure the successful outcome of this process.\nONE DAYTONA\nSince June 2013, we have pursued development of ONE DAYTONA, the proposed premier mixed use and entertainment destination across from Daytona International Speedway.\nWe have approved land use entitlements for ONE DAYTONA to allow for up to 1.4 million square feet of retail/dining/entertainment, 2,500 seats in a movie theater, 660 hotel rooms, 1,350 units of residential, 567,000 square feet of additional office space and 500,000 square feet of commercial/industrial space.\nA Community Development District (\"CDD\") has been established for the purpose of installing and maintaining public infrastructure at ONE DAYTONA. The CDD is a local, special purpose government framework authorized by Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes for managing and financing infrastructure to support community development.\nThe CDD has negotiated agreements with the City of Daytona Beach and Volusia County for a total of $40.0 million in incentives to finance a portion of the estimated $53.0 million in infrastructure required to move forward with the ONE DAYTONA project. We are currently proceeding with the leasing phase of the project while simultaneously completing the various necessary requirements for the CDD to access the incentives to start infrastructure work.\nIn March 2015, we announced Legacy Development, a leading national development group, as development consultant for ONE DAYTONA. Intensely focused on innovative destination retail and mixed-use projects, Legacy Development will work closely with ISC's development resources on the project. The Legacy Development team is a natural fit for the project, having served as the developer for Legends Outlets Kansas City, a mixed-used retail destination across from our Kansas Speedway.\nWe have refined the conceptual design for the first phase of ONE DAYTONA. This first phase will be comprised of three components: retail, dining and entertainment ( RD&E\u201d); hotels; and residential.\nThe RD&E component of phase one will be owned and operated 100% by us. The expected total square footage for the RD&E first phase is approximately 300,000 square feet. We estimate the total cost for developing phase one to be approximately $120.0 million to $150.0 million. Sources of funds will include, in addition to borrowings on our Credit Facility, the public incentives discussed above and land to be contributed to the project. Bass Pro Shops, America's most popular outdoor store, and Cobb Theatres, the highly respected Southeastern-based exhibitor, have executed leases to anchor ONE DAYTONA. We are in active discussions with other potential tenants for ONE DAYTONA and anticipate announcement of additional leases in the near future.\nShaner Hotels and Prime Hospitality Group (\"PHG\") have been selected as hotel partners. They have executed a franchise agreement with Marriott International for an exclusive 145-room full service Autograph Collection hotel at ONE DAYTONA. Shaner Hotels and Prime Hospitality have also decided to move forward with their option to build a limited service hotel within ONE DAYTONA. As part of the partnership agreement, our portion of equity will be limited to our land contribution and we will share in the profits from the joint venture.\nPrime Group has been selected as the partner for ONE DAYTONA's residential development. Following an extensive request for proposal process, ONE DAYTONA chose the Florida developer based on their command of market demographics, development experience and expert property management systems. Initial planning is already underway for a 300-unit rental\napartment community. Similar to the hotel partnership, our portion of equity will be limited to our land contribution and we will share in the profits from the joint venture.\nCommencement of the vertical construction is expected to commence in the spring of 2016. We expect our investment in phase one of ONE DAYTONA to meet or exceed our cost of capital. Any future phases will be subject to prudent business considerations.\nSpeedway Developments\nIn light of NASCAR's publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series schedule, we believe there are still potential development opportunities for public/private partnerships in new, underserved markets across the country that would create value for our shareholders. However, we are not currently pursuing any new speedway development opportunities.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and earnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), in conjunction with the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"), issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The objective of this Update is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date, while permitting entities to elect to adopt one year earlier on the original effective date. As a result, for a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn April 2015, the FASB, in conjunction with the IASB, issued ASU No. 2015-03, \"Interest - Imputation of Interest\". The objective of this Update is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in this Update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update. For a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The standard should be adopted retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented and adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We believe that the impact of adopting this new guidance will not result in a material difference in our financial position and will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, \"Interest - Imputation of Interest (Sub-Topic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements\". Given the absence of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. As with ASU No. 2015-03, for a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The standard should be adopted retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented and adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We believe that the impact of adopting this new guidance will not result in a material difference in our financial position and will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\". The objective of this Update is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this Update require that deferred assets and liabilities be classified as long-term on the balance sheet instead of separating the deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. For a public entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We believe that this treatment of deferred taxes reduces the complexity of financial reporting while improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of the financial statements. As a result we have elected to early adopt this Update prospectively as of November 30, 2015 and prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.\nFactors That May Affect Operating Results\nThis report and the documents incorporated by reference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. We derive revenues primarily from (i) admissions to motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities held at our facilities, (ii) revenue generated in conjunction with or as a result of motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities conducted at our facilities, and (iii) catering, concession and merchandising services during or as a result of these events and amusement activities.\nAdmissions, net\u201d revenue includes ticket sales for all of our racing events and other motorsports activities and amusements, net of any applicable taxes.\nMotorsports and other event related\u201d revenue primarily includes television and ancillary media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping revenues, track rental fees and fees paid by third party promoters for management of non-motorsports events.\nFood, beverage and merchandise\u201d revenue includes revenues from concession stands, direct sales of souvenirs, hospitality catering, programs and other merchandise and fees paid by third party vendors for the right to occupy space to sell souvenirs and concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities.\nDirect expenses include (i) NASCAR event management fees, (ii) motorsports and other event related expenses, which include labor, advertising, costs of competition paid to sanctioning bodies other than NASCAR and other expenses associated with the promotion of all of our motorsports and other events and activities, and (iii) food, beverage and merchandise expenses, consisting primarily of labor and costs of goods sold.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made, actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. We continually review our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation. We consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses. Our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party, if any, has the power and benefits. Therefore, we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we, or another party, have the power to direct these activities.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest, board representation and policy making decisions. We periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. We eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results.\nRevenue Recognition. Advance ticket sales and event-related revenues for future events are deferred until earned, which is generally once the events are conducted. The recognition of event-related expenses is matched with the recognition of event-related revenues.\nNASCAR contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series schedules. Event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event. Under the terms of this arrangement, NASCAR retains 10.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event as a component of its sanction fees. The promoter records 90.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records 25.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors. Ultimately, the promoter retains 65.0 percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event.\nOur revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts, with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time. Some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and/or events and include multiple specified elements, such as tickets, hospitality chalets, suites, display space and signage for each included event. The allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements, events and facilities is based on relative selling price. The sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted.\nRevenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers, internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale.\nBusiness Combinations. All business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Whether net assets or common stock is acquired, fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract-based intangible asset associated with long-term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies, such as NASCAR and IMSA series. The continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year. While individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year, a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore, in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations,\u201d are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill.\nCapitalization and Depreciation Policies. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize costs of the project, including, but not limited to, certain pre-acquisition costs, permitting costs, fees paid to architects and contractors, certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary, property taxes and interest.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also is a matter of judgment. Our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets, industry, legal and regulatory factors, and our expectations of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nInterest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project. We capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin, and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period.\nImpairments / Losses on Retirements of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which could be subject to impairments / losses on retirements. During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 we recorded before-tax charges as losses on retirements of long-lived assets primarily attributable to costs to remove certain other long-lived assets located at our motorsports facilities totaling approximately $16.6 million, $10.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively.\nAs of November 30, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment account for approximately $1.7 billion, or 82.3 percent of our total assets. We account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 and for our long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360.\nWe follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies, among other things, non-amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment, either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually. We complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter, based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets (using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance), supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable.\nWhile we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future (as further described in Risk Factors\u201d), our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at, and trends leading up to, the time the estimates and assumptions are made. Different conditions or assumptions, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with our fiscal 2015 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above. We believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were\nappropriate, relevant, and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes. Our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units.\nIn addition, our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities. In these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee, which adds an additional element of risk that could harm our operating results or financial condition. The carrying value of our equity investment was $103.2 million at November 30, 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses not deductible on our tax return. However, some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense, and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities, which could also adversely impact our cash flow.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50.0 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.\nContingent Liabilities. Our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. In the ordinary course of business, we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our Company. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable. Legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nEquity and Other Investments\nHollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway\nKansas Entertainment, a 50/50 joint venture of Penn, a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Kansas Speedway Development Corporation ( KSDC\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC, operates the Hollywood-themed casino and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas Speedway. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operations of the casino.\nWe have accounted for Kansas Entertainment as an equity investment in our financial statements as of November 30, 2015. Our 50.0 percent portion of Kansas Entertainment's net income was approximately $9.4 million, $8.9 million and $14.1 million for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and is included in equity in net income from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations. Included in our fiscal 2013 income from equity investment amount is approximately $1.1 million related to a one-time property tax refund.\nDistributions from Kansas Entertainment, for the year ended November 30, 2015, totaling $32.1 million, consist of $15.2 million received as a distribution from its profits included in net cash provided by operating activities on our statement of cash flows; the remaining $16.8 million received was recognized as a return of capital from investing activities on our statement of cash flows. We received total distributions of approximately $22.0 million in fiscal 2014.\nStaten Island Property\nOn August 5, 2013, we announced that we sold our 676 acre parcel of property located in Staten Island, New York, to Staten Island Marine Development, LLC ( Marine Development\u201d). Marine Development purchased 100 percent of the outstanding equity membership interests of 380 Development LLC ( 380 Development\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC and\nowner of the Staten Island property, for a total sales price of $80.0 million. In addition, we previously received approximately $4.2 million for an option provided to the purchaser that is nonrefundable and does not apply to the $80.0 million sales price.\nWe received $7.5 million, less closing and other administrative costs, of the sales price at closing. The remaining sales price was financed with us holding a secured mortgage interest in 380 Development as well as the underlying property. The mortgage balance bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0 percent. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have received a principal payment of approximately $6.1 million plus interest on the mortgage balance through November 30, 2015, and we will receive the remaining purchase price of $66.4 million, due March 4, 2016. Interest on the remaining mortgage balance is due quarterly, in arrears, and Marine Development is current with all payments through January 2016. Based on the level of Marine Development's initial investment at closing and continuing investment, we have accounted for the transaction using the cost recovery method and have deferred the recognition of profit of approximately $1.9 million, and interest totaling approximately $10.2 million at November 30, 2015, until the carrying amount of the property is recovered, which will not be until the final payment is made.\nThe net proceeds from the sale, combined with the mortgage interest and related total cash tax benefit, will provide us with approximately $118.0 million in incremental cash flow through the term of the mortgage.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain state settlements are the principal cause of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013. The principal causes of the decreased income tax rate for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 are the tax treatment related to the other income recognized as a result of SMI's abandonment of their interest in SMISC, LLC on January 31, 2014, including the related tax benefits associated with various operating loss and other carryforwards of MA and certain tax filing positions of SMISC, LLC totaling approximately $4.0 million along with certain state income tax adjustments. The principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 are reductions in certain state tax rates.\nAs a result of the above items, our effective income tax rate decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately 38.0 percent, 33.0 percent and 37.7 percent for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nAlso of note, while not impacting the combined current and deferred income tax expense and related income tax rate during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014, as compared to the prior fiscal year, the tax benefit realized in fiscal 2013 attributable to the aforementioned sale of our Staten Island property, as well as the effect of the December 2013 expiration of certain tax legislation impacting depreciation deductions contributed substantially to increased current income taxes paid during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 totaling approximately $51.3 million as compared to approximately $18.1 million during fiscal 2013.\nIn December 2014, Congress passed the Tax Increase Prevention Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2014 and continuing through December 2014, of the previously expired tax legislation. The overall impact to the current fiscal year tax depreciation deduction as a result of the expiration of this legislation at December 2014, substantially contributed to the overall reduction of approximately $18.0 million in our long-term deferred income tax liabilities at November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014. In December 2015, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2015 of the previously expired tax legislation. The impact of this retroactive tax legislation will not affect our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate, but will reduce related income tax payments.\nFuture Trends in Operating Results\nInternational Speedway Corporation is the leading owner of major motorsports entertainment facilities and promoter of motorsports-themed entertainment activities in the United States. We compete for discretionary spending and leisure time with many other entertainment alternatives and are subject to factors that generally affect the recreation, leisure and sports industry, including general economic conditions. Our operations are also sensitive to factors that affect corporate budgets. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, employment and wage levels, business conditions, interest and taxation rates, relative commodity prices, and changes in consumer tastes and spending habits.\nThe unprecedented adverse economic conditions that began in 2008, which significantly impacted consumer confidence and disproportionately affected different demographics of our target customers, continue to influence the frequency with which guests attend our major motorsports entertainment events. Ongoing global and regional uncertainty, lack of a broad based middle class economic recovery, and/or further weakening in the domestic economy may continue to adversely impact attendance levels, guest spending levels, and our ability to secure corporate marketing partnerships in the future. Reductions in any of these categories can directly and negatively affect revenues and profitability. Beginning in 2009 we mitigated the decline of certain revenue categories with sustainable cost containment initiatives. Beginning in 2012, we re-instituted regular merit pay increases to more normalized levels. Certain non-controllable costs, such as NASCAR sanction fees, increased this year and recently executed five-year Sanction Agreements covering 2016 to 2020 include annual, contracted growth in fees (see\nfurther detail in Sanctioning Bodies section). While we are sustaining the significant cost reductions previously implemented and continuously seek ways to improve our operating efficiency, we do not expect further significant cost reductions.\nLooking ahead, we expect the continuing slow, but uneven, recovery in the broader U.S. economy to provide an environment for improved attendance-related and corporate partnership revenues. Our industry will further benefit from NASCAR securing its broadcast rights through the 2024 season with the largest broadcast rights deal in the sport's 66-year history. Consistent with major sports properties throughout the world, broadcast rights represent our company's largest revenue segment. Expanding and extending this contracted revenue will provide us unparalleled long-term cash flow visibility. We also believe the strategic initiatives we and the motorsports industry have undertaken to grow the sport will continue to strengthen the long-term health of our Company.\nThe industry and its stakeholders have demonstrated their commitment to growing the sport by aligning with and executing upon growth initiatives supporting NASCAR's industry-wide strategic plan whose objective is to build upon NASCAR's appeal by enhancing the connection with existing fans, as well as attracting and engaging new Gen Y, youth and multicultural consumers in motorsports. Additional areas of focus include building greater product relevance, cultivating driver star power, growing social media activities and enhancing the event experience.\nSeveral recent and successful on-track innovations that resulted from NASCAR initiatives include the introduction of the Gen 6 Car design, new qualifying formats and enhancements to the Chase for the Championship. In January 2014 NASCAR announced a new championship format that puts greater emphasis on winning races all season long, expands the current Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup field to 16 drivers, and implements a new round-by-round advancement format that ultimately rewards a battle-tested, worthy champion. The format makes every race matter even more, diminishes points racing, puts a premium on winning races and concludes with a best-of-the-best, first-to-the-finish line showdown race - all of which is exactly what fans want. The new Chase structure has driven NASCAR Sprint Cup competition to a whole new level with a thrilling, easy to understand format that we believe translates into greater fan interest and revenue opportunities for these events. Our results from the 2015 Chase support this. At this year's Chase finale at Homestead, consumer and corporate participation exceeded 2014 making this the second year in a row this event's results surpassed the prior year. The final two ISC events of the 2015 season in Phoenix and Homestead were both announced as sellouts prior to the event. In addition, for the combined 2015 Chase events ISC hosted, we experienced an overall four percent increase in grandstand attendance over prior year. These are strong indicators that the Chase format along with other strategic initiatives we have implemented are creating favorable momentum that we expect to continue.\nWe support NASCAR's industry strategy on a number of fronts. As referenced above, we are committed to improving our major motorsports facilities to enhance guest experiences and create stronger fan engagement. Specifically, one of the most ambitious and important projects in our history is the redevelopment of the frontstretch of the Daytona International Speedway, the Company's 56-year-old flagship motorsports facility. This new, state of the art motorsports stadium will enhance the event experience for our fans, marketing partners, broadcasters and the motorsports industry (See \"DAYTONA Rising: Reimagining an American Icon\"). We are confident that elevating the experience at the most important and iconic motorsports facility in North America will grow the DAYTONA 500 brand, our 12 other major motorsports facilities' brands and NASCAR's brand. Ultimately this strategic project will positively influence attendance trends, corporate involvement in the sport, and the long-term strength of future broadcast media rights revenues.\nAdmissions\nDriving event sellouts and creating excess demand is key to the optimal performance of our hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events. An important component of our operating strategy continues to be a long-standing focus on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities. By effectively managing both ticket prices and seating capacity, we have historically shown the ability to stimulate ticket renewals and advance ticket sales.\nAdvance ticket sales provide us many benefits such as earlier cash inflow, and reducing the potential negative impact of actual or forecasted inclement weather. When evaluating ticketing initiatives, we first examine our ticket pricing structure for each segmented seating area and/or offering within our major motorsports entertainment facilities to ensure prices are on target with market demand. When determined necessary, we adjust ticket pricing. We believe our ticket pricing philosophy appropriately factors current demand, and provides attractive price points for all income levels and desired fan experiences.\nIt is important that we maintain the integrity of our ticket pricing model by ensuring our customers who purchase tickets during the renewal period get preferential pricing. We do not adjust pricing downward inside of the sales cycle to avoid rewarding last-minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets. Further, we closely monitor and manage the availability of promotional tickets. Encouraging late cycle buying and offering excess promotional tickets could have a detrimental effect on our ticket pricing model and long-term value of our business. We believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long-term growth rather than to capture short-term incremental revenue at the expense of our customers who purchased tickets during the renewal period. We continue to explore and implement innovative ticket pricing\nstrategies to capture incremental admissions revenue including ticket price increases over time as the event nears and adjusting pricing of specific seats within a section or row with desirable attributes and greater demand.\nAdjusting seating capacity is another consumer-focused strategy to promote sellouts, create excess demand and in turn increase capacity utilization at our major motorsports facilities. Over the past few years, we have reduced capacity at our major motorsports facilities. A significant portion of the capacity reduction was a result of our goal to provide improved fan amenities such as wider seating, create social zones with greater fan interaction/engagement for our guests, and remove sections that do not provide adequate sight lines. Based on our experience and the continual evolution of modern sports facilities, ticket demand relies strongly on creating a more personal experience for the fans. Enhancing the live event experience to compete with the at-home television experience is a critical strategy for our future growth. Other benefits derived from capacity management include improved pricing power for our events; enticing more customers to renew or purchase tickets earlier in the sales cycle; increasing customer retention; driving greater attendance to our lead-in events, such as NASCAR's Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events; generating stronger interest from corporate sponsors; and creating a more visually compelling event for the television audience.\nOther key strategic focus areas designed to build fan engagement and augment the live-event experience include providing enhanced at-track audio and visual experiences, additional and improved concession and merchandise points-of-sale, creating more interactive social zones and offering greater wireless connectivity. We continuously monitor market demand, evaluate customer feedback, and explore next generation live-sports entertainment fan amenities, all of which could further impact how we manage capacity and spend capital at our major motorsports facilities.\nCorporate Partnerships\nNASCAR is a powerful brand with a loyal fan base that we believe is aware of, appreciates and supports corporate participation to a greater extent than fans of any other sports property. The combination of brand power and fan loyalty provides an attractive platform for robust corporate partnerships. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies invested in NASCAR remains higher than any other sport. More than one-in-four FORTUNE 500 companies, and one-in-two FORTUNE 100 companies, use NASCAR as part of their marketing strategy and the trend is increasing. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies investing in NASCAR increased seven percent in 2015 versus prior year; and is a 20 percent improvement versus 2008.\nWe believe that our presence in key metropolitan statistical areas, year-round event schedule, impressive portfolio of major motorsports events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing corporate marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships. Companies are demanding more quantifiable return on investment from their sports marketing strategies and our company is focused on delivering enhanced value through our strategic initiatives. This includes enhanced facilities, more frequent and diverse content at our facilities, and deeper understanding of and integration with our customers' business, among other things.\nFor fiscal 2015, total actual ISC corporate sales exceeded our 2015 target by 2.8 percent and surpassed prior year by 3.1 percent making this the second successive year of growing corporate revenues since the Great Recession. All NASCAR Sprint Cup and Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event entitlements were secured for the 2015 fiscal year, which allowed the sales team to focus more resources on media advertising, prospecting and growing official status categories. We believe this demonstrates the value proposition for our corporate partners is stronger than ever.\nLooking", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. We derive revenues primarily from (i) admissions to motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities held at our facilities, (ii) revenue generated in conjunction with or as a result of motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities conducted at our facilities, and (iii) catering, concession and merchandising services during or as a result of these events and amusement activities.\nAdmissions, net\u201d revenue includes ticket sales for all of our racing events and other motorsports activities and amusements, net of any applicable taxes.\nMotorsports and other event related\u201d revenue primarily includes television and ancillary media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping revenues, track rental fees and fees paid by third party promoters for management of non-motorsports events.\nFood, beverage and merchandise\u201d revenue includes revenues from concession stands, direct sales of souvenirs, hospitality catering, programs and other merchandise and fees paid by third party vendors for the right to occupy space to sell souvenirs and concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities.\nDirect expenses include (i) NASCAR event management fees, (ii) motorsports and other event related expenses, which include labor, advertising, costs of competition paid to sanctioning bodies other than NASCAR and other expenses associated with the promotion of all of our motorsports and other events and activities, and (iii) food, beverage and merchandise expenses, consisting primarily of labor and costs of goods sold.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made, actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. We continually review our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements.\nThe following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation. We consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses. Our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party, if any, has the power and benefits. Therefore, we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we, or another party, have the power to direct these activities.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest, board representation and policy making decisions. We periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. We eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results.\nRevenue Recognition. Advance ticket sales and event-related revenues for future events are deferred until earned, which is generally once the events are conducted. The recognition of event-related expenses is matched with the recognition of event-related revenues.\nNASCAR contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series schedules. Event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event. Under the terms of this arrangement, NASCAR retains 10.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event as a component of its sanction fees. The promoter records 90.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records 25.0 percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors. Ultimately, the promoter retains 65.0 percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event.\nOur revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts, with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time. Some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and/or events and include multiple specified elements, such as tickets, hospitality chalets, suites, display space and signage for each included event. The allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements, events and facilities is based on relative selling price. The sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted.\nRevenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers, internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale.\nBusiness Combinations. All business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Whether net assets or common stock is acquired, fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract-based intangible asset associated with long-term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies, such as NASCAR and IMSA series. The continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year. While individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year, a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore, in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations,\u201d are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill.\nCapitalization and Depreciation Policies. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize costs of the project, including, but not limited to, certain pre-acquisition costs, permitting costs, fees paid to architects and contractors, certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary, property taxes and interest.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also is a matter of judgment. Our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets, industry, legal and regulatory factors, and our expectations of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nInterest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project. We capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin, and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period.\nImpairments / Losses on Retirements of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which could be subject to impairments / losses on retirements. During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 we recorded before-tax charges as losses on retirements of long-lived assets primarily attributable to costs to remove certain other long-lived assets located at our motorsports facilities totaling approximately $16.6 million, $10.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively.\nAs of November 30, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment account for approximately $1.7 billion, or 82.3 percent of our total assets. We account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 and for our long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360.\nWe follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies, among other things, non-amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment, either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually. We complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter, based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets (using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance), supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable.\nWhile we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future (as further described in Risk Factors\u201d), our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at, and trends leading up to, the time the estimates and assumptions are made. Different conditions or assumptions, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with our fiscal 2015 assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above. We believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were\nappropriate, relevant, and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes. Our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units.\nIn addition, our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities. In these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee, which adds an additional element of risk that could harm our operating results or financial condition. The carrying value of our equity investment was $103.2 million at November 30, 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses not deductible on our tax return. However, some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense, and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities, which could also adversely impact our cash flow.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50.0 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.\nContingent Liabilities. Our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. In the ordinary course of business, we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our Company. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable. Legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nEquity and Other Investments\nHollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway\nKansas Entertainment, a 50/50 joint venture of Penn, a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Kansas Speedway Development Corporation ( KSDC\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC, operates the Hollywood-themed casino and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas Speedway. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operations of the casino.\nWe have accounted for Kansas Entertainment as an equity investment in our financial statements as of November 30, 2015. Our 50.0 percent portion of Kansas Entertainment's net income was approximately $9.4 million, $8.9 million and $14.1 million for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and is included in equity in net income from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations. Included in our fiscal 2013 income from equity investment amount is approximately $1.1 million related to a one-time property tax refund.\nDistributions from Kansas Entertainment, for the year ended November 30, 2015, totaling $32.1 million, consist of $15.2 million received as a distribution from its profits included in net cash provided by operating activities on our statement of cash flows; the remaining $16.8 million received was recognized as a return of capital from investing activities on our statement of cash flows. We received total distributions of approximately $22.0 million in fiscal 2014.\nStaten Island Property\nOn August 5, 2013, we announced that we sold our 676 acre parcel of property located in Staten Island, New York, to Staten Island Marine Development, LLC ( Marine Development\u201d). Marine Development purchased 100 percent of the outstanding equity membership interests of 380 Development LLC ( 380 Development\u201d), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ISC and\nowner of the Staten Island property, for a total sales price of $80.0 million. In addition, we previously received approximately $4.2 million for an option provided to the purchaser that is nonrefundable and does not apply to the $80.0 million sales price.\nWe received $7.5 million, less closing and other administrative costs, of the sales price at closing. The remaining sales price was financed with us holding a secured mortgage interest in 380 Development as well as the underlying property. The mortgage balance bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0 percent. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have received a principal payment of approximately $6.1 million plus interest on the mortgage balance through November 30, 2015, and we will receive the remaining purchase price of $66.4 million, due March 4, 2016. Interest on the remaining mortgage balance is due quarterly, in arrears, and Marine Development is current with all payments through January 2016. Based on the level of Marine Development's initial investment at closing and continuing investment, we have accounted for the transaction using the cost recovery method and have deferred the recognition of profit of approximately $1.9 million, and interest totaling approximately $10.2 million at November 30, 2015, until the carrying amount of the property is recovered, which will not be until the final payment is made.\nThe net proceeds from the sale, combined with the mortgage interest and related total cash tax benefit, will provide us with approximately $118.0 million in incremental cash flow through the term of the mortgage.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain state settlements are the principal cause of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013. The principal causes of the decreased income tax rate for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 are the tax treatment related to the other income recognized as a result of SMI's abandonment of their interest in SMISC, LLC on January 31, 2014, including the related tax benefits associated with various operating loss and other carryforwards of MA and certain tax filing positions of SMISC, LLC totaling approximately $4.0 million along with certain state income tax adjustments. The principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory income tax rate, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 are reductions in certain state tax rates.\nAs a result of the above items, our effective income tax rate decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately 38.0 percent, 33.0 percent and 37.7 percent for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nAlso of note, while not impacting the combined current and deferred income tax expense and related income tax rate during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014, as compared to the prior fiscal year, the tax benefit realized in fiscal 2013 attributable to the aforementioned sale of our Staten Island property, as well as the effect of the December 2013 expiration of certain tax legislation impacting depreciation deductions contributed substantially to increased current income taxes paid during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 totaling approximately $51.3 million as compared to approximately $18.1 million during fiscal 2013.\nIn December 2014, Congress passed the Tax Increase Prevention Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2014 and continuing through December 2014, of the previously expired tax legislation. The overall impact to the current fiscal year tax depreciation deduction as a result of the expiration of this legislation at December 2014, substantially contributed to the overall reduction of approximately $18.0 million in our long-term deferred income tax liabilities at November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014. In December 2015, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act which included a retroactive renewal back to January 1, 2015 of the previously expired tax legislation. The impact of this retroactive tax legislation will not affect our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate, but will reduce related income tax payments.\nFuture Trends in Operating Results\nInternational Speedway Corporation is the leading owner of major motorsports entertainment facilities and promoter of motorsports-themed entertainment activities in the United States. We compete for discretionary spending and leisure time with many other entertainment alternatives and are subject to factors that generally affect the recreation, leisure and sports industry, including general economic conditions. Our operations are also sensitive to factors that affect corporate budgets. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, employment and wage levels, business conditions, interest and taxation rates, relative commodity prices, and changes in consumer tastes and spending habits.\nThe unprecedented adverse economic conditions that began in 2008, which significantly impacted consumer confidence and disproportionately affected different demographics of our target customers, continue to influence the frequency with which guests attend our major motorsports entertainment events. Ongoing global and regional uncertainty, lack of a broad based middle class economic recovery, and/or further weakening in the domestic economy may continue to adversely impact attendance levels, guest spending levels, and our ability to secure corporate marketing partnerships in the future. Reductions in any of these categories can directly and negatively affect revenues and profitability. Beginning in 2009 we mitigated the decline of certain revenue categories with sustainable cost containment initiatives. Beginning in 2012, we re-instituted regular merit pay increases to more normalized levels. Certain non-controllable costs, such as NASCAR sanction fees, increased this year and recently executed five-year Sanction Agreements covering 2016 to 2020 include annual, contracted growth in fees (see\nfurther detail in Sanctioning Bodies section). While we are sustaining the significant cost reductions previously implemented and continuously seek ways to improve our operating efficiency, we do not expect further significant cost reductions.\nLooking ahead, we expect the continuing slow, but uneven, recovery in the broader U.S. economy to provide an environment for improved attendance-related and corporate partnership revenues. Our industry will further benefit from NASCAR securing its broadcast rights through the 2024 season with the largest broadcast rights deal in the sport's 66-year history. Consistent with major sports properties throughout the world, broadcast rights represent our company's largest revenue segment. Expanding and extending this contracted revenue will provide us unparalleled long-term cash flow visibility. We also believe the strategic initiatives we and the motorsports industry have undertaken to grow the sport will continue to strengthen the long-term health of our Company.\nThe industry and its stakeholders have demonstrated their commitment to growing the sport by aligning with and executing upon growth initiatives supporting NASCAR's industry-wide strategic plan whose objective is to build upon NASCAR's appeal by enhancing the connection with existing fans, as well as attracting and engaging new Gen Y, youth and multicultural consumers in motorsports. Additional areas of focus include building greater product relevance, cultivating driver star power, growing social media activities and enhancing the event experience.\nSeveral recent and successful on-track innovations that resulted from NASCAR initiatives include the introduction of the Gen 6 Car design, new qualifying formats and enhancements to the Chase for the Championship. In January 2014 NASCAR announced a new championship format that puts greater emphasis on winning races all season long, expands the current Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup field to 16 drivers, and implements a new round-by-round advancement format that ultimately rewards a battle-tested, worthy champion. The format makes every race matter even more, diminishes points racing, puts a premium on winning races and concludes with a best-of-the-best, first-to-the-finish line showdown race - all of which is exactly what fans want. The new Chase structure has driven NASCAR Sprint Cup competition to a whole new level with a thrilling, easy to understand format that we believe translates into greater fan interest and revenue opportunities for these events. Our results from the 2015 Chase support this. At this year's Chase finale at Homestead, consumer and corporate participation exceeded 2014 making this the second year in a row this event's results surpassed the prior year. The final two ISC events of the 2015 season in Phoenix and Homestead were both announced as sellouts prior to the event. In addition, for the combined 2015 Chase events ISC hosted, we experienced an overall four percent increase in grandstand attendance over prior year. These are strong indicators that the Chase format along with other strategic initiatives we have implemented are creating favorable momentum that we expect to continue.\nWe support NASCAR's industry strategy on a number of fronts. As referenced above, we are committed to improving our major motorsports facilities to enhance guest experiences and create stronger fan engagement. Specifically, one of the most ambitious and important projects in our history is the redevelopment of the frontstretch of the Daytona International Speedway, the Company's 56-year-old flagship motorsports facility. This new, state of the art motorsports stadium will enhance the event experience for our fans, marketing partners, broadcasters and the motorsports industry (See \"DAYTONA Rising: Reimagining an American Icon\"). We are confident that elevating the experience at the most important and iconic motorsports facility in North America will grow the DAYTONA 500 brand, our 12 other major motorsports facilities' brands and NASCAR's brand. Ultimately this strategic project will positively influence attendance trends, corporate involvement in the sport, and the long-term strength of future broadcast media rights revenues.\nAdmissions\nDriving event sellouts and creating excess demand is key to the optimal performance of our hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events. An important component of our operating strategy continues to be a long-standing focus on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities. By effectively managing both ticket prices and seating capacity, we have historically shown the ability to stimulate ticket renewals and advance ticket sales.\nAdvance ticket sales provide us many benefits such as earlier cash inflow, and reducing the potential negative impact of actual or forecasted inclement weather. When evaluating ticketing initiatives, we first examine our ticket pricing structure for each segmented seating area and/or offering within our major motorsports entertainment facilities to ensure prices are on target with market demand. When determined necessary, we adjust ticket pricing. We believe our ticket pricing philosophy appropriately factors current demand, and provides attractive price points for all income levels and desired fan experiences.\nIt is important that we maintain the integrity of our ticket pricing model by ensuring our customers who purchase tickets during the renewal period get preferential pricing. We do not adjust pricing downward inside of the sales cycle to avoid rewarding last-minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets. Further, we closely monitor and manage the availability of promotional tickets. Encouraging late cycle buying and offering excess promotional tickets could have a detrimental effect on our ticket pricing model and long-term value of our business. We believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long-term growth rather than to capture short-term incremental revenue at the expense of our customers who purchased tickets during the renewal period. We continue to explore and implement innovative ticket pricing\nstrategies to capture incremental admissions revenue including ticket price increases over time as the event nears and adjusting pricing of specific seats within a section or row with desirable attributes and greater demand.\nAdjusting seating capacity is another consumer-focused strategy to promote sellouts, create excess demand and in turn increase capacity utilization at our major motorsports facilities. Over the past few years, we have reduced capacity at our major motorsports facilities. A significant portion of the capacity reduction was a result of our goal to provide improved fan amenities such as wider seating, create social zones with greater fan interaction/engagement for our guests, and remove sections that do not provide adequate sight lines. Based on our experience and the continual evolution of modern sports facilities, ticket demand relies strongly on creating a more personal experience for the fans. Enhancing the live event experience to compete with the at-home television experience is a critical strategy for our future growth. Other benefits derived from capacity management include improved pricing power for our events; enticing more customers to renew or purchase tickets earlier in the sales cycle; increasing customer retention; driving greater attendance to our lead-in events, such as NASCAR's Xfinity and Camping World Truck series events; generating stronger interest from corporate sponsors; and creating a more visually compelling event for the television audience.\nOther key strategic focus areas designed to build fan engagement and augment the live-event experience include providing enhanced at-track audio and visual experiences, additional and improved concession and merchandise points-of-sale, creating more interactive social zones and offering greater wireless connectivity. We continuously monitor market demand, evaluate customer feedback, and explore next generation live-sports entertainment fan amenities, all of which could further impact how we manage capacity and spend capital at our major motorsports facilities.\nCorporate Partnerships\nNASCAR is a powerful brand with a loyal fan base that we believe is aware of, appreciates and supports corporate participation to a greater extent than fans of any other sports property. The combination of brand power and fan loyalty provides an attractive platform for robust corporate partnerships. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies invested in NASCAR remains higher than any other sport. More than one-in-four FORTUNE 500 companies, and one-in-two FORTUNE 100 companies, use NASCAR as part of their marketing strategy and the trend is increasing. The number of FORTUNE 500 companies investing in NASCAR increased seven percent in 2015 versus prior year; and is a 20 percent improvement versus 2008.\nWe believe that our presence in key metropolitan statistical areas, year-round event schedule, impressive portfolio of major motorsports events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing corporate marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships. Companies are demanding more quantifiable return on investment from their sports marketing strategies and our company is focused on delivering enhanced value through our strategic initiatives. This includes enhanced facilities, more frequent and diverse content at our facilities, and deeper understanding of and integration with our customers' business, among other things.\nFor fiscal 2015, total actual ISC corporate sales exceeded our 2015 target by 2.8 percent and surpassed prior year by 3.1 percent making this the second successive year of growing corporate revenues since the Great Recession. All NASCAR Sprint Cup and Xfinity and Camping World Truck series event entitlements were secured for the 2015 fiscal year, which allowed the sales team to focus more resources on media advertising, prospecting and growing official status categories. We believe this demonstrates the value proposition for our corporate partners is stronger than ever.\nLooking"}
