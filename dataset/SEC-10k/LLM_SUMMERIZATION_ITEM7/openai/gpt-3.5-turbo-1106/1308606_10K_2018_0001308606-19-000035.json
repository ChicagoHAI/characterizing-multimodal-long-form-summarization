Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange listed company under the ticker symbol \"SRC.\" We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting and capital markets. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the U.S., which are generally acquired through strategic sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our owned real estate represented investments in 1,462 properties. Our properties are leased to 252 tenants across 49 states and 32 industries. As of December 31, 2018, our owned properties were approximately 99.7% occupied (based on number of economically yielding properties). In addition, our investment in real estate includes commercial mortgage and other loans secured by an additional 52 real estate properties or other related assets.\nOur operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nOn May 31, 2018, we completed a Spin-Off of all of our interests in the assets that collateralize Master Trust 2014, our properties leased to Shopko, and certain other assets into an independent, publicly traded REIT, SMTA. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, our stockholders received a distribution of common shares of beneficial interest in SMTA, which are treated as a taxable distribution to them. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the historical financial results of SMTA are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPurchase Accounting and Acquisition of Real Estate; Lease Intangibles\nWe use a number of sources to estimate fair value of real estate acquisitions, including building age, building location, building condition, rent comparables from similar properties, and terms of in-place leases, if any. Lease intangibles, if any, acquired in conjunction with the purchase of real estate represent the value of in-place leases and above or below-market leases. In-place lease intangibles are valued based on our estimates of costs related to tenant acquisition and the carrying costs that would be incurred during the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases at the time of the acquisition. We then\nallocate the purchase price (including acquisition and closing costs) to land, building, improvements and equipment based on their relative fair values. For properties acquired with in-place leases, we allocate the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. Above and below-market lease intangibles are recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases at the time of acquisition of the real estate and our estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease.\nImpairment\nWe review our real estate investments and related lease intangibles periodically for indicators of impairment, including the asset being held for sale, vacant or non-operating, tenant bankruptcy or delinquency, and leases expiring in 60 days or less. For assets with indicators of impairment, we then evaluate if its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider factors such as expected future undiscounted cash flows, estimated residual value, market trends (such as the effects of leasing demand and competition) and other factors in making this assessment. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows.\nImpairment is then calculated as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, or for assets held for sale, as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value less costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and fair values include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates, interest rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, lease renewal probabilities, tenant vacancy rates and other factors.\nREIT Status\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To maintain our REIT status, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided that we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level federal income tax on the earnings distributed to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities. We are still subject to state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nTable 146:

<td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed.\nRevenues\nRental income\nWhile we were a net acquirer of income producing real estate for the year ended December 31, 2018, our contractual rental revenue between periods decreased 4.9% as a result of the timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. Included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 were acquisitions of 17 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, and dispositions of 29 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million.\nThe decrease in contractual rental revenues year-over-year was partially offset by fewer tenant credit issues from 2017 to 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, five and 11 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.3% and 0.7% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.0% and 3.5% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31,\n2018 and 2017, non-cash rental income was $20.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.0% and 5.9%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nIn conjunction with the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes issuance completed in December 2017, the Operating Partnership, as sponsor of the issuance, retained a 5.0% economic interest in the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, this holding is reflected as Investment in Master Trust 2014 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and the related interest income resulted in an increase in interest income period-over-period. That increase was offset by a decrease in interest income from mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the pay-off of one $7.5 million mortgage loan collateralized by 26 properties.\nRelated party fee income\nIn conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Asset Management Agreement with SMTA pursuant to which we provide a management team that is responsible for implementing SMTA's business strategy and performing certain services for SMTA. Under this agreement, we recognized $11.7 million of revenues during the period from the Spin- Off to December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, we provide property management services and special services for Master Trust 2014, which was contributed to SMTA as part of the Spin-Off. Therefore, during the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized $4.2 million in revenue under the terms of the Property Management and Servicing Agreement.\nIn January 2019, SMTA announced that due to the bankruptcy of its largest tenant, it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early termination of the Asset Management Agreement and/or the Property Management and Servicing Agreement, in which case we would be entitled to a termination fee. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther income\nThe driver for the increase in other income was the receipt of the final settlement of $19.7 million in relation to the Company's claim from 20 properties leased to Haggen at the time of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC's bankruptcy in 2015. As a result of this settlement, $19.1 million of other income was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, we recognized other income of $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for pre-payment penalty income when one of our mortgage loans receivable, which was collateralized by 26 properties, was paid off in 2018 prior to its scheduled maturity.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year decrease is a result of decreases in legal fees, primarily as a result of fewer tenant credit issues and internalization of certain legal items, and of decreases in consulting fees, primarily as a result of certain expenses incurred in 2017 related to re-branding and executive team transition, as well as internalization of certain marketing activities.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $20.4 million (including $15.6 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The non-reimbursable costs decreased year-over-year as a result of fewer vacancies and tenant credit issues, while the decrease in reimbursable property costs resulted from decreases in reimbursable property taxes and certain property maintenance expenses. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.7 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the extinguishment of $195.8 million principal outstanding of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt during the year ended December 31, 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense for the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2018 as the facility was not utilized for the first half of 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Term Loan\n</td> <td>6,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - mortgages and notes payable\n</td> <td>26,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>13,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount, net\n</td> <td>10,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 17 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, while disposing 29 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million. While we were a net acquirer during the period (based on Real Estate Investment Value), depreciation and amortization decreased period-over-period as a result of timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other depreciation\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of lease intangibles\n</td> <td>28,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $6.7 million. $1.9 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $1.3 million recorded on three Vacant held for use properties and $0.6 million recorded on one Vacant held for sale property. The remaining $4.8 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $4.4 million recorded on 17 underperforming held for use properties and $0.4 million recorded on two underperforming held for sale properties.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $61.6 million. $45.7 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $34.5 million recorded on 16 Vacant held for use properties and $11.2 million recorded on 11 Vacant held for sale properties. The remaining $15.9 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $14.6 million recorded on 12 underperforming held for use properties and $1.3 million recorded on five underperforming held for sale properties.\nGain on debt extinguishment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished $195.8 million of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $27.1 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the extinguishment of $56.2 million of CMBS debt related to six defaulted loans on six underperforming properties, which was partially offset by a loss on the extinguishment of the Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-1 notes and make-whole penalties on early pre-payments of Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-2.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we extinguished $195.4 million of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.6 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the partial extinguishment of one defaulted mortgage loan upon the sale of one of the properties collateralizing the loan to a third party, offset by net losses from the prepayment and defeasance fees on mortgage debt related to 25 properties.\nGain on disposition of assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we disposed of 29 properties and recorded gains totaling $14.6 million. There were $15.5 million in net gains on the sale of 19 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of four Vacant properties and $0.2 million in net other losses. There were no gains/losses recorded on the transfer of six properties to lenders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 116 properties and recorded net gains totaling $42.7 million. There were $49.7 million in net gains on the sale of 55 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $6.7 million in net losses on the sale of 61 Vacant properties and $0.3 million in net other losses.\nPreferred dividend income from SMTA\nAs part of the Spin-Off of SMTA, SMTA issued to us 10% Series A preferred shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of $150.0 million. During the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized preferred dividend income of $8.8 million from these shares. As noted above, in January 2019, SMTA announced it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early repayment of the Series A preferred shares or other outcomes. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther expense\nWe are contingently liable for $5.7 million of debt owed by one of our former tenants. As a result of the former tenant filing for bankruptcy, we recognized $5.3 million of debt guarantee expense in the current period to fully reserve for the contingent liability.\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations\nSubsequent to the completion of the Spin-Off of SMTA on May 31, 2018, the only activity recognized in discontinued operations were transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off. Therefore, the year ended December 31, 2018 only reflects five months of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off. This resulted in a decrease in (loss) income from discontinued operations compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflects a full year of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

periods increased by 0.9% as we were a moderate acquirer of income producing real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017. We acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, included in continuing operations, during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was offset by the sale of 116 properties during the same period with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million, of which 58 were income producing properties with a real estate investment value of $254.3 million. This increase in contractual rental revenues was partially offset by tenant credit losses in the first quarter of 2017, where the majority of the non-performing properties were in the convenience store and movie theater industries. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 11 and 28 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.7% and 1.8% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.5% and 2.8% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-cash rental income was $25.0 million and $26.4 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nWhile financed properties increased from 69 at December 31, 2016 to 83 at December 31, 2017, resulting in an increase of 28.9% in the related mortgage loans receivable balances for the comparative period, interest income on loans receivable remained flat as all the newly financed mortgage loans in 2017 were originated in the last four months of the year.\nOther income\nThe year-over-year decrease in other income is primarily due to $5.5 million in fee income associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2016, and no comparable transaction for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, lease termination fees collected for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.1 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to $11.1 million in severance related costs, comprised of $4.2 million of cash compensation and $6.9 million of non-cash compensation, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 following the departure of our chief executive officer. The period-over-period increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in compensation expenses excluding the severance charges, the $1.7 million loss recognized in the comparable prior period related to termination fees on an interest rate swap, and a $1.0 million decrease in professional and other outside services expenses.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $24.1 million (including $14.7 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The non-reimbursable costs remained relatively flat year-over-year, while reimbursable property costs increased by $2.1 million, driven by an increase in reimbursable property taxes. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.5 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the extinguishment of $195.4 million of mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase in interest due to increased average borrowings year-over-year under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, as well as interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings from continuing operations:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Term Loan\n</td> <td>9,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - mortgages and notes payable\n</td> <td>40,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>13,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses related to interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount/(premium), net\n</td> <td>8,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, while we sold 116 properties with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million. However, of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 44 properties with a real estate investment value of $130.2 million that were classified as held for sale. As properties held for sale are no longer depreciated, we were a net acquirer of depreciable property. Further, fewer properties were classified as held for sale in 2017 than in 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was partially offset by impairment charges recorded in 2017 on properties that remain in our portfolio. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other depreciation\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of lease intangibles\n</td> <td>32,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $61.6 million. $45.7 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $34.5 million recorded on 16 Vacant held for use properties and $11.2 million recorded on 11 Vacant held for sale properties. The remaining $15.9 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $14.6 million recorded on 12 underperforming held for use properties and $1.3 million recorded on five underperforming held for sale properties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment losses of $61.4 million. $32.6 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $24.1 million recorded on 15 Vacant held for use properties and $8.5 million recorded on five Vacant held for sale properties. The remaining $28.8 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $23.3 million recorded on 23 underperforming held for use properties and $5.5 million recorded on nine underperforming held for sale properties.\nGain on debt extinguishment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we extinguished $195.4 million of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.6 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the partial extinguishment of one defaulted mortgage loan upon sale of one of the properties collateralizing the loan to a third party, offset by net losses from the prepayment and defeasance fees on mortgage debt related to 25 properties. During the same period in 2016, we extinguished $763.7 million of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $1.6 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the extinguishment of three defaulted mortgage loans and the partial extinguishment of one defaulted mortgage loan upon sale of the properties collateralizing these loans to third parties, offset by net losses from the prepayment and defeasance fees on mortgage debt related to 343 properties.\nGain on disposition of assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 116 properties and recorded net gains totaling $42.7 million. There were $49.7 million in net gains on the sale of 55 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $6.7 million in net losses on the sale of 61 Vacant properties and $0.3 million in net other losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we disposed of 165 properties and recorded net gains totaling $29.6 million. There were $29.4 million in net gains on the sale of 151 active properties and $0.6 million in net gains on the transfer of seven properties to lenders. These gains were partially offset by $0.3 million in net losses on the sale of seven Vacant properties and $0.1 million in net other losses.\nIncome from discontinued operations\nThe decrease in income from discontinued operations is a result of a decrease in revenues year-over-year of $12.9 million, an increase in expenses of $18.2 million, and a decrease in other income of $1.2 million.\nThe primary driver of the decrease in revenues was a 4.0% decrease in contractual rental revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, only one property was acquired within discontinued operations with a real estate investment value of $10.1 million, while 76 properties with a real estate investment value of $154.3 million were disposed. Of the disposals, 32 were income producing with a real estate investment value of $113.1 million. This net disposition activity resulted in the decrease in contractual rental revenue. Additionally, the mortgage loans secured by 66 properties were paid off in mid-2016, also reducing revenue year-over-year.\nThe increase in expenses was driven by an increase in recognized impairments of $13.9 million. Additionally, all $6.4 million of transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off incurred in 2017 were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP. The decrease in other income was the result of a $0.9 million increase in losses on debt extinguishment, primarily related to the $1.6 million pre-payment premium paid in conjunction with our voluntary pre-payment of the full outstanding balance of Master Trust 2014 Series 2014-1 Class A1 note of $43.1 million in November 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn May 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. These purchases can be made in the open market or through private transactions from time to time over the 18-month time period following authorization. Purchase activity will be dependent on various factors, including our capital position, operating results, funds generated by asset sales, dividends that may be required by those sales, and investment options that may be available, including acquiring new properties or retiring debt. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We intend to fund any repurchases with new proceeds from asset sales, cash flows from operations, existing cash on the balance sheet and other sources, including debt. As of December 31, 2018, no shares have been repurchased under this new program.\nIn August 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. These purchases can be made in the open market or through private transactions from time to time over the 18-month time period following authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2018, and prior to the SMTA Spin-Off, 4.2 million shares of our common stock were repurchased in open market transactions under the stock repurchase program at a weighted average price of $39.60 per share. Fees associated with these repurchases of $0.5 million are included in accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheets. Since the authorization of the August 2017 stock repurchase program, 6.1 million shares of our common stock were repurchased in open market transactions, at a weighted average price of $40.70 per share, and no additional capacity remains under this stock repurchase program. Total fees associated with repurchases under the August 2017 stock repurchase program were $733.1 thousand.\nATM Program\nIn November 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new $500.0 million ATM Program. Since its inception through December 31, 2018, the Corporation sold 92.5 thousand shares of its common stock, at a weighted average share price of $40.57, for aggregate gross proceeds of $3.8 million.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for operating expenses, acquisitions, distributions to stockholders and payment of interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to fund these demands primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facility, A-1 Term Loan and A-2 Term Loan (which replaced the 2015 Credit Facility and 2015 Term Loan in their entirety in January 2019). As of December 31, 2018, available liquidity was comprised of $653.7 million of borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility, $62.9 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents, and $14.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe plan to meet our long-term capital needs, including long-term financing of property acquisitions, by issuing registered debt or equity securities, obtaining asset level financing and by issuing fixed-rate secured or unsecured notes and bonds. In the future, some of our property acquisitions could be made by issuing partnership interests of our Operating Partnership in exchange for property owned by third parties. These partnership interests would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.\nWe continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, we cannot be sure that we will have access to the capital markets at times and on terms that are acceptable to us. We expect that our primary uses of capital will be for property and other asset acquisitions, the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, debt service payments, and distributions to our stockholders.\nDescription of Certain Debt\nThe following descriptions of debt should be read in conjunction with Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements herein.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, the aggregate gross commitment under the 2015 Credit Facility was $800.0 million, which may be increased up to $1.0 billion by exercising an accordion feature, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. The 2015 Credit Agreement also included a $50.0 million sub-limit for swing-line loans and up to $60.0 million available for issuance of letters of credit. Swing-line loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The 2015 Credit Agreement had an initial maturity of March 31, 2019.\nPayment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and, under certain circumstances, by one or more material subsidiaries (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the 2015 Credit Facility bore interest at 1-Month LIBOR plus 1.25%, with $146.3 million in borrowings outstanding, and incurred a facility fee of 0.25% per annum. Amounts available for borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility remained subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA of the Company, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties, to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum tangible net worth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to these covenants, the 2015 Credit Agreement also included other customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on any national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these covenants.\nOn January 14, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into a new 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders, comprised of the 2019 Credit Facility and the A-1 Term Loans.\nThe outstanding loans under the 2019 Credit Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.10% per annum and the aggregate revolving commitments incur a facility fee of 0.25% per annum, in each case, based on the Operating Partnership's credit rating. The 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $400.0 million of revolving borrowing capacity, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nThe A-1 Term Loans currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum based on the Operating Partnership's credit rating. The 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $200.0 million of term loans, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nTerm Loans\nAs of December 31, 2018, the term loan facility under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement was $420.0 million, which may be increased up to $600.0 million by exercising an accordion feature, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. The 2015 Term Loan Agreement had an initial maturity date of November 2, 2018. In November 2018, we exercised the first of two options to extend the maturity date of the 2015 Term Loan to November 2, 2019.\nPayment of the term loans under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement was unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and, under certain circumstances, by one or more material subsidiaries (as defined in the 2015 Term Loan Agreement) of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, term loans under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement bore interest at 1-Month LIBOR plus 1.35%, with the $420.0 million capacity fully drawn. Amounts available for borrowing under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement remained subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA of the Company, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties, to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness of the Company, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum tangible net worth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the 2015 Term Loan Agreement included other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on a national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents. The ability to borrow under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement was subject to continued compliance with all of the covenants described above. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants.\nOn January 14, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into a new 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders, comprised of the 2019 Credit Facility and the A-1 Term Loans.\nThe 2019 Credit Facility is comprised of $800.0 million of aggregate revolving commitments with a maturity date of March 31, 2023. The outstanding loans under the 2019 Credit Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.10% per annum and the aggregate revolving commitments incur a facility fee of 0.25% per annum, in each case, based on the Operating Partnership's credit rating. The 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $400.0 million of revolving borrowing capacity, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nThe A-1 Term Loans have an aggregate borrowing amount of $420.0 million with a maturity date of March 31, 2024. The A-1 Term Loans currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum based on the Operating Partnership's credit rating. The 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $200.0 million of term loans, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nIn addition, on January 14, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into new A-2 Term Loans with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders, comprised of $400 million of delayed draw term loans with a maturity date of March 31, 2022. The A-2 Term Loans currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum based on the Operating Partnership's credit rating. In addition, a ticking fee accrues on the unused portion of\nthe commitments at a rate of 0.20% until the earlier of July 12, 2019 and the termination of the commitments. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the A-2 Term Loans. The A-2 Term Loans include an accordion feature providing for an additional $200.0 million of term loans, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nThe 2019 Facilities Agreements replaced the existing 2015 Credit Agreement and 2015 Term Loan Agreement.\nMaster Trust 2013\nMaster Trust 2013 is an asset-backed securitization platform through which we raise capital by issuing non-recourse net lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net leases and mortgage loans (the \"Collateral Pool\"). The Collateral Pool is managed by the Company in our capacity as property manager. Rental and mortgage receipts from the Collateral Pool are deposited with the indenture trustee, who first utilizes the funds to satisfy the debt service requirements on the notes and any fees and costs of administration of Mater Trust 2013. The remaining funds are remitted to the issuer on the monthly note payment date.\nUpon satisfaction of certain conditions, we may, from time to time, sell or exchange real estate properties or mortgage loans from the Collateral Pool. Proceeds from these sales are held on deposit by the indenture trustee until a qualifying substitution is made or the amounts are distributed as an early repayment of principal. At December 31, 2018, $7.4 million was held on deposit with the indenture trustee and classified as restricted cash within deferred costs and other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet.\nOn May 21, 2018, we retired the Series 2013-1 Class A notes. There was no make-whole payment associated with the redemption of these notes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were $15.2 million in prepayments on the Series 2013-2 Class A notes, with $934 thousand in associated make-whole payments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by 269 owned and financed properties held in one bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity as issuer, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The outstanding series of Master Trust 2013 notes was rated investment grade as of December 31, 2018.

Each special purpose entity is a bankruptcy remote separate legal entity, and is the sole owner of its assets and solely responsible for its liabilities other than typical non-recurring covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had seven fixed-rate CMBS loans with $274.8 million of aggregate outstanding principal, a weighted average contractual interest rate of 5.53%, and a weighted average maturity of 4.5 years. Approximately 70.7% of this debt is partially amortizing and requires a balloon payment at maturity. These balances include one loan that is in default, discussed further below.

In total, these mortgage notes had outstanding principal of $27.9 million at December 31, 2018, which is included in mortgages and notes payable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018, these mortgage notes have a weighted average stated interest rate of 1.00%, a weighted average remaining term of 9.2 years and are eligible for early repayment without penalty.\nConvertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes are comprised of two series of notes: (i) $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% convertible notes maturing on May 15, 2019 and (ii) $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible notes maturing on May 15, 2021. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes was $729.8 million, net of discounts (primarily consisting of the value of the embedded conversion feature) and unamortized deferred financing costs.\nHolders may convert notes of either series prior to November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, only under specific circumstances: (1) if the closing price of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the Convertible Notes prospectus supplement. On or after November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes of the applicable series at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.\nThe conversion rate for each series of the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment for some events, including dividends paid in excess of threshold amounts stipulated in the agreement, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2018, the conversion rate was 17.4458 per $1,000 principal note. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes supplemental indentures), holders may require\nus to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes of the Operating Partnership have an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million and are guaranteed by the Company. The Senior Unsecured Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.45% per year, payable on March 15 and September 15 with a final maturity date of September 15, 2026.\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at the Operating Partnership's option, at a redemption price equal to the sum of: an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date; and a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemed on or after June 15, 2026, the redemption price will not include a make-whole premium.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Corporation and Operating Partnership remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness, to total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company's other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles) of 0.60:1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum unencumbered asset coverage ratio (defined as total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company's other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles, to consolidated total unsecured indebtedness) of 1.50:1:00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total secured indebtedness, to total consolidated undepreciated real estate assets plus the Company's other assets, excluding accounts receivable and non-real estate intangibles) of 0.40:1.00; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as consolidated income available for debt service, to the annual service charge) of 1.50:1.0.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the Senior Unsecured Notes Agreement includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (i) maintenance of status as a REIT; (ii) payment of all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied on the REIT; (iii) reporting on financial information; and (iv) maintenance of properties and property insurance.

Under the 2017 Tax Legislation, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Distributions in excess of a stockholder's federal income tax basis in our common stock are generally characterized as capital gain.\nWe are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gains) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including capital gains).\nWe intend to make distributions that will enable us to meet the distribution requirements applicable to REITs and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay corporate-level federal income and excise taxes.\nAny distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and their form, timing and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nCASH FLOWS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>336,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(220,462\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(153,189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(470,409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(115,095\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $77.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as compared to $114.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in cash rental income of $142.3 million and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in transaction costs of $16.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> This decrease was offset by:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $9.8 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in other income of $15.2 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash from related party income of $14.2 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash from preferred dividend income of $5.1 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in cash interest expense of $45.5 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in property costs of $12.4 million, primarily due to a reduction in Vacant properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Investing Activities\nCash (used in) provided by investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, for investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, for capital expenditures.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange listed company under the ticker symbol \"SRC.\" We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting and capital markets. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the U.S., which are generally acquired through strategic sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our owned real estate represented investments in 1,462 properties. Our properties are leased to 252 tenants across 49 states and 32 industries. As of December 31, 2018, our owned properties were approximately 99.7% occupied (based on number of economically yielding properties). In addition, our investment in real estate includes commercial mortgage and other loans secured by an additional 52 real estate properties or other related assets.\nOur operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nOn May 31, 2018, we completed a Spin-Off of all of our interests in the assets that collateralize Master Trust 2014, our properties leased to Shopko, and certain other assets into an independent, publicly traded REIT, SMTA. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, our stockholders received a distribution of common shares of beneficial interest in SMTA, which are treated as a taxable distribution to them. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the historical financial results of SMTA are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPurchase Accounting and Acquisition of Real Estate; Lease Intangibles\nWe use a number of sources to estimate fair value of real estate acquisitions, including building age, building location, building condition, rent comparables from similar properties, and terms of in-place leases, if any. Lease intangibles, if any, acquired in conjunction with the purchase of real estate represent the value of in-place leases and above or below-market leases. In-place lease intangibles are valued based on our estimates of costs related to tenant acquisition and the carrying costs that would be incurred during the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases at the time of the acquisition. We then\nallocate the purchase price (including acquisition and closing costs) to land, building, improvements and equipment based on their relative fair values. For properties acquired with in-place leases, we allocate the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. Above and below-market lease intangibles are recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases at the time of acquisition of the real estate and our estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease.\nImpairment\nWe review our real estate investments and related lease intangibles periodically for indicators of impairment, including the asset being held for sale, vacant or non-operating, tenant bankruptcy or delinquency, and leases expiring in 60 days or less. For assets with indicators of impairment, we then evaluate if its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider factors such as expected future undiscounted cash flows, estimated residual value, market trends (such as the effects of leasing demand and competition) and other factors in making this assessment. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows.\nImpairment is then calculated as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, or for assets held for sale, as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value less costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and fair values include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates, interest rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, lease renewal probabilities, tenant vacancy rates and other factors.\nREIT Status\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To maintain our REIT status, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided that we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level federal income tax on the earnings distributed to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities. We are still subject to state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\n\nNM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed.\nRevenues\nRental income\nWhile we were a net acquirer of income producing real estate for the year ended December 31, 2018, our contractual rental revenue between periods decreased 4.9% as a result of the timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. Included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 were acquisitions of 17 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, and dispositions of 29 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million.\nThe decrease in contractual rental revenues year-over-year was partially offset by fewer tenant credit issues from 2017 to 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, five and 11 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.3% and 0.7% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.0% and 3.5% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31,\n2018 and 2017, non-cash rental income was $20.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.0% and 5.9%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nIn conjunction with the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes issuance completed in December 2017, the Operating Partnership, as sponsor of the issuance, retained a 5.0% economic interest in the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, this holding is reflected as Investment in Master Trust 2014 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and the related interest income resulted in an increase in interest income period-over-period. That increase was offset by a decrease in interest income from mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the pay-off of one $7.5 million mortgage loan collateralized by 26 properties.\nRelated party fee income\nIn conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Asset Management Agreement with SMTA pursuant to which we provide a management team that is responsible for implementing SMTA's business strategy and performing certain services for SMTA. Under this agreement, we recognized $11.7 million of revenues during the period from the Spin- Off to December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, we provide property management services and special services for Master Trust 2014, which was contributed to SMTA as part of the Spin-Off. Therefore, during the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized $4.2 million in revenue under the terms of the Property Management and Servicing Agreement.\nIn January 2019, SMTA announced that due to the bankruptcy of its largest tenant, it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early termination of the Asset Management Agreement and/or the Property Management and Servicing Agreement, in which case we would be entitled to a termination fee. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther income\nThe driver for the increase in other income was the receipt of the final settlement of $19.7 million in relation to the Company's claim from 20 properties leased to Haggen at the time of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC's bankruptcy in 2015. As a result of this settlement, $19.1 million of other income was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, we recognized other income of $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for pre-payment penalty income when one of our mortgage loans receivable, which was collateralized by 26 properties, was paid off in 2018 prior to its scheduled maturity.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year decrease is a result of decreases in legal fees, primarily as a result of fewer tenant credit issues and internalization of certain legal items, and of decreases in consulting fees, primarily as a result of certain expenses incurred in 2017 related to re-branding and executive team transition, as well as internalization of certain marketing activities.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $20.4 million (including $15.6 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The non-reimbursable costs decreased year-over-year as a result of fewer vacancies and tenant credit issues, while the decrease in reimbursable property costs resulted from decreases in reimbursable property taxes and certain property maintenance expenses. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.7 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the extinguishment of $195.8 million principal outstanding of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt during the year ended December 31, 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense for the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2018 as the facility was not utilized for the first half of 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings:\n\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 17 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, while disposing 29 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million. While we were a net acquirer during the period (based on Real Estate Investment Value), depreciation and amortization decreased period-over-period as a result of timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense:\n\nImpairment\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $6.7 million. $1.9 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $1.3 million recorded on three Vacant held for use properties and $0.6 million recorded on one Vacant held for sale property. The remaining $4.8 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $4.4 million recorded on 17 underperforming held for use properties and $0.4 million recorded on two underperforming held for sale properties.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $61.6 million. $45.7 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $34.5 million recorded on 16 Vacant held for use properties and $11.2 million recorded on 11 Vacant held for sale properties. The remaining $15.9 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $14.6 million recorded on 12 underperforming held for use properties and $1.3 million recorded on five underperforming held for sale properties.\nGain on debt extinguishment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished $195.8 million of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $27.1 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the extinguishment of $56.2 million of CMBS debt related to six defaulted loans on six underperforming properties, which was partially offset by a loss on the extinguishment of the Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-1 notes and make-whole penalties on early pre-payments of Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-2.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we extinguished $195.4 million of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.6 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the partial extinguishment of one defaulted mortgage loan upon the sale of one of the properties collateralizing the loan to a third party, offset by net losses from the prepayment and defeasance fees on mortgage debt related to 25 properties.\nGain on disposition of assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we disposed of 29 properties and recorded gains totaling $14.6 million. There were $15.5 million in net gains on the sale of 19 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of four Vacant properties and $0.2 million in net other losses. There were no gains/losses recorded on the transfer of six properties to lenders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 116 properties and recorded net gains totaling $42.7 million. There were $49.7 million in net gains on the sale of 55 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $6.7 million in net losses on the sale of 61 Vacant properties and $0.3 million in net other losses.\nPreferred dividend income from SMTA\nAs part of the Spin-Off of SMTA, SMTA issued to us 10% Series A preferred shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of $150.0 million. During the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized preferred dividend income of $8.8 million from these shares. As noted above, in January 2019, SMTA announced it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early repayment of the Series A preferred shares or other outcomes. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther expense\nWe are contingently liable for $5.7 million of debt owed by one of our former tenants. As a result of the former tenant filing for bankruptcy, we recognized $5.3 million of debt guarantee expense in the current period to fully reserve for the contingent liability.\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations\nSubsequent to the completion of the Spin-Off of SMTA on May 31, 2018, the only activity recognized in discontinued operations were transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off. Therefore, the year ended December 31, 2018 only reflects five months of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off. This resulted in a decrease in (loss) income from discontinued operations compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflects a full year of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n\nRevenues\nRental income\nOur contractual rental revenues between periods increased by 0.9% as we were a moderate acquirer of income producing real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017. We acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, included in continuing operations, during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was offset by the sale of 116 properties during the same period with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million, of which 58 were income producing properties with a real estate investment value of $254.3 million. This increase in contractual rental revenues was partially offset by tenant credit losses in the first quarter of 2017, where the majority of the non-performing properties were in the convenience store and movie theater industries. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 11 and 28 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.7% and 1.8% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.5% and 2.8% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-cash rental income was $25.0 million and $26.4 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nWhile financed properties increased from 69 at December 31, 2016 to 83 at December 31, 2017, resulting in an increase of 28.9% in the related mortgage loans receivable balances for the comparative period, interest income on loans receivable remained flat as all the newly financed mortgage loans in 2017 were originated in the last four months of the year.\nOther income\nThe year-over-year decrease in other income is primarily due to $5.5 million in fee income associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2016, and no comparable transaction for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, lease termination fees collected for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.1 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to $11.1 million in severance related costs, comprised of $4.2 million of cash compensation and $6.9 million of non-cash compensation, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 following the departure of our chief executive officer. The period-over-period increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in compensation expenses excluding the severance charges, the $1.7 million loss recognized in the comparable prior period related to termination fees on an interest rate swap, and a $1.0 million decrease in professional and other outside services expenses.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $24.1 million (including $14.7 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The non-reimbursable costs remained relatively flat year-over-year, while reimbursable property costs increased by $2.1 million, driven by an increase in reimbursable property taxes. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.5 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the extinguishment of $195.4 million of mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase in interest due to increased average borrowings year-over-year under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, as well as interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings from continuing operations:\n\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, while we sold 116 properties with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million. However, of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 44 properties with a real estate investment value of $130.2 million that were classified as held for sale. As properties held for sale are no longer depreciated, we were a net acquirer of depreciable property. Further, fewer properties were classified as held for sale in 2017 than in 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nSpirit Realty Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange listed company under the ticker symbol \"SRC.\" We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting and capital markets. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the U.S., which are generally acquired through strategic sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our owned real estate represented investments in 1,462 properties. Our properties are leased to 252 tenants across 49 states and 32 industries. As of December 31, 2018, our owned properties were approximately 99.7% occupied (based on number of economically yielding properties). In addition, our investment in real estate includes commercial mortgage and other loans secured by an additional 52 real estate properties or other related assets.\nOur operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.\nOn May 31, 2018, we completed a Spin-Off of all of our interests in the assets that collateralize Master Trust 2014, our properties leased to Shopko, and certain other assets into an independent, publicly traded REIT, SMTA. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, our stockholders received a distribution of common shares of beneficial interest in SMTA, which are treated as a taxable distribution to them. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the historical financial results of SMTA are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur accounting policies are determined in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. Set forth below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPurchase Accounting and Acquisition of Real Estate; Lease Intangibles\nWe use a number of sources to estimate fair value of real estate acquisitions, including building age, building location, building condition, rent comparables from similar properties, and terms of in-place leases, if any. Lease intangibles, if any, acquired in conjunction with the purchase of real estate represent the value of in-place leases and above or below-market leases. In-place lease intangibles are valued based on our estimates of costs related to tenant acquisition and the carrying costs that would be incurred during the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases at the time of the acquisition. We then\nallocate the purchase price (including acquisition and closing costs) to land, building, improvements and equipment based on their relative fair values. For properties acquired with in-place leases, we allocate the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. Above and below-market lease intangibles are recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases at the time of acquisition of the real estate and our estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease.\nImpairment\nWe review our real estate investments and related lease intangibles periodically for indicators of impairment, including the asset being held for sale, vacant or non-operating, tenant bankruptcy or delinquency, and leases expiring in 60 days or less. For assets with indicators of impairment, we then evaluate if its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider factors such as expected future undiscounted cash flows, estimated residual value, market trends (such as the effects of leasing demand and competition) and other factors in making this assessment. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows.\nImpairment is then calculated as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, or for assets held for sale, as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value less costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and fair values include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates, interest rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, lease renewal probabilities, tenant vacancy rates and other factors.\nREIT Status\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To maintain our REIT status, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided that we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level federal income tax on the earnings distributed to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities. We are still subject to state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nTable 146:

December 31, 2018, our contractual rental revenue between periods decreased 4.9% as a result of the timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. Included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 were acquisitions of 17 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, and dispositions of 29 properties, with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million.\nThe decrease in contractual rental revenues year-over-year was partially offset by fewer tenant credit issues from 2017 to 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, five and 11 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.3% and 0.7% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.0% and 3.5% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31,\n2018 and 2017, non-cash rental income was $20.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.0% and 5.9%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nIn conjunction with the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes issuance completed in December 2017, the Operating Partnership, as sponsor of the issuance, retained a 5.0% economic interest in the Master Trust 2014 Series 2017-1 notes. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, this holding is reflected as Investment in Master Trust 2014 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and the related interest income resulted in an increase in interest income period-over-period. That increase was offset by a decrease in interest income from mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the pay-off of one $7.5 million mortgage loan collateralized by 26 properties.\nRelated party fee income\nIn conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Asset Management Agreement with SMTA pursuant to which we provide a management team that is responsible for implementing SMTA's business strategy and performing certain services for SMTA. Under this agreement, we recognized $11.7 million of revenues during the period from the Spin- Off to December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, we provide property management services and special services for Master Trust 2014, which was contributed to SMTA as part of the Spin-Off. Therefore, during the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized $4.2 million in revenue under the terms of the Property Management and Servicing Agreement.\nIn January 2019, SMTA announced that due to the bankruptcy of its largest tenant, it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early termination of the Asset Management Agreement and/or the Property Management and Servicing Agreement, in which case we would be entitled to a termination fee. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther income\nThe driver for the increase in other income was the receipt of the final settlement of $19.7 million in relation to the Company's claim from 20 properties leased to Haggen at the time of Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC's bankruptcy in 2015. As a result of this settlement, $19.1 million of other income was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, we recognized other income of $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for pre-payment penalty income when one of our mortgage loans receivable, which was collateralized by 26 properties, was paid off in 2018 prior to its scheduled maturity.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year decrease is a result of decreases in legal fees, primarily as a result of fewer tenant credit issues and internalization of certain legal items, and of decreases in consulting fees, primarily as a result of certain expenses incurred in 2017 related to re-branding and executive team transition, as well as internalization of certain marketing activities.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $20.4 million (including $15.6 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The non-reimbursable costs decreased year-over-year as a result of fewer vacancies and tenant credit issues, while the decrease in reimbursable property costs resulted from decreases in reimbursable property taxes and certain property maintenance expenses. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.7 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the extinguishment of $195.8 million principal outstanding of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt during the year ended December 31, 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense for the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2018 as the facility was not utilized for the first half of 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Term Loan\n</td> <td>6,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - mortgages and notes payable\n</td> <td>26,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>13,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount, net\n</td> <td>10,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 17 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $250.8 million, while disposing 29 properties with a Real Estate Investment Value of $96.4 million. While we were a net acquirer during the period (based on Real Estate Investment Value), depreciation and amortization decreased period-over-period as a result of timing of the acquisition/disposition activity, specifically with the majority of acquisitions closing in the second half of 2018. The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other depreciation\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of lease intangibles\n</td> <td>28,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $6.7 million. $1.9 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $1.3 million recorded on three Vacant held for use properties and $0.6 million recorded on one Vacant held for sale property. The remaining $4.8 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $4.4 million recorded on 17 underperforming held for use properties and $0.4 million recorded on two underperforming held for sale properties.\nImpairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $61.6 million. $45.7 million of the impairment was recorded on Vacant properties, comprised of $34.5 million recorded on 16 Vacant held for use properties and $11.2 million recorded on 11 Vacant held for sale properties. The remaining $15.9 million of impairment was recorded on underperforming properties, comprised of $14.6 million recorded on 12 underperforming held for use properties and $1.3 million recorded on five underperforming held for sale properties.\nGain on debt extinguishment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we extinguished $195.8 million of Master Trust 2013 notes and CMBS debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $27.1 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the extinguishment of $56.2 million of CMBS debt related to six defaulted loans on six underperforming properties, which was partially offset by a loss on the extinguishment of the Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-1 notes and make-whole penalties on early pre-payments of Master Trust 2013 Series 2013-2.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we extinguished $195.4 million of mortgage debt and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.6 million. The gain was primarily attributable to the partial extinguishment of one defaulted mortgage loan upon the sale of one of the properties collateralizing the loan to a third party, offset by net losses from the prepayment and defeasance fees on mortgage debt related to 25 properties.\nGain on disposition of assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we disposed of 29 properties and recorded gains totaling $14.6 million. There were $15.5 million in net gains on the sale of 19 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of four Vacant properties and $0.2 million in net other losses. There were no gains/losses recorded on the transfer of six properties to lenders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 116 properties and recorded net gains totaling $42.7 million. There were $49.7 million in net gains on the sale of 55 active properties. These gains were partially offset by $6.7 million in net losses on the sale of 61 Vacant properties and $0.3 million in net other losses.\nPreferred dividend income from SMTA\nAs part of the Spin-Off of SMTA, SMTA issued to us 10% Series A preferred shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of $150.0 million. During the period from the Spin-Off to December 31, 2018, we recognized preferred dividend income of $8.8 million from these shares. As noted above, in January 2019, SMTA announced it would be accelerating its timeline for strategic alternatives. This acceleration may result in the early repayment of the Series A preferred shares or other outcomes. See related discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors \"Risks Related to our Relationship with SMTA.\"\nOther expense\nWe are contingently liable for $5.7 million of debt owed by one of our former tenants. As a result of the former tenant filing for bankruptcy, we recognized $5.3 million of debt guarantee expense in the current period to fully reserve for the contingent liability.\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations\nSubsequent to the completion of the Spin-Off of SMTA on May 31, 2018, the only activity recognized in discontinued operations were transaction costs associated with the Spin-Off. Therefore, the year ended December 31, 2018 only reflects five months of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off. This resulted in a decrease in (loss) income from discontinued operations compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflects a full year of activity for the assets that were included in the Spin-Off.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS: COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

periods increased by 0.9% as we were a moderate acquirer of income producing real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017. We acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, included in continuing operations, during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was offset by the sale of 116 properties during the same period with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million, of which 58 were income producing properties with a real estate investment value of $254.3 million. This increase in contractual rental revenues was partially offset by tenant credit losses in the first quarter of 2017, where the majority of the non-performing properties were in the convenience store and movie theater industries. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 11 and 28 of our properties in continuing operations were vacant and not generating rent, representing approximately 0.7% and 1.8% of our owned properties.\nAlso included in rental income are tenant reimbursements, where our tenants are obligated under the lease agreement to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur, and non-cash rental income. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below and comprised 3.5% and 2.8% of rental income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Non-cash rental income primarily consists of straight-line rental revenue and amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-cash rental income was $25.0 million and $26.4 million, respectively, representing approximately 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, of total rental income from continuing operations.\nInterest income on loans receivable\nWhile financed properties increased from 69 at December 31, 2016 to 83 at December 31, 2017, resulting in an increase of 28.9% in the related mortgage loans receivable balances for the comparative period, interest income on loans receivable remained flat as all the newly financed mortgage loans in 2017 were originated in the last four months of the year.\nOther income\nThe year-over-year decrease in other income is primarily due to $5.5 million in fee income associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2016, and no comparable transaction for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, lease termination fees collected for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.1 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative\nThe year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to $11.1 million in severance related costs, comprised of $4.2 million of cash compensation and $6.9 million of non-cash compensation, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 following the departure of our chief executive officer. The period-over-period increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in compensation expenses excluding the severance charges, the $1.7 million loss recognized in the comparable prior period related to termination fees on an interest rate swap, and a $1.0 million decrease in professional and other outside services expenses.\nProperty costs (including reimbursable)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, property costs excluding bad debt expense were $26.0 million (including $16.8 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) compared to $24.1 million (including $14.7 million of tenant reimbursable expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The non-reimbursable costs remained relatively flat year-over-year, while reimbursable property costs increased by $2.1 million, driven by an increase in reimbursable property taxes. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.5 million, which reflects the write-off of straight-line rent receivables deemed to be uncollectible, compared to bad debt expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the extinguishment of $195.4 million of mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase in interest due to increased average borrowings year-over-year under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, as well as interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nThe following table summarizes our interest expense on related borrowings from continuing operations:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - 2015 Term Loan\n</td> <td>9,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - mortgages and notes payable\n</td> <td>40,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>13,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of net losses related to interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount/(premium), net\n</td> <td>8,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes facility fees of approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and to amortization of the related lease intangibles. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 38 properties with a real estate investment value of $270.4 million, while we sold 116 properties with a real estate investment value of $381.3 million. However, of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 44 properties with a real estate investment value of $130.2 million that were classified as held for sale. As properties held for sale are no longer depreciated, we were a net acquirer of depreciable property. Further, fewer properties were classified as held for sale in 2017 than in 2016.
