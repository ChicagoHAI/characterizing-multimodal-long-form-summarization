Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nBelmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates 45 properties (with two additional properties scheduled for future openings, the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England and the Belmond Andean Explorer train in Peru).\nBelmond has six reportable segments: owned hotels in (1) Europe, (2) North America (including one stand-alone restaurant) and (3) Rest of world, (4) Owned trains and cruises, (5) Part-owned/ managed hotels and (6) Part-owned/ managed trains.\nBelmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company from its part-owned/managed operations. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company's development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation. There has not been a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nHotels represent the largest part of Belmond's business with the vast majority of the Company's revenues in 2016 , 2015 and 2014, respectively, derived primarily from the Europe, North America and Rest of world segments.\nHotels in 2016 consisted of 29 deluxe hotels which were wholly or majority owned by Belmond or, in the case of Belmond Charleston Place, owned by a consolidated variable interest entity. Eleven of the owned hotels are located in Europe, five in North America and thirteen in the rest of the world. In addition, Belmond owns and operates the stand-alone restaurant \u201821' Club in New York which is included within the North America owned hotels segment.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed segment consists of five hotels which Belmond operates under management contracts in Peru and the United States. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in four of the managed hotels.\nIn recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond's portfolio of unique, high-valued properties as part of management's long-term strategy to reduce leverage and redeploy the capital in properties with higher potential returns.\nIn May 2015, Belmond completed the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain. The gain on sale was reported within gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments in the statements of consolidated operations in the relevant periods.\nIn March 2014, Belmond completed the sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, St. Michaels, Maryland. Belmond has continued to manage the hotel for the new owner. Due to Belmond's continuing involvement in managing the hotel, its results, including the gain on sale, are presented within continuing operations.\nBelmond's owned trains and cruises segment consists of five European tourist trains, two river cruise ships in Myanmar and one French canal cruise business. On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced the operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first luxury overnight train to travel throughout the island of Ireland.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed trains segment consists of two train businesses in Southeast Asia and Peru which Belmond operates under management contracts. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in both trains.\nHotel RevPAR, ADR and occupancy\nRevenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available for the period. Same store RevPAR is a comparison of RevPAR based on the operations of the same units in each period, by excluding the effect of any hotel acquisitions in the period or major refurbishment where a property is closed for a full quarter or longer. The comparison also excludes the effect of dispositions (including discontinued operations) or closures. Management uses RevPAR and same store RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenue and to evaluate the performance of a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nAverage daily rate (\"ADR\") is calculated by dividing room revenue by total rooms sold for the period. Management uses ADR to measure the level of pricing achieved by a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotel's available capacity. Management uses occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nADR and RevPAR are measures for a point in time (a day, month or year) and are most often compared across like time periods. Current ADR and RevPAR are not necessarily indicators of future performance.\nIn 2016, same store RevPAR decreased by 1% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 3% in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $490. In 2015, same store RevPAR decreased by 5% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 11% when measured in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $481.\nBusiness strategy\nBelmond plans to grow the business in the long term by:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>driving top- and bottom-line growth at the Company's existing businesses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stepping up the Company's efforts to continue to build brand awareness, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>positioning the Company for footprint expansion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information, see \"Management Strategies\" in Item 1 - Business.\nRevenue and expenses\nBelmond derives revenue from owned hotel operations primarily from the sale of rooms and the provision of food and beverages. The main factors for analyzing rooms revenue are the number of room nights sold, or occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR, referred to above which is a measure of both these factors.\nThe revenue from the owned trains and cruises segment primarily comprises tickets sold for travel and food and beverage sales.\nRevenue from part-owned/ managed hotels and trains includes fees received under management contracts, which are typically based upon a combination of a percentage of the revenue from operations and operating earnings calculated before specified fixed charges.\nCost of services includes labor, repairs and maintenance, energy and the costs of food and beverages sold to customers in respect of owned hotels, trains and cruises.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include travel agents' commissions, the salaries and related costs of the sales teams, advertising and public relations costs, and the salaries and related costs of management.\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of owned hotels, trains and cruises.\nImpact of foreign currency exchange rate movements\nAs reported below in the comparisons of the 2016, 2015 and 2014 financial years under Results of Operations\u201d, Belmond has exposure arising from the impact of translating its global foreign currency earnings and expenses into U.S. dollars. Ten of Belmond's owned hotels in 2016 operated in euro territories, two in Brazilian real, one in South African rand, one in British pounds sterling, three in Botswana pula, two in Mexican peso, one in Peruvian nuevo sol, one in Russian ruble and six in various Southeast Asian currencies. Revenue of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Belmond British Pullman, Belmond Northern Belle and Belmond Royal Scotsman trains was primarily in British pounds sterling, but the operating costs of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express were mainly denominated in euros. Revenue derived by Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa, Belmond La Samanna and Belmond Miraflores Park was recorded in U.S. dollars, but the majority of the hotels' expenses were denominated in Mexican pesos, euros and Peruvian nuevo soles, respectively. Both revenue and the majority of expenses for Belmond Governor's Residence and Belmond La R\u00e9sidence D'Angkor were recorded in U.S. dollars.\nExcept for the specific instances described above, Belmond's properties match foreign currency earnings and costs as far as possible to provide a natural hedge against currency movements. The reporting of Belmond's revenue and costs translated into U.S. dollars, however, can be materially affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations from period to period.\nConstant currency\nBelmond analyzes certain key financial measures on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Measurement on a constant currency basis means the results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year exchange rates.\nMarket capitalization\nThe Company's class A common share price increased during 2016 to $13.35 at December 31, 2016, from $9.50 at December 31, 2015 and Belmond's market capitalization increased to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2016, from $0.96 billion at December 31, 2015.\nResults of Operations\nBelmond's operating results for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, expressed as a

The increase in net earnings was partially due to an increase in earnings of $6.6 million from the Company's PeruRail joint venture which commenced transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine. This was complemented by an increase in earnings at Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and the reopening of the Belmond Eagle Island Lodge as well as strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. These increases were partially offset by the gain on sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in Madrid of $19.7 million which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 which did not reoccur. In addition, the Company benefited from a decrease in central costs due to lower legal and professional fees and payroll savings related to a weaker British pound than in the prior-year. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million ($1.0 million impairment charge of property, plant and equipment related in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the company benefited from a foreign exchange gain of $9.2 million that was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $16.3 million ($0.16 per common share) on revenue of $551.4 million, compared with net loss of $1.9 million ($0.02 per common share) on revenue of $585.7 million in the prior year. The net earnings in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to the $20.3 million gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments, largely as a result of the May 2015 sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, compared with a $4.1 million gain recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.5 million, which did not reoccur in the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, there was a $9.8 million impairment charge and foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with a $1.2 million impairment charge and a foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue Table 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned hotels:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of world\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>475.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned trains & cruises\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Part-owned/managed hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Part-owned/managed trains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total part-owned/managed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $549.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million, from $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total owned hotels revenue was $475.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.8 million, or 1%, from $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total owned hotels revenue was largely due to a revenue increase of $5.0 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace due to the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and a revenue increase of $3.1 million in Belmond Safaris, Botswana, following the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge which was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. This was offset by a revenue decrease of $4.9 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Venice, Italy due to a challenging comparable period, with revenue in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Revenue from total owned trains and cruises was $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 9%, from $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of a combined revenue decline of $1.2 million at the Company's two river cruises in Myanmar and a fall in revenue of $4.3 million at the Company's European trains due to the year-over-year depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. This was slightly offset by revenue growth of $1.7 million at Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $34.3 million, or 6%, from $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total owned hotels revenue was $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 5%, from $498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in total hotels revenue was principally attributable to a $37.6 million and $25.7 million fall in revenue at the Company's European and Brazilian hotels due to unfavorable exchange rate movements, partially offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $24.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Revenue from owned trains and cruises was $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $8.8 million, or 12%, from $74.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of revenue declines at the Company's two river cruise ships in Myanmar and Belmond Northern Belle.\nOwned hotels - Europe Table 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rooms Available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rooms Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy (percentage)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily rate (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million from $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to a revenue decrease of $4.9 million or 13% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani partially due to a challenging comparative period, with revenue for 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Partially offsetting this decline, Belmond Reid's Palace increased revenue by $2.5 million due to a 18% increase in occupancy, which largely resulted from the Company's strategic decision to focus on driving wholesale business in order to gain market share during the destination's slow season. In addition, revenue for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $3.0 million over the prior-year period mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a reduction in rates in Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons and Belmond Grand Hotel Europe. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment decreased to $676 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $689 in the year ended December 31, 2015.

This decrease was attributable to unfavorable exchange rate movements which contributed to $37.6 million of the revenue decline, following the 37%, 16% and 7% year-over-year depreciation of the Russian ruble, euro and British pound, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. This was partially offset by revenue growth of $24.9 million on a constant currency basis at the Company's European hotels. The Italian properties were responsible for $15.0 million of this growth, having achieved a 10% increase in constant currency ADR and a 4 percentage-point increase in occupancy. Additionally, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe recorded an increase in revenue of $5.2 million on a constant currency basis, having benefited from increased local and foreign demand and food and beverage growth with the opening of the new Azia\u201d restaurant.

This decrease was largely attributable to a $1.9 million revenue decline at Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa and a $1.2 million decline in revenue at \u201821' Club by Belmond. Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa was impacted by increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area of Mexico. \u201821' Club by Belmond was negatively impacted by volatility in stock markets as well as disruption caused by neighboring construction noise. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 million revenue increase at Belmond Charleston Place. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product following the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015.

This revenue increase was led by a $2.8 million growth at Belmond El Encanto as it continued to benefit from its second full year of operations. In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in revenue at Belmond Charleston Place, following increased occupancy and strong ADR growth as a result of the hotel's renovated room product. Revenue increases of $1.6 million in the other North American owned hotels were offset by the March 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, which had generated revenues of $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

This is principally as a result of revenue growth of $5.0 million or 10% at Belmond Copacabana Palace and revenue growth of $3.1 million at Belmond Safaris. At Belmond Copacabana Palace, the Company successfully capitalized on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, driving year-over-year ADR and food and beverage revenue growth. Belmond Safaris benefited from being fully operational in 2016, as Belmond Eagle Island Lodge re-opened in December 2015 having been closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. This was partially offset by a revenue decrease of $1.6 million at Belmond La R\u00e9sidence d'Ankor, which was closed for refurbishment in May 2016 and re-opened in November 2016.

This decrease was primarily attributable to the $17.7 million combined revenue decline at the Company's two Brazilian hotels, largely due to the 30% year-over-year depreciation in the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, there was a decrease in revenue of $3.2 million at Belmond Safaris as a result of the closure of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge for renovation in January 2015. Partially offsetting these decreases in 2015 was a $3.2 million growth at Belmond Miraflores Park, which was closed for renovation from December 2013 to mid-April 2014. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the Rest of world segment decreased by 14% to $356 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $413 in the year ended December 31, 2014. Occupancy increased to 57% in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 56% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Same store RevPAR (which excludes Belmond Miraflores Park and Belmond Eagle Island Lodge) decreased by 14% to $200 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $233 in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis.\nOwned trains and cruises\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $59.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 9%, from $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Unfavorable exchange rate movements of $5.9 million resulting from the 11% year-over-year depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar, were partially offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $1.7\nmillion at Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016 and generated $1.2 million of revenue in its first few weeks of operations. In addition, on a constant currency basis there was a revenue increase of $1.4 million at Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express due to the increase in number of trips by four in the period. This was offset by a combined revenue decrease of $1.2 million on a constant currency basis at Belmond Road to Mandalay and Belmond Orcaella, the Company's two river cruise ships in Myanmar, as a result of increased local competition.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $8.8 million, or 12%, from $74.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Exchange rate movements accounted for $4.0 million of the revenue decline, following the 16% and 7% year-over-year depreciation of the euro and British pound, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. There was a combined revenue decrease of $4.6 million at Belmond Orcaella and Belmond Road to Mandalay, Belmond's two river cruise ships in Myanmar, as a result of increased local competition, and a $1.6 million fall in revenue at Belmond Northern Belle following a reduction in passenger numbers.\nPart-owned/ managed hotels\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 15%, from $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in May 2015 which had produced revenues of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a decline in revenue for the Company's Peru hotels joint venture primarily as a result of a year-over-year decrease in group business at the joint venture's two hotels in Cusco.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 13%, from $6.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower management fees received from Hotel Ritz by Belmond which was sold in May 2015.\nPart-owned/ managed trains\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $10.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.6 million, or 32%, from $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting from the Company's PeruRail joint venture which commenced transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.8 million, or 11%, from $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This was due to an increase in management fees from the Company's PeruRail joint venture, as a result of an increase in tickets sold and average ticket prices.\nIn June 2015, PeruRail entered into an agreement for a period of 15 years with a Peruvian subsidiary of MMG Limited, a minerals and mining company that is publicly traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange, to transport copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine. In connection with this project, PeruRail obtained non-recourse financing of $131 million in February 2016. PeruRail commenced transport of the copper concentrate in January 2016.\nCost of services\n2016 compared to 2015\nCost of services was $240.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 1%, from $243.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Cost of services as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 44% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nCost of services was $243.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $19.0 million, or 7%, from $262.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 44% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 from 45% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2016 compared to 2015\nSelling, general and administrative expenses was $198.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $7.6 million, or 4%, from $206.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 36% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 37% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCentral costs within selling, general and administrative expenses were $37.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (including $6.3 million of non-cash share-based compensation), a decrease of $9.4 million, or 20%, from $46.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 (including $6.7 million of non-cash share-based compensation). As a percentage of revenue, central costs (excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense) decreased slightly to 6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower legal and professional expenses and payroll savings related to a weaker British pound than in the prior-year.\n2015 compared to 2014\nSelling, general and administrative expenses was $206.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $13.4 million, or 6%, from $219.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 despite the increase in central costs. This was primarily due to the weakening of the euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, which in turn has benefited Belmond La Samanna and Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa as these properties incur the majority of their expenses in euros and Mexican pesos, respectively.\nCentral costs within selling, general and administrative expenses were $46.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 (including $6.7 million of non-cash share-based compensation), an increase of $6.4 million, or 16%, from $40.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (including $7.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation). Central costs included $3.7 million of expenses and a $1.8 million credit to share-based compensation expense in relation to the former CEO's departure. The remaining increase is largely due to additional costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to the migration of the Company's tax residency to the United Kingdom and central marketing costs. As a percentage of revenue, central costs (excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense) increased to 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 6% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSegment profit/(loss)\nSegment performance is evaluated based upon segment earnings before gains/(losses) on disposal, impairments, central costs, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency, tax (including tax on earnings from unconsolidated companies), depreciation and amortization ( segment profit\u201d). Segment performance for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014 is analyzed as follows:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to solid performances for the Company's Italian hotels complemented by strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. Earnings for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $1.7 million over the prior-year mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a decrease in earnings of $2.6 million in Belmond Hotel Cipriani due to a challenging comparable period, with earnings in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Outside of Italy, the Company recorded meaningful year-over-year increases for Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond La Residencia, and Belmond Reid's Palace, all primarily as a result of driving demand from new markets coupled with enhanced revenue management. Earnings for Belmond\nGrand Hotel Europe increased $0.8 million or 15% year-over-year largely due to an increase in occupancy that was primarily the result of continued efforts to stimulate business from new markets. The Company continued to drive improved results for Belmond La Residencia, with earnings for the year increasing $1.1 million or 25% over the prior year mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. Earnings for Belmond Reid's Palace increased $1.6 million or 37% year on year which largely resulted from the Company's strategic decision to focus on driving wholesale business in order to gain market share during the destination's slow season. As a percentage of European owned hotels revenue, segment profit was 34% in the year December 31, 2016 compared with 33% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe North American owned hotels reported segment profit of $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 9%, from $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was largely due to a combined earnings decrease of $2.6 million at '21' Club by Belmond, Belmond La Samanna, St. Martin, Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa and Belmond El Encanto. '21' Club by Belmond was negatively impacted by volatility in stock markets as well as disruption caused by neighboring construction noise resulting in an earnings decrease of $0.7 million. Belmond La Samanna suffered a decrease in segment profit of $0.8 million due to a year-over-year decrease in call volume due in part to concern over the Zika virus. In addition, there was a $0.6 million earnings decline at Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa due to increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area. Belmond El Encanto recorded a decline in earnings of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a fall in food and beverage revenue and a reduction in group business, primarily as a result of a large buyout in the prior year which did not recur in the current year. As a percentage of North American owned hotels revenue, segment profit was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 21% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Rest of world owned hotels reported segment profit of $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.8 million, or 6%, from $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Unfavorable exchange rate movements of $1.4 million resulting from the year-over-year depreciation largely of the Brazilian real and South African rand against the U.S. dollar, were offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $3.2 million, particularly at Belmond Copacabana Palace, Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel and Belmond Safaris. At Belmond Copacabana Palace, the Company successfully capitalized on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, driving year-over-year ADR and food and beverage revenue growth for the third quarter of 2016. Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel achieved strong constant currency ADR growth due to the investments made to renovate the hotel's room product over the past several years. Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel also benefited from the year-over-year depreciation of the South African rand which has increased the number of international tourists to the area. Belmond Safaris recorded an earnings increase of $1.8 million on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, one of the three safari camps in Botswana, which closed for renovations in January 2015. The increases in segment profit were somewhat offset by decreases in segment profit on a constant currency basis at Belmond Cataratas and Belmond La Residence d'Angkor of $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Belmond Cataratas suffered from a decrease in occupancy due to in part to concerns over the Zika virus and a post-Olympics lull. Belmond La R\u00e9sidence d'Angkor was closed for refurbishment in May 2016 and re-opened in November 2016. As a percentage of Rest of world owned hotels revenue, segment profit margin was consistent at 25% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Owned trains and cruises reported segment profit of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 43%, from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was predominately due to combined earnings growth of $0.5 million at Belmond British Pullman and Belmond Northern Belle offset by a combined earnings decrease of $1.1 million at Belmond Road to Mandalay and Belmond Orcaella, the Company's river cruise ships in Myanmar, as a result of increased local competition. Segment profit for Belmond Royal Scotsman was down $0.3 million on a constant currency basis or 18% primarily as a result of operating two fewer trips in the current-year. Earnings decreased by $1.1 million at Venice Simplon-Orient-Express due to higher costs incurred as a result of unfavorable exchange rate movements. As a percentage of owned trains and cruises revenue, segment profit decreased to 6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 10% for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to higher costs incurred than the prior year.\nThe Part-owned/ managed hotels reported segment profit of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million, or 26%, from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is primarily due to the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in May 2015 which produced segment losses of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Part-owned/ managed trains reported segment profit of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 35%, from $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the Company's PeruRail joint venture commencing transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine, which began production in January 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe European owned hotels reported segment profit of $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.6 million, or 4%, from $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly attributable to earnings growth\nat the Italian properties and Belmond Reid's Palace of $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, following strong occupancy growth and despite the weakening of the euro, partially offset by a $0.5 million fall in segment profit at Belmond Grand Hotel Europe primarily as a result of the depreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. As a percentage of European owned hotels revenue, segment profit was 33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 30% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe North American owned hotels reported segment profit of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $7.6 million, or 32%, from $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. There was an increase in earnings of $2.0 million at Belmond La Samanna, which was negatively impacted in 2014 by a mosquito-borne virus in St. Martin and elsewhere in the Caribbean which did not recur in 2015, and also benefited from the impact of the weaker euro on its cost base. In addition, Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa recorded earnings growth of $1.8 million following a 4% increase in ADR and payroll costs savings, and Belmond El Encanto and Belmond Charleston Place reported increases in earnings of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. As a percentage of North American owned hotels revenue, segment profit was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 17% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Rest of world owned hotels reported segment profit of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 14%, from $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. There was a fall in segment profit of $8.7 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace in 2015 following the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and the effect of a strong comparative year as a result of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and a fall of $1.7 million at Belmond Safaris due to the closure of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge. Partially offsetting these declines was a $2.8 million earnings growth at Belmond Miraflores Park, which was closed for renovation during the beginning months of 2014 and a $1.8 million earnings growth at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel following increased occupancy. As a percentage of Rest of world owned hotels revenue, segment profit margin was 25% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 26% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Owned trains and cruises reported segment profit of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 8%, from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was predominantly due to earnings growth at Venice Simplon-Orient-Express of $2.0 million being offset by declines in segment profit at the Company's two river cruises in Myanmar of $2.5 million as a result of increased local competition. As a percentage of owned trains and cruises, segment profit was consistent at 10% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Part-owned/managed hotels reported segment profit of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 14%, from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to a segment loss of $1.9 million recognized for Hotel Ritz by Belmond in the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of additional costs incurred by the joint venture in association with its sale in May 2015, compared with a segment loss of $0.6 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements.\nThe Part-owned/ managed trains reported segment profit of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.7 million, or 17%, from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in average ticket prices and the number of passenger tickets sold at the Company's PeruRail joint venture.\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments\n2016 compared to 2015\nA gain on disposal of $0.9 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with a $20.3 million gain in the year ended December 31, 2015. The gain in the in the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the recognition of the $0.6 million deferred gain following the March 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, which Belmond has continued to manage under a management contract. The remainder of the 2016 gain relates to the gain on sale of the spa building at Belmond Casa de Sierra Nevada, Mexico in September 2016. $19.7 million of the gain recorded in 2015 relates to Hotel Ritz by Belmond, the Company's hotel joint venture in Spain, which was sold on May 21, 2015, with the remainder relating to the recognition of the deferred gain following the 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond.\n2015 compared to 2014\nA gain on disposal of $20.3 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with a $4.1 million gain in the year ended December 31, 2014. $19.7 million of the gain recorded in 2015 relates to Hotel Ritz by Belmond, the Company's hotel joint venture in Spain, which was sold on May 21, 2015, with the remainder relating to the recognition of the deferred gain following the 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond. The gain in the prior year relates solely to Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, which was sold on March 21, 2014. The disposal resulted in a gain of $6.7 million, of which $3.7 million was recognized on completion on March 21, 2014 and $3.0 million, relating to Belmond's key money contribution, was deferred and is being recognized over the initial period of the management contract. Due to Belmond's continuing involvement in managing the hotel, the results of operations of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond and the gain on disposal have been recorded within continuing operations.\nImpairment of goodwill\n2016 compared to 2015\nThere were no impairments of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. A goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015. This consisted of $4.1 million at Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, $3.6 million at Belmond Jimbaran Puri Bali, $1.4 million at Belmond La Residence Pho Vao, Luang Prabang, Laos and $0.7 million at Belmond Northern Belle.

There were no impairments to goodwill of continuing operations recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\n2016 compared to 2015\nA property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $1.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 which related to the write-down to fair value of property, plant and equipment at Belmond Orcaella, one of the Company's river cruises in Myanmar. There were no impairments of property, plant and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 7 for consideration of potential impairment triggers.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThere were no impairments of property, plant and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, Belmond identified and recorded a non-cash property, plant and equipment charge of $1.2 million relating to the write-down to fair value of train carriages of Belmond's former Great South Pacific Express train, which were at the time held in Australia and were not in service.\nDepreciation and amortization\n2016 compared to 2015\nDepreciation and amortization was $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.9 million, or 4%, from $50.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is primarily due to a $1.3 million accelerated depreciation charge on assets as part of the renovation project at Belmond La Residence d'Angkor.\n2015 compared to 2014\nDepreciation and amortization was $50.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 3% from $52.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 9% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nGain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt\n2016 compared to 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.2 million. Charleston Center LLC refinanced its $86.0 million loan secured on its real and personal property with an amended $112.0 million loan. The additional proceeds of $26.0 million were largely used to repay a 1984 development loan from a municipal agency in the principal amount of $10.0 million and accrued interest of $16.8 million. There was a cash outflow of $22.8 million to repay this loan and accrued interest, reflecting a discount of $4.0 million which was negotiated due to the early repayment of this loan. The net gain on extinguishment of debt reported in the statements of consolidated operations was $1.2 million after accounting for a tax indemnity of $2.8 million to our partners in respect of their income from the discount arising on the cancellation of indebtedness. There was no loss/gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThere was no gain/loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising costs associated with the March 2014 corporate debt refinancing, including an $8.9 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, $4.0 million in swap cancellation costs and $1.3 million of fees to prepay Belmond's previous loans.\nOther income\n2016 compared to 2015\nThere was no other income recognized in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThere was no other income recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther income of $1.3 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. This related to the release of the remaining contingent liability that was originally recorded as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo and Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea in January 2010. Belmond had agreed to pay the vendor a further \u20ac5,000,000 (equivalent to $7,064,000 at date of acquisition) if, by 2015, additional rooms were constructed at Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo and certain required permits were granted to expand and add a swimming pool to Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea. At December 31, 2014, \u20ac4,000,000 has been paid ( equivalent to $5,250,000 at the dates paid) as the Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea permits were granted. The remaining contingent consideration was released in December 2014 as the conditions for its payment were not met.\nInterest income, interest expense and foreign currency, net\n2016 compared to 2015\nInterest income, interest expense and foreign currency, net was an expense of $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $17.1 million, or 47%, from an expense of $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net expense was primarily due to a foreign exchange gain of $9.2 million that was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016 due to recent volatility in the British pound and euro foreign exchange rates, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nInterest income, interest expense and foreign currency, net was an expense of $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $3.1 million, or 9%, from an expense of $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2015 there was a foreign exchange loss recognized of $5.0 million compared with a gain of $2.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the release of a provision for a withholding tax assessment previously classified as interest.\nProvision for income taxes\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe provision for income taxes was $16.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 4%, from $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in tax charge in the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly as a result of a reduction in provision for uncertain tax position of $3.4 million following settlements agreed in October 2016, which was partially offset by an increase in earnings before income taxes in the United States, Italy, Brazil and other territories. The effective tax rate is higher than the UK statutory tax rate mainly because the Company operates in a number of territories which have higher statutory tax rates than the UK.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe provision for income taxes was $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.5 million, or 10%, from $15.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in tax expense was principally due to an increase in earnings before income taxes in the United States, Italy, Peru and other territories.\nEarnings from unconsolidated companies, net of tax\n2016 compared to 2015\nEarnings from unconsolidated companies, net of tax was $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.9 million, or 21%, from $9.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This was largely due to increased net profits achieved at the Company's PeruRail joint venture.\n2015 compared to 2014\nEarnings from unconsolidated companies, net of tax was $9.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 4%, from $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. There was a tax charge of $1.5 million recognized in relation to earnings from unconsolidated companies in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with a tax credit of $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The tax credit in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the reduction in enacted tax rates in Peru and Spain.\nNet earnings/(losses) from discontinued operations\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.0 million, compared to net losses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 comprised of the reimbursement of overpaid legal fees in relation to Ubud Hanging Gardens, as Belmond is pursuing legal remedies following the wrongful dispossession by the owner in November 2013 (see Notes 4 and 19 to the Financial Statements) and residual operating losses from Porto Cupecoy which was sold in January 2013. In addition, the results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 included earnings of $963,000 at Porto Cupecoy due to the release of a provision in respect of tax claims that Belmond believes it is now effectively discharged from. See Note 19.\nNet losses from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included legal fees of $0.6 million in relation to Belmond's wrongful dispossession from its leasehold interest in Ubud Hanging Gardens and residual operating losses of $0.9 million at Porto Cupecoy.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet losses from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.5 million, compared to net losses of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet losses from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included legal fees of $0.6 million in relation to Ubud Hanging Gardens, as Belmond is pursuing legal remedies following the wrongful dispossession by the owner in November 2013 and residual operating losses of $0.9 million at Porto Cupecoy.\nNet losses from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included legal fees of $1.5 million in relation to Belmond's wrongful dispossession from its leasehold interest in Ubud Hanging Gardens and residual operating losses of $1.6 million at Porto Cupecoy.\nOther comprehensive losses: Foreign currency translation adjustments, net\n2016 compared to 2015\nForeign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were a loss of $11.0 million compared to a loss of $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 arising from the retranslation of Belmond's net investment in subsidiary accounts denominated in foreign currencies into the Company's reporting currency of U.S. dollars.\nThe loss in the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven by a 3% and 17% depreciation, of the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar from the rate at December 31, 2015, negatively impacting the carrying value of Belmond's net investments denominated in those currencies. The improvement in loss in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the loss in the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a 20%, 20% and 13% appreciation, respectively, of the Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the South African rand against the U.S. dollar from the rate at December 31, 2015 positively impacted the carrying value of Belmond's net investments denominated in those currencies.\n2015 compared to 2014\nForeign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were a loss of $88.2 million compared to a loss of $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss in the year ended December 31, 2015 largely resulted from the retranslation of Belmond's net investment in subsidiary accounts denominated in foreign currencies into the Belmond's reporting currency of U.S. dollars as the majority of Belmond's operating currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar during the year. The loss was driven by a 32%, 23% and 10% depreciation, respectively, of the Brazilian real, Russian ruble and euro against the U.S. dollar from the rate at December 31, 2014, negatively impacting the carrying value of Belmond's net investments denominated in those currencies.\nThe foreign currency translation adjustment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially due to the 72% and 14% depreciation, respectively, of the Russian ruble and euro against the U.S. dollar, and partially due to a loss of $49.4 million arising on the remeasurement of non-monetary assets and liabilities of Belmond's Brazilian operations following a change in the functional currency of those entities. Prior to 2014, Belmond's Brazilian operations used the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Effective January 1, 2014, Belmond changed the functional currency to the Brazilian real. Belmond believes that the growth in the Brazilian operations' real-denominated revenues and expenses indicated a change in the economic facts and circumstances that justified the change in the functional currency.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nBelmond's primary short-term cash needs include payment of compensation, general business expenses, capital commitments and contractual payment obligations, which include principal and interest payment on its debt facilities. Long-term liquidity needs may include existing and ongoing property refurbishments, potential investment in strategic acquisitions, and the repayment of long-term debt. At December 31, 2016, total debt and obligations under capital leases, including debt of consolidated variable interest entities, amounted to $602.1 million (2015 - $596.5 million), including a current portion of $5.3 million (2015 - $5.3 million). See Note 10 to the Financial Statements. Additionally, Belmond had capital commitments at December 31, 2016 amounting to $7.8 million (2015 - $8.7 million).\nBelmond had cash and cash equivalents of $153.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $135.6 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, Belmond had restricted cash balances of $2.6 million, of which $1.8 million is classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet and $0.8 million is classified in other assets (2015 - $3.3 million, of which $2.6 million is classified as restricted cash and $0.7 million is classified in other assets). At December 31, 2016, there were undrawn amounts available to Belmond under committed short-term lines of credit of $105.5 million (2015 - $106.1 million), bringing total cash availability at December 31,\n2016 to $258.9 million (2015 - $241.7 million), excluding restricted cash. When assessing liquidity, Belmond management considers the availability of those cash resources held within local business units to meet the strategic needs of Belmond.\nAt December 31, 2016, Belmond had $5.3 million of scheduled debt repayments due within one year. Belmond expects to meet these repayments and fund working capital and capital expenditure commitments for the foreseeable future from cash resources, operating cash flow and available committed borrowing.\nIn order to ensure that Belmond has sufficient liquidity for the future, Belmond's cash flow projections and available funds are reviewed with the Company's board of directors on a regular basis.\nRecent Events Affecting Belmond's Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn March 2015, Belmond's board of directors approved a program enabling the Company to repurchase its shares of class A common stock up to the value of $75.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Belmond repurchased and retired 233,393 shares of class A common stock at a weighted average price of $8.54 per share and an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. The shares repurchased represented approximately 0.2% of the Company's total shares of class A common stock outstanding prior to the repurchase. To date the Company has acquired 3,574,667 shares of class A common stock for consideration of $40.0 million.\nCovenant Compliance\nBelmond is financed with a $489.0 million secured term loan and a $105.0 million revolving credit facility. The credit agreement limits Belmond's ability to incur additional debt unless certain covenants are met. These covenants are measured on the performance of the consolidated group. The revolving credit facility in the credit agreement contains two financial covenants, a maximum net leverage test and a minimum interest cover test, which are both measured quarterly based on Belmond's trailing 12 months results. In addition, there is debt held by consolidated variable interest entities of $113.1 million relating to Charleston Center LLC. One of the loans ($112.0 million) contains two financial covenants, a minimum interest cover test and minimum debt service ratio, both measured quarterly based on the trailing 12 months results of Charleston Center LLC.\nIf Belmond does not comply with its financial covenants and the banks that provide the revolving credit facility declare a default and accelerate the repayment of their debt, this will cause an event of default under the credit agreement. The cross default threshold in the credit agreement to other debt that is recourse to Belmond is $25.0 million.\nBelmond closely monitors projected covenant compliance, and if there were a possibility of non-compliance with a covenant, Belmond would proactively meet with the agent or lending bank or banks of the relevant facility to seek an amendment or waiver. Obtaining a waiver may result in additional bank fees or an increase in the interest cost.\nBased on its current financial forecasts, Belmond believes it will comply with all of the financial covenants in its loan facilities.\nWorking Capital\nCurrent assets less current liabilities, including the current portion of long-term debt, resulted in a working capital surplus of $107.4 million at December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 - $91.2 million).\nCash Flow - Sources and Uses of Cash\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, Belmond had cash and cash equivalents of $153.4 million and $135.6 million, respectively. In addition, Belmond had restricted cash balances of $2.6 million (of which $1.8 million is classified as current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet and $0.8 million is classified in other assets) and $3.3 million (of which $2.6 million is classified as current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet and $0.7 million is classified in other assets) as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $61.5 million compared to $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe primary driver of operating cash flows is the result for the period, adjusted for any non-cash components. Net earnings from continuing operations were $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of $18.0 million compared to earnings of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $14.3 million cash outflow to settle accrued interest on Charleston Center LLC's 1984 development loan from a public agency and a\n$1.2 million gain on extinguishment of debt. See Financing Activities below and Note 10 to the Financial Statements for further information. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on disposal of $19.7 million in relation to the sale of Belmond's equity method investment in Hotel Ritz by Belmond and goodwill impairments totaling $9.8 million in relation to the goodwill of Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Jimbaran Puri, Belmond La R\u00e9sidence Phou Vao and Belmond Northern Belle, non-cash items affecting net cash used in operating activities which did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016. Lastly, operating cash flows were affected by the fact that net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, included a non-cash gain from foreign currency translation of $9.2 million, compared to a non-cash loss from foreign currency translation of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet earnings from continuing operations were $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an improvement of $15.4 million compared to earnings of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014 Belmond paid swap termination costs of $4.0 million and key money in relation to the management agreement of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond of $3.0 million, neither of which cash outflows recurred in the year ended December 31, 2015. This improvement is offset in cash terms by the fact that the net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.5 million. Additional non-cash items affecting the calculation of net cash provided by operating activities included impairments totaling $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 in relation to the goodwill of Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Jimbaran Puri, Belmond La R\u00e9sidence Phou Vao and Belmond Northern Belle, compared to a $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 in relation to the property, plant and equipment of Belmond's former Great South Pacific Express train which was held in Australia and was not in service. The year ended December 31, 2015 also included a non-cash gain on disposal of $19.7 million in relation to the sale of Belmond's equity method investment in Hotel Ritz by Belmond, compared to a gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $4.1 million in relation to the sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $52.4 million compared to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCapital expenditure of $55.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $8.1 million at Belmond Charleston Place related to the cost of adding a new high-end sports pub which opened in July 2016 as well as for roof replacement works, $5.3 million on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express related to statutory maintenance works and the phased installation of air-conditioning, $5.2 million at Belmond La Residence d'Angkor primarily for a rooms renovation project, $5.2 million at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel for the renovation of rooms in the hotel's main building, $4.5 million on the Belmond Grand Hibernian luxury sleeper train which commenced operations in August 2016, with the balance being for routine capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditure of $56.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 included $10.5 million at Belmond Charleston Place primarily for the hotel's rooms renovation project, $6.0 million at Belmond Safaris primarily for the renovation of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, $5.5 million for construction of the Belmond Grand Hibernian luxury sleeper train, $4.3 million at Belmond Grand Hotel Europe primarily for the renovation of the hotel's main kitchen and new restaurant, $4.1 million on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Belmond British Pullman primarily related to statutory safety works, $3.5 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani primarily for the renovation of 16 rooms in the hotel's main building, $2.9 million at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel primarily for the renovation of banqueting and meeting rooms, $2.2 million at Belmond La Residencia primarily for a new bar and refurbishment of 12 junior suites, $2.1 million at Belmond Hotel Splendido primarily for the refurbishment of ten rooms, $2.1 million at Belmond Villa San Michele primarily for a new function facility and $2.1 million at Belmond Villa Sant' Andrea primarily to purchase an adjacent property and beach concession, with the balance being for routine capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditure of $63.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 included $15.3 million at Belmond Charleston Place primarily for the first and second phases of the hotel's rooms renovation project, $10.7 million at Belmond Grand Hotel Europe primarily for the conversion of 19 historic rooms into six suites and renovations of the hotel's restaurants and meeting rooms, $5.0 million at Belmond Miraflores Park for the hotel's renovation, $3.9 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani primarily for the renovation of the hotel's new Oro restaurant, $3.1 million at Belmond Hotel Splendido primarily for the renovation of several of the hotel's rooms and suites, $2.9 million at Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea primarily for the six junior suites that opened in May 2014, $2.7 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace for the renovation of the hotel's new MEE restaurant and other routine capital expenditure, $3.8 million on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Belmond British Pullman primarily related to statutory maintenance works, $2.4 million at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel primarily for the renovation of 26 suites and cottages and $2.3 million at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons primarily for the construction of a new conservatory in the hotel's garden, with the balance being for routine capital expenditures.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, disposal of the trains and carriages that were formerly operated as the Great South Pacific Express and a spa building at Belmond Casa de Sierra Nevada resulted in net cash proceeds of $2.7 million. The disposal of the spa building resulted in a gain of $0.3 million, which was recognized on completion and is reported within gain on sale from property, plant and equipment and equity method investments. No gain or loss arose on disposal of the train carriages.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, disposal of Belmond's equity method investment in Hotel Ritz by Belmond resulted in net cash proceeds of $43.7 million. The disposal resulted in a gain of $19.7 million, which was recognized on completion and is reported within gain on sale from property, plant and equipment and equity method investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, disposal of non-core assets of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond resulted in net cash proceeds of $37.8 million. The disposal resulted in a gain of $6.7 million, of which $3.7 million was recognized on completion on March 21, 2014 and $3.0 million, relating to Belmond's key money contribution, was deferred to be recognized over the initial period of the management contract. Belmond continues to manage the hotel for the new owner under a management agreement with a ten-year term that permits termination on the fifth anniversary of the agreement. Due to Belmond's continuing involvement in managing the hotel, its results are presented within continuing operations.\nRelease of restricted cash was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the release of restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by the repayment of the outstanding property level funded debt of Belmond with the exception of Charleston Center LLC, a consolidated VIE, which took place in March 2014. Cash deposits were previously required to be held with lending banks to support Belmond's payment of interest and principal. There was a smaller increase in restricted cash in the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, attributable to the fact that these cash deposits with lending banks are no longer required, with the exception of the debt held by Charleston Center LLC.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and cash used in financing activities of $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced its $86.0 million loan secured on its real and personal property with an amended $112.0 million loan. The additional proceeds of $26.0 million was largely used to repay a 1984 development loan from a municipal agency in the principal amount of $10.0 million and accrued interest of $16.8 million. There was a cash outflow of $22.8 million to repay this loan and accrued interest, reflecting a discount of $4.0 million which was negotiated due to the early repayment of this loan. The net gain on extinguishment of debt reported in the statements of consolidated operations was $1.2 million after accounting for a tax indemnity of $2.8 million to our partners. Including this refinancing, principal repayments under long-term debt were therefore $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe year ended December 31, 2016 included a cash outflow of $2.0 million in relation to repurchases of Belmond's shares of class A common stock, compared to $37.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, Belmond drew $5.4 million of loans to fund capital expenditure at Belmond Miraflores Park and Belmond Grand Hotel Europe and refinanced a $12.0 million loan secured on Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel. Subsequent to these drawdowns, Belmond entered into a $552.0 million secured term loan, the proceeds of which were used to repay all outstanding funded debt of Belmond apart from the debt of Charleston Center LLC, a consolidated VIE, and the debt of Belmond's unconsolidated joint venture companies. In August 2014, the debt of Charleston Center LLC was refinanced, resulting in an additional drawdown of $2.8 million. Principal repayments under long-term debt were $565.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations. The results of Ubud Hanging Gardens and Porto Cupecoy, have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Ubud Hanging Gardens has been accounted for as a discontinued operation following an unannounced dispossession of Belmond from the hotel by the owner in November 2013. See Notes 4 and 19 to the Financial Statements.\nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities comprises the results of operations for the discontinued operations noted above and the movement in their assets and liabilities. Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to losses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and losses of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 largely relates to the release of a provision at Porto Cupecoy in respect of tax claims that Belmond believes it is now effectively discharged from. See Note 19. The results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include legal fees of $0.6\nmillion and $1.5 million, respectively, in relation to Ubud Hanging Gardens, as Belmond is pursuing legal remedies following its wrongful dispossession by the owner.\nCapital Commitments\nBelmond routinely makes capital expenditures to enhance its business. These capital expenditures relate to maintenance, improvements to existing properties and investment in new properties. These capital commitments are expected to be funded through current cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing debt facilities.\nThere were $7.8 million of capital commitments outstanding at December 31, 2016 (2015 - $8.7 million) relating to project developments and refurbishment for existing properties.\nIndebtedness\nAt December 31, 2016, Belmond had $602.1 million (2015 - $596.5 million) of consolidated debt and obligations under capital leases, including the current portion and including debt held by consolidated variable interest entities. Total debt on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 of $591.1 million (2015 - $582.9 million) is net of the unamortized original issue discount of $1.5 million (2015 - $1.9 million) and unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.5 million (2015 - $11.7 million), both of which will be amortized through interest expense over the term of the loans.\nBelmond is financed with a $489.0 million secured term loan and a $105.0 million revolving credit facility.\nThe term loan has two tranches, a U.S. dollar tranche ($335.5 million currently outstanding) and a euro-denominated tranche (\u20ac145.9 million currently outstanding, equivalent to $153.5 million as at December 31, 2016). The dollar tranche bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3% per annum, and the euro tranche bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 3% per annum. Both tranches are subject to a 1% interest rate floor. The loan matures in 2021 and the annual mandatory amortization is 1% of the principal amount.\nThe revolving credit facility matures in March 2019 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, with a commitment fee of 0.4% paid on the undrawn amount. At December 31, 2016 the facility was undrawn and including other working capital facilities, the Company has $105.5 million available to draw.\nThe term loan and revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of shares in certain subsidiaries and by security interests in tangible and intangible personal property. There are no mortgages over real estate.\nThe weighted average duration of Belmond's debt, including debt held by consolidated variable interest entities, is 3.9 years, and the weighted average interest rate is 4.27%, which incorporates derivatives used to mitigate interest rate risk. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements regarding the maturity of long-term debt.\nDebt of consolidated variable interest entities at December 31, 2016 included above comprised $113.1 million (2015 - $97.3 million), including the current portion but before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs, of debt obligations of Charleston Center LLC, owner of Belmond Charleston Place in which Belmond has a 19.9% equity investment.\nIn August 2014, Charleston Center LLC entered into an $86.0 million loan secured on its real and personal property. This loan had a 2019 maturity and bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.12% per annum. In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced this loan with a $112.0 million new loan with the same 2019 maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is LIBOR plus 2.35% per annum, and the loan has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional proceeds were used to repay a 1984 development loan from a public agency and associated accrued interest.\nIncluding debt of consolidated variable entities, approximately 25% of the outstanding principal was drawn in euros and the balance in U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2016, 52% of borrowings of Belmond were subject to floating interest rates.\nBelmond has contingently guaranteed debt obligations of certain of its joint ventures. The following table summarizes these commitments at December 31, 2016:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contingent guarantee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Duration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PeruRail joint venture:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Concession performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>through May 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peru hotel joint venture:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>through 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelmond has contingently guaranteed, through 2020, $17.7 million of debt obligations of the joint venture in Peru that operates four hotels. Belmond has also contingently guaranteed the Peru rail joint venture's obligations relating to the performance of its governmental rail concessions, currently in the amount of $7.3 million, through May 2017. The contingent guarantees for each Peruvian joint venture may only be enforced in the event there is a change in control of the relevant joint venture, which would occur only if Belmond's ownership of the economic and voting interests in the joint venture falls below 50%, an event which has not occurred and is not expected to occur.\nContractual Obligations Summary\nThe following table summarizes Belmond's (excluding joint ventures) material known contractual obligations in 2017 and later years as of December 31, 2016, excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt and obligations under capital leases, before deduction of discount on secured term loan and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>839.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest payments have been calculated using the amortization profile of the debt outstanding at December 31, 2016, taking into account the fixed rate paid under interest rate swaps and the prevailing floating rates of interest at the year end.\nAt December 31, 2016, Belmond has a provision of $0.3 million in respect of its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Belmond is unable to estimate with any certainty when, or if, these liabilities will fall due. Accordingly, they are excluded from the contractual obligations table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nBelmond had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2016 other than those involving its equity investees reported in Notes 5, 6 and 24 to the Financial Statements, and those described in commitments and contingencies in Note 19.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preceding discussion and analysis of Belmond's financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Belmond management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, Belmond management evaluates these estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Belmond management believes the following are Belmond's most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nLong-lived assets and goodwill\nBelmond management periodically evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These evaluations include analyses based on the undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying assets, profitability information including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. The determination of fair value incorporates various assumptions and uncertainties, including future cash flows of the business and future growth rates, that Belmond believes are reasonable and supportable but are, however, by their nature, highly judgmental. If the value of the asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, a loss, if any, is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.\nBelmond recorded a non-cash property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Financial Statements for discussion of assumptions used in calculating these charges and sensitivity to changes in these estimates. There were no impairments to property, plant and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2015. Belmond recorded a non-cash property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Belmond's goodwill impairment testing is performed in two steps, first, the determination of impairment based upon the fair value of each reporting unit as compared with its carrying value and, second, if there is an implied impairment, the measurement of the amount of the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is deemed to be impaired and is written down by the extent of the difference. The determination of impairment incorporates various assumptions and uncertainties that Belmond believes are reasonable and supportable considering all available evidence. The determination of future cash flows of the business is based on various assumptions including future ADR and occupancy levels, operating margins and economic and market conditions. Other key assumptions include terminal capitalization rates, future growth rates and the related discount rates, which are affected by assumptions including equity yield, loan to value ratios and amortization terms and interest rates. These assumptions and uncertainties are, by their very nature, highly judgmental. If the assumptions are not met, Belmond may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment losses.\nThere were no impairments to goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2016. Belmond recorded goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Notes 2 and 8 to the Financial Statements for discussion of estimates used in calculating these charges and sensitivity to changes in these estimates. There were no impairments to goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Belmond uses internally developed discounted future cash flow models in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThere were no impairments of other intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for discussion of estimates used in calculating these charges and sensitivity to changes in these estimates.\nDepreciation\nReal estate and other fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight-line method. The depreciation rates on freehold buildings are up to 60 years with a 10% residual value, on trains are up to 75 years, and on machinery and other remaining assets range from 3 to 25 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the respective lease terms including lease extensions that are reasonably assured. Belmond management periodically evaluates useful lives to ensure they remain appropriate and in line with estimated usage.\nIncome Taxes\nBelmond's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and their tax basis. In evaluating Belmond's ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, Belmond considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, Belmond begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates Belmond is using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, Belmond considers three years of cumulative operating income or loss. Belmond maintains a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to reflect the amount, based upon Belmond's estimates that would more likely than not be realized. If Belmond's future operations differed from those in the estimates, Belmond may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance, which could affect its reported results.\nThe calculation of Belmond's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global operations. ASC 740 addresses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Belmond recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and Belmond adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from Belmond's current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\nFair value measurements\nGuidance on fair value measurements and disclosures (i) applies to certain assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis, (ii) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements and (iii) enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.\nGuidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of three categories, namely quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data (Level 2), and unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data (Level 3).\nBelmond reviews its fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes in significant observable valuation inputs identified during these reviews may trigger reclassification of fair value hierarchy levels of financial assets and liabilities. These reclassifications are reported as transfers in Level 3 at their fair values at the beginning of the period in which the change occurs and as transfers out at their fair values at the end of the period.\nThe fair value of Belmond's derivative financial instruments is computed based on an income approach using appropriate valuation techniques including discounting future cash flows and other methods that are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Where credit value adjustments exceeded 20% of the fair value of the derivatives, Level 3 inputs are assumed to have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivatives in their entirety and the valuation has been included in the Level 3 category. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements.\nBelmond uses fair value measurements that are based on observable inputs wherever possible. Its valuation approaches are consistently applied and the assumptions used are reasonable in management's judgment.\nBelmond uses third-party valuation specialists to estimate fair value of some of its financial assets and liabilities. These specialists are primarily used to estimate the fair value for debt and derivatives, as well as for asset valuation. Management performs various reviews and validation procedures prior to utilizing these fair values in Belmond's reporting process. Based on its due diligence discussions with these specialists, Belmond maintains a current understanding of the valuation processes and related assumptions and inputs that these specialists use in developing fair values. If Belmond determines that a fair value provided is outside established parameters, management will further examine the fair value including having follow-up discussions with the specialists. All of these procedures are executed before Belmond uses the valuations in preparing its financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAs of December 31, 2016, Belmond had adopted all relevant accounting guidance, as reported in Note 2 to the Financial Statements. Accounting pronouncements to be adopted are also reported in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial performance and strategic plans of Belmond, which owns and operates hotels and trains around the world. It details the revenue and expenses, as well as the performance metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rates of its various segments. The report also provides comparisons of financial data for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 and explains the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its financials. Overall, the report reveals a focus on driving top- and bottom-line growth, building brand awareness, and positioning for footprint expansion as part of its long-term business strategy.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nBelmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates 45 properties (with two additional properties scheduled for future openings, the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England and the Belmond Andean Explorer train in Peru).\nBelmond has six reportable segments: owned hotels in (1) Europe, (2) North America (including one stand-alone restaurant) and (3) Rest of world, (4) Owned trains and cruises, (5) Part-owned/ managed hotels and (6) Part-owned/ managed trains.\nBelmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company from its part-owned/managed operations. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company's development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation. There has not been a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nHotels represent the largest part of Belmond's business with the vast majority of the Company's revenues in 2016 , 2015 and 2014, respectively, derived primarily from the Europe, North America and Rest of world segments.\nHotels in 2016 consisted of 29 deluxe hotels which were wholly or majority owned by Belmond or, in the case of Belmond Charleston Place, owned by a consolidated variable interest entity. Eleven of the owned hotels are located in Europe, five in North America and thirteen in the rest of the world. In addition, Belmond owns and operates the stand-alone restaurant \u201821' Club in New York which is included within the North America owned hotels segment.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed segment consists of five hotels which Belmond operates under management contracts in Peru and the United States. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in four of the managed hotels.\nIn recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond's portfolio of unique, high-valued properties as part of management's long-term strategy to reduce leverage and redeploy the capital in properties with higher potential returns.\nIn May 2015, Belmond completed the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain. The gain on sale was reported within gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments in the statements of consolidated operations in the relevant periods.\nIn March 2014, Belmond completed the sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, St. Michaels, Maryland. Belmond has continued to manage the hotel for the new owner. Due to Belmond's continuing involvement in managing the hotel, its results, including the gain on sale, are presented within continuing operations.\nBelmond's owned trains and cruises segment consists of five European tourist trains, two river cruise ships in Myanmar and one French canal cruise business. On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced the operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first luxury overnight train to travel throughout the island of Ireland.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed trains segment consists of two train businesses in Southeast Asia and Peru which Belmond operates under management contracts. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in both trains.\nHotel RevPAR, ADR and occupancy\nRevenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available for the period. Same store RevPAR is a comparison of RevPAR based on the operations of the same units in each period, by excluding the effect of any hotel acquisitions in the period or major refurbishment where a property is closed for a full quarter or longer. The comparison also excludes the effect of dispositions (including discontinued operations) or closures. Management uses RevPAR and same store RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenue and to evaluate the performance of a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nAverage daily rate (\"ADR\") is calculated by dividing room revenue by total rooms sold for the period. Management uses ADR to measure the level of pricing achieved by a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotel's available capacity. Management uses occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nADR and RevPAR are measures for a point in time (a day, month or year) and are most often compared across like time periods. Current ADR and RevPAR are not necessarily indicators of future performance.\nIn 2016, same store RevPAR decreased by 1% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 3% in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $490. In 2015, same store RevPAR decreased by 5% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 11% when measured in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $481.\nBusiness strategy\nBelmond plans to grow the business in the long term by:\n \u2022 driving top- and bottom-line growth at the Company's existing businesses \n \u2022 stepping up the Company's efforts to continue to build brand awareness, and \n \u2022 positioning the Company for footprint expansion. \nFor additional information, see \"Management Strategies\" in Item 1 - Business.\nRevenue and expenses\nBelmond derives revenue from owned hotel operations primarily from the sale of rooms and the provision of food and beverages. The main factors for analyzing rooms revenue are the number of room nights sold, or occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR, referred to above which is a measure of both these factors.\nThe revenue from the owned trains and cruises segment primarily comprises tickets sold for travel and food and beverage sales.\nRevenue from part-owned/ managed hotels and trains includes fees received under management contracts, which are typically based upon a combination of a percentage of the revenue from operations and operating earnings calculated before specified fixed charges.\nCost of services includes labor, repairs and maintenance, energy and the costs of food and beverages sold to customers in respect of owned hotels, trains and cruises.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include travel agents' commissions, the salaries and related costs of the sales teams, advertising and public relations costs, and the salaries and related costs of management.\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of owned hotels, trains and cruises.\nImpact of foreign currency exchange rate movements\nAs reported below in the comparisons of the 2016, 2015 and 2014 financial years under Results of Operations\u201d, Belmond has exposure arising from the impact of translating its global foreign currency earnings and expenses into U.S. dollars. Ten of Belmond's owned hotels in 2016 operated in euro territories, two in Brazilian real, one in South African rand, one in British pounds sterling, three in Botswana pula, two in Mexican peso, one in Peruvian nuevo sol, one in Russian ruble and six in various Southeast Asian currencies. Revenue of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Belmond British Pullman, Belmond Northern Belle and Belmond Royal Scotsman trains was primarily in British pounds sterling, but the operating costs of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express were mainly denominated in euros. Revenue derived by Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa, Belmond La Samanna and Belmond Miraflores Park was recorded in U.S. dollars, but the majority of the hotels' expenses were denominated in Mexican pesos, euros and Peruvian nuevo soles, respectively. Both revenue and the majority of expenses for Belmond Governor's Residence and Belmond La R\u00e9sidence D'Angkor were recorded in U.S. dollars.\nExcept for the specific instances described above, Belmond's properties match foreign currency earnings and costs as far as possible to provide a natural hedge against currency movements. The reporting of Belmond's revenue and costs translated into U.S. dollars, however, can be materially affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations from period to period.\nConstant currency\nBelmond analyzes certain key financial measures on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Measurement on a constant currency basis means the results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year exchange rates.\nMarket capitalization\nThe Company's class A common share price increased during 2016 to $13.35 at December 31, 2016, from $9.50 at December 31, 2015 and Belmond's market capitalization increased to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2016, from $0.96 billion at December 31, 2015.\nResults of Operations\nBelmond's operating results for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, expressed as a percentage of revenue, are as follows:\n\nOperating information for Belmond's owned hotels for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\n\n2016 compared to 2015\n\nThe same store RevPAR data for 2016 and 2015 excludes the operations of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, which was closed for refurbishment from January through November 2015, and Belmond La Residence d'Angkor, which closed for refurbishment in May 2016 and re-opened in November 2016. Both of these operations are included in the Rest of world segment.\n2015 compared to 2014\n\nThe same store RevPAR data for 2015 and 2014 exclude the operations of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond (included in the North America segment), Belmond Miraflores Park and Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, one of the safari camps in Belmond Safaris (both included in the Rest of world segment) as these properties did not operate during one of the periods presented.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015 and year ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014\nOverview\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $36.3 million ($0.36 per common share) on revenue of $549.8 million, compared with a net earnings of $16.3 million ($0.16 per common share) on revenue of $551.4 million in the prior year. The increase in net earnings was partially due to an increase in earnings of $6.6 million from the Company's PeruRail joint venture which commenced transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine. This was complemented by an increase in earnings at Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and the reopening of the Belmond Eagle Island Lodge as well as strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. These increases were partially offset by the gain on sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in Madrid of $19.7 million which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 which did not reoccur. In addition, the Company benefited from a decrease in central costs due to lower legal and professional fees and payroll savings related to a weaker British pound than in the prior-year. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million ($1.0 million impairment charge of property, plant and equipment related in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the company benefited from a foreign exchange gain of $9.2 million that was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $16.3 million ($0.16 per common share) on revenue of $551.4 million, compared with net loss of $1.9 million ($0.02 per common share) on revenue of $585.7 million in the prior year. The net earnings in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to the $20.3 million gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments, largely as a result of the May 2015 sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, compared with a $4.1 million gain recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.5 million, which did not reoccur in the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, there was a $9.8 million impairment charge and foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with a $1.2 million impairment charge and a foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue \n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $549.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million, from $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total owned hotels revenue was $475.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.8 million, or 1%, from $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total owned hotels revenue was largely due to a revenue increase of $5.0 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace due to the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and a revenue increase of $3.1 million in Belmond Safaris, Botswana, following the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge which was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. This was offset by a revenue decrease of $4.9 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Venice, Italy due to a challenging comparable period, with revenue in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Revenue from total owned trains and cruises was $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 9%, from $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of a combined revenue decline of $1.2 million at the Company's two river cruises in Myanmar and a fall in revenue of $4.3 million at the Company's European trains due to the year-over-year depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. This was slightly offset by revenue growth of $1.7 million at Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $34.3 million, or 6%, from $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total owned hotels revenue was $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 5%, from $498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in total hotels revenue was principally attributable to a $37.6 million and $25.7 million fall in revenue at the Company's European and Brazilian hotels due to unfavorable exchange rate movements, partially offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $24.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Revenue from owned trains and cruises was $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $8.8 million, or 12%, from $74.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of revenue declines at the Company's two river cruise ships in Myanmar and Belmond Northern Belle.\nOwned hotels - Europe \n\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million from $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to a revenue decrease of $4.9 million or 13% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani partially due to a challenging comparative period, with revenue for 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Partially offsetting this decline, Belmond Reid's Palace increased revenue by $2.5 million due to a 18% increase in occupancy, which largely resulted from the Company's strategic decision to focus on driving wholesale business in order to gain market share during the destination's slow season. In addition, revenue for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $3.0 million over the prior-year period mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a reduction in rates in Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons and Belmond Grand Hotel Europe. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment decreased to $676 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $689 in the year ended December 31, 2015. Occupancy increased to 64% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 62% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Same store RevPAR increased by 2% in U.S. dollars, to $435 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $427 in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 4% on a constant currency basis.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $12.7 million, or 6%, from $212.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was attributable to unfavorable exchange rate movements which contributed to $37.6 million of the revenue decline, following the 37%, 16% and 7% year-over-year depreciation of the Russian ruble, euro and British pound, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. This was partially offset by revenue growth of $24.9 million on a constant currency basis at the Company's European hotels. The Italian properties were responsible for $15.0 million of this growth, having achieved a 10% increase in constant currency ADR and a 4 percentage-point increase in occupancy. Additionally, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe recorded an increase in revenue of $5.2 million on a constant currency basis, having benefited from increased local and foreign demand and food and beverage growth with the opening of the new Azia\u201d restaurant. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment decreased to $689 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $783 in the year ended December 31, 2014. Occupancy increased to 62% in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 56% in the year ended December 31, 2014. Same store RevPAR decreased by 3% in U.S. dollars, to $427 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $439 in the year ended December 31, 2014, but increased by 19% on a constant currency basis.\nOwned hotels - North America\n\n\n\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $145.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 1%, from $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was largely attributable to a $1.9 million revenue decline at Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa and a $1.2 million decline in revenue at \u201821' Club by Belmond. Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa was impacted by increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area of Mexico. \u201821' Club by Belmond was negatively impacted by volatility in stock markets as well as disruption caused by neighboring construction noise. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 million revenue increase at Belmond Charleston Place. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product following the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015. ADR for the North American owned hotels segment decreased to $421 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $429 in the year ended December 31, 2015. Occupancy remained flat at 67% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Same store RevPAR decreased by 3% to $281 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $289 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.5 million, or 4%, from $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This revenue increase was led by a $2.8 million growth at Belmond El Encanto as it continued to benefit from its second full year of operations. In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in revenue at Belmond Charleston Place, following increased occupancy and strong ADR growth as a result of the hotel's renovated room product. Revenue increases of $1.6 million in the other North American owned hotels were offset by the March 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, which had generated revenues of $1.3 million", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nBelmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates 45 properties (with two additional properties scheduled for future openings, the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England and the Belmond Andean Explorer train in Peru).\nBelmond has six reportable segments: owned hotels in (1) Europe, (2) North America (including one stand-alone restaurant) and (3) Rest of world, (4) Owned trains and cruises, (5) Part-owned/ managed hotels and (6) Part-owned/ managed trains.\nBelmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company from its part-owned/managed operations. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company's development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation. There has not been a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nHotels represent the largest part of Belmond's business with the vast majority of the Company's revenues in 2016 , 2015 and 2014, respectively, derived primarily from the Europe, North America and Rest of world segments.\nHotels in 2016 consisted of 29 deluxe hotels which were wholly or majority owned by Belmond or, in the case of Belmond Charleston Place, owned by a consolidated variable interest entity. Eleven of the owned hotels are located in Europe, five in North America and thirteen in the rest of the world. In addition, Belmond owns and operates the stand-alone restaurant \u201821' Club in New York which is included within the North America owned hotels segment.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed segment consists of five hotels which Belmond operates under management contracts in Peru and the United States. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in four of the managed hotels.\nIn recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond's portfolio of unique, high-valued properties as part of management's long-term strategy to reduce leverage and redeploy the capital in properties with higher potential returns.\nIn May 2015, Belmond completed the sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain. The gain on sale was reported within gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments in the statements of consolidated operations in the relevant periods.\nIn March 2014, Belmond completed the sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, St. Michaels, Maryland. Belmond has continued to manage the hotel for the new owner. Due to Belmond's continuing involvement in managing the hotel, its results, including the gain on sale, are presented within continuing operations.\nBelmond's owned trains and cruises segment consists of five European tourist trains, two river cruise ships in Myanmar and one French canal cruise business. On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced the operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first luxury overnight train to travel throughout the island of Ireland.\nBelmond's part-owned/ managed trains segment consists of two train businesses in Southeast Asia and Peru which Belmond operates under management contracts. Belmond has unconsolidated equity interests in both trains.\nHotel RevPAR, ADR and occupancy\nRevenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available for the period. Same store RevPAR is a comparison of RevPAR based on the operations of the same units in each period, by excluding the effect of any hotel acquisitions in the period or major refurbishment where a property is closed for a full quarter or longer. The comparison also excludes the effect of dispositions (including discontinued operations) or closures. Management uses RevPAR and same store RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenue and to evaluate the performance of a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nAverage daily rate (\"ADR\") is calculated by dividing room revenue by total rooms sold for the period. Management uses ADR to measure the level of pricing achieved by a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotel's available capacity. Management uses occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period.\nADR and RevPAR are measures for a point in time (a day, month or year) and are most often compared across like time periods. Current ADR and RevPAR are not necessarily indicators of future performance.\nIn 2016, same store RevPAR decreased by 1% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 3% in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $490. In 2015, same store RevPAR decreased by 5% in U.S. dollars, but increased by 11% when measured in constant currency. Average occupancy was 61% and ADR was $481.\nBusiness strategy\nBelmond plans to grow the business in the long term by:\n \u2022 driving top- and bottom-line growth at the Company's existing businesses \n \u2022 stepping up the Company's efforts to continue to build brand awareness, and \n \u2022 positioning the Company for footprint expansion. \nFor additional information, see \"Management Strategies\" in Item 1 - Business.\nRevenue and expenses\nBelmond derives revenue from owned hotel operations primarily from the sale of rooms and the provision of food and beverages.

Ten of Belmond's owned hotels in 2016 operated in euro territories, two in Brazilian real, one in South African rand, one in British pounds sterling, three in Botswana pula, two in Mexican peso, one in Peruvian nuevo sol, one in Russian ruble and six in various Southeast Asian currencies. Revenue of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Belmond British Pullman, Belmond Northern Belle and Belmond Royal Scotsman trains was primarily in British pounds sterling, but the operating costs of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express were mainly denominated in euros. Revenue derived by Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa, Belmond La Samanna and Belmond Miraflores Park was recorded in U.S. dollars, but the majority of the hotels' expenses were denominated in Mexican pesos, euros and Peruvian nuevo soles, respectively. Both revenue and the majority of expenses for Belmond Governor's Residence and Belmond La R\u00e9sidence D'Angkor were recorded in U.S. dollars.\nExcept for the specific instances described above, Belmond's properties match foreign currency earnings and costs as far as possible to provide a natural hedge against currency movements.

increased to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2016, from $0.96 billion at December 31, 2015.\nResults of Operations\nBelmond's operating results for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, expressed as a

The increase in net earnings was partially due to an increase in earnings of $6.6 million from the Company's PeruRail joint venture which commenced transport of copper concentrate from the Las Bambas mine. This was complemented by an increase in earnings at Belmond Copacabana Palace as a result of the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and the reopening of the Belmond Eagle Island Lodge as well as strong year-over-year growth for the remaining hotels in Europe. These increases were partially offset by the gain on sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond in Madrid of $19.7 million which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 which did not reoccur. In addition, the Company benefited from a decrease in central costs due to lower legal and professional fees and payroll savings related to a weaker British pound than in the prior-year. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million ($1.0 million impairment charge of property, plant and equipment related in the year ended December 31, 2016). In addition, the company benefited from a foreign exchange gain of $9.2 million that was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $16.3 million ($0.16 per common share) on revenue of $551.4 million, compared with net loss of $1.9 million ($0.02 per common share) on revenue of $585.7 million in the prior year. The net earnings in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to the $20.3 million gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and equity method investments, largely as a result of the May 2015 sale of Hotel Ritz by Belmond, compared with a $4.1 million gain recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.5 million, which did not reoccur in the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, there was a $9.8 million impairment charge and foreign exchange loss of $5.0 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with a $1.2 million impairment charge and a foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue Table 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ millions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned hotels:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of world\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>475.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned trains & cruises\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Part-owned/managed hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Part-owned/managed trains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total part-owned/managed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $549.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million, from $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total owned hotels revenue was $475.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.8 million, or 1%, from $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total owned hotels revenue was largely due to a revenue increase of $5.0 million at Belmond Copacabana Palace due to the 2016 Olympic Games that took place in Rio de Janeiro and a revenue increase of $3.1 million in Belmond Safaris, Botswana, following the reopening of Belmond Eagle Island Lodge which was closed from January to November 2015 for a complete renovation. This was offset by a revenue decrease of $4.9 million at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Venice, Italy due to a challenging comparable period, with revenue in 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Revenue from total owned trains and cruises was $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 9%, from $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of a combined revenue decline of $1.2 million at the Company's two river cruises in Myanmar and a fall in revenue of $4.3 million at the Company's European trains due to the year-over-year depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. This was slightly offset by revenue growth of $1.7 million at Belmond Grand Hibernian, which commenced operations on August 30, 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $34.3 million, or 6%, from $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total owned hotels revenue was $472.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 5%, from $498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in total hotels revenue was principally attributable to a $37.6 million and $25.7 million fall in revenue at the Company's European and Brazilian hotels due to unfavorable exchange rate movements, partially offset by growth on a constant currency basis of $24.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Revenue from owned trains and cruises was $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $8.8 million, or 12%, from $74.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of revenue declines at the Company's two river cruise ships in Myanmar and Belmond Northern Belle.\nOwned hotels - Europe Table 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rooms Available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rooms Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy (percentage)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average daily rate (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store RevPAR (in U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nRevenue was $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million from $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to a revenue decrease of $4.9 million or 13% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani partially due to a challenging comparative period, with revenue for 2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other year, as did the World Expo 2015 in Milan, both of which generated increased visitation to Venice. Partially offsetting this decline, Belmond Reid's Palace increased revenue by $2.5 million due to a 18% increase in occupancy, which largely resulted from the Company's strategic decision to focus on driving wholesale business in order to gain market share during the destination's slow season. In addition, revenue for the Italian hotels excluding Belmond Hotel Cipriani was up $3.0 million over the prior-year period mainly as a result of leveraging strong demand to drive higher rates. This was offset by a reduction in rates in Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons and Belmond Grand Hotel Europe. ADR in U.S. dollar terms for the European owned hotels segment decreased to $676 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $689 in the year ended December 31, 2015.

This decrease was attributable to unfavorable exchange rate movements which contributed to $37.6 million of the revenue decline, following the 37%, 16% and 7% year-over-year depreciation of the Russian ruble, euro and British pound, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. This was partially offset by revenue growth of $24.9 million on a constant currency basis at the Company's European hotels. The Italian properties were responsible for $15.0 million of this growth, having achieved a 10% increase in constant currency ADR and a 4 percentage-point increase in occupancy. Additionally, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe recorded an increase in revenue of $5.2 million on a constant currency basis, having benefited from increased local and foreign demand and food and beverage growth with the opening of the new Azia\u201d restaurant.

This decrease was largely attributable to a $1.9 million revenue decline at Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa and a $1.2 million decline in revenue at \u201821' Club by Belmond. Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa was impacted by increased local competition and the re-opening of renovated hotels in the Los Cabos resort area of Mexico. \u201821' Club by Belmond was negatively impacted by volatility in stock markets as well as disruption caused by neighboring construction noise. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 million revenue increase at Belmond Charleston Place. The hotel increased food and beverage revenue largely as a result of a new high-end sports pub that commenced operations in July 2016 and also continued to benefit from improved room product following the Company's three-year rooms renovation project that was completed in December 2015. ADR for the North American owned hotels segment decreased to $421 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $429 in the year ended December 31, 2015. Occupancy remained flat at 67% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Same store RevPAR decreased by 3% to $281 in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $289 in the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenue was $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.5 million, or 4%, from $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This revenue increase was led by a $2.8 million growth at Belmond El Encanto as it continued to benefit from its second full year of operations. In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in revenue at Belmond Charleston Place, following increased occupancy and strong ADR growth as a result of the hotel's renovated room product. Revenue increases of $1.6 million in the other North American owned hotels were offset by the March 2014 sale of Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, which had generated revenues of $1.3 million"}
