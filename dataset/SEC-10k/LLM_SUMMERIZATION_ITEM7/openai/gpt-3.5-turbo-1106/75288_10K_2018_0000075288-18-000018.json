Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2017, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2017, 97% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama product sales in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection, like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, including Marlin Bars, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers. Additionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 19% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands generally include various specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S. and foreign-based apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe disposal of discontinued, end of season or excess inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business, and our operating groups have historically utilized a variety of methods to sell such inventory, including outlet stores in Tommy Bahama, e-commerce flash sales on our various e-commerce websites, and off-price retailers. Our focus in disposing of the excess inventory for our lifestyle brands is to do so in a brand appropriate setting and achieve an acceptable margin.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe the changes in consumer preferences for discretionary spending, the current global economic conditions and economic uncertainty continue to impact the business of each of our operating groups, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers may have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence of the evolution is apparent with weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. These changes may require that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, differently than historical practices.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long-term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable store sales. We also believe growth can be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations for additional stores.\nWe believe our lifestyle brands have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long-term. However, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 16% in Fiscal 2016. As a result, this management of our wholesale distribution for our lifestyle brands is likely to result in lower wholesale sales in Fiscal 2018, as well as in the near-term future, as we may reduce the amount of sales to certain wholesale accounts by reducing the number of doors that carry our product, reducing the volume sold for a particular door or exiting the account altogether. We anticipate that sales increases in our wholesale businesses in the long-term will stem primarily from current customers adding within their existing door count and increasing their online business; increased sales to online retailers; and our selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting and who present and merchandise our products in a way that is consistent with our full-price, direct to consumer distribution strategy. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs and licenses.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and restaurant build-out for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate increased advertising, employment and other costs to support ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth. Fiscal 2018 advertising expense is expected to increase for each of our brands with a focus on new consumer acquisition as well as consumer retention and engagement.\nIn the midst of the changes in our industry, an important initiative for us in Fiscal 2017 was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focused on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses. In Fiscal 2017, we made progress with these initiatives and expect to make additional progress in Fiscal 2018.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria. With the evolving fashion\nretail environment, our interest in acquiring smaller brands and earlier stage companies is evolving, particularly where we may have the opportunity to more fully integrate the brand into our existing infrastructure and shared services functions.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016: Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher net earnings in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to (1) a lower effective tax rate primarily resulting from U.S. Tax Reform as discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, (2) higher operating income in Tommy Bahama and (3) improved operating results in Southern Tide, which included certain purchase accounting charges in Fiscal 2016 and was not owned for the full year in Fiscal 2016. These items were partially offset by (1) the impact of LIFO accounting on Corporate and Other operating results, (2) lower operating income in Lilly Pulitzer, due in part to charges associated with the Fiscal 2017 acquisition of certain Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store operations, and (3) lower operating income in Lanier Apparel.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO accounting adjustments for inventory, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center and Beaufort Bonnet, which are not included in our operating groups. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales in our comparable store sales disclosures is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel or other event resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening, or other event. A store that is remodeled will generally continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for longer than a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year because the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we expect to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales. We have calculated all percentages based on actual data, but percentage columns may not add due to rounding. Individual line items of our consolidated statements of operations may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as classification of certain expenses may vary by company.

The increase in consolidated net sales was driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $20.9 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and the Southern Tide e-commerce operations, which we acquired in April 2016, (2) an $18.5 million, or 4% increase in comparable store sales to $444.7 million in Fiscal 2017 from $426.1 million in Fiscal 2016, (3) a net $17.7 million aggregate increase in wholesale sales, primarily consisting of higher sales in Southern Tide, which we acquired in April 2016, Lanier Apparel, Tommy Bahama and Corporate and Other partially offset by a decrease in Lilly Pulitzer and (4) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels consisting of lower sales in Tommy Bahama and higher sales in Lilly Pulitzer. We estimate that the 53rd week in Fiscal 2017 provided an approximate $17 million benefit to our consolidated net sales. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, comparable store sales increased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic and the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits, continue to impact the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $27.1 million, or 4.1%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of (1) a $20.5 million, or 6%, increase in comparable store sales to $340.0 million in Fiscal 2017 from $319.5 million in Fiscal 2016, (2) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales reflecting sales from a restaurant that opened in Fiscal 2017, a Marlin Bar that opened in late Fiscal 2016 and increased sales at existing restaurants, (3) an incremental net sales increase of $5.4 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and (4) a $2.6 million increase in wholesale sales reflecting higher off-price sales, as Tommy Bahama sold excess prior season inventory, partially offset by lower full-price wholesale sales, as Tommy Bahama continued to manage its exposure to department stores. These increases were partially offset by $11.0 million of lower sales in our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily resulting from the absence of any e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to $8.9 million of e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2016, as well as lower sales in existing outlet stores. Tommy Bahama's direct to consumer sales benefited from (1) increased marketing and advertising including substantial Spring 2017 and Holiday 2017 catalogs, which both presented the wide breadth of Tommy Bahama products in one place, (2) increased sales from its semiannual Friends & Family events held each year, (3) increased sales from Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card and Flip Side events held in the second quarter and fourth quarter of each year and (4) Tommy Bahama taking initial markdowns on select items at the end of the selling season in our retail stores and on our e-commerce website in Fiscal 2017 after initiating that approach in January 2017. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Tommy Bahama comparable store sales increased 5% in Fiscal 2017. We expect full-price and off-price wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama to decrease in Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 amounts.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 166 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 110 full-price retail stores, 18 restaurant-retail locations and 38 outlet stores. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 restaurant-retail locations and 40 outlet stores.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $15.6 million, or 6.7%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $13.8 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) an $8.0 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales increases were partially offset by (1) a $4.2 million decrease in wholesale sales and (2) a $1.9 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $104.7 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to $106.6 million in Fiscal 2016, with negative retail comparable store sales offsetting positive e-commerce comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store sales primarily reflects reduced retail store traffic while the lower wholesale sales were a result of lower sales to department stores, as Lilly Pulitzer continues to manage its exposure to department stores, and the result of the acquisition of 12 Signature Stores in Fiscal 2017. We expect wholesale sales in Lilly Pulitzer will be lower in Fiscal 2018 than Fiscal 2017 due to this acquisition of 12 Signature Stores and the continued management of department store exposure. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Lilly Pulitzer comparable store sales decreased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 57 Lilly Pulitzer retail stores, compared to 40 retail stores as of January 28, 2017. During Fiscal 2017, Lilly Pulitzer opened six new Lilly Pulitzer stores, acquired 12 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores and closed one store.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and warehouse sales\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $6.1 million, or 6.1%, was primarily due to increased sales in various programs, including initial shipments in some programs, as well as sales associated with the Strong Suit and Duck Head businesses, which were acquired in Fiscal 2016. These sales increases were partially offset by lower sales in other programs resulting from reductions in volume and the exit from various programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe increase in net sales of $13.5 million for Southern Tide in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to Fiscal 2017 including a full year of operations, while Fiscal 2016 only included the operations from the date of our acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. Therefore, net sales for Fiscal 2016 excluded much of the Spring 2016 wholesale shipments.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Southern Tide for each period presented:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers and Beaufort Bonnet, which was acquired in December 2017, as well as the impact of the elimination of any intercompany sales between our operating groups.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, as well as the change between those two periods.

These items were partially offset by (1) the $13.7 million net unfavorable impact of LIFO accounting and (2) Lilly Pulitzer including an inventory step-up charge of $1.0 million in Fiscal 2017. We estimate that the 53rd week in Fiscal 2017 resulted in approximately $9 million of additional gross profit. Changes in gross margin by operating group are discussed below.

These items were partially offset by (1) Fiscal 2017 including increased off-price wholesale sales, including the sale of the aged inventory which was marked down in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016 at a nominal gross profit, and (2) the gross margin impact of an increasing proportion of sales in our direct to consumer business occurring during our periodic loyalty award card, Flip Side and Friends and Family marketing events, which typically have lower gross margins than sales during other periods.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe decrease in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer was due to Fiscal 2017 including $1.0 million of incremental cost of goods sold related to the step-up of inventory associated with the acquisition of certain Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores. The impact of the step-up of inventory was partially offset by the impact of a change in sales mix towards direct to consumer sales and improved gross margins for off-price e-commerce flash clearance and wholesale sales in Fiscal 2017.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel for Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower customer allowance and inventory markdown amounts due, in part, to the exit from certain programs resulting in the reversal of previously recognized amounts and a change in sales mix as branded sales represented a greater proportion of Lanier Apparel sales in Fiscal 2017.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe increase in gross margin for Southern Tide in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the gross profit of Southern Tide for Fiscal 2016 including $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold associated with the step-up of inventory recognized at acquisition. All amounts related to the step-up of inventory were recognized during Fiscal 2016. Additionally, Southern Tide's gross margin during Fiscal 2017 reflects a change in sales mix with a greater proportion of wholesale sales and off-price sales partially offset by reductions in product costs. Wholesale sales, which typically have a lower gross margin than e-commerce sales, represented a greater proportion of Southern Tide in Fiscal 2017, primarily due to seasonality as Fiscal 2016 did not include a full year of operations, while off-price sales increased in Fiscal 2017 as Southern Tide focused on moving excess and prior season inventory.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center and Beaufort Bonnet operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of any intercompany sales between our operating groups. The primary driver for the lower gross profit was the unfavorable impact of a $7.8 million LIFO accounting charge in Fiscal 2017 compared to a $5.9 million LIFO accounting credit in Fiscal 2016. The LIFO accounting charge in Corporate and Other in Fiscal 2017 primarily results from the sale of inventory that had been marked down to net realizable value in prior periods in the operating groups, but generally reversed in Corporate and Other as part of LIFO accounting as well as a change in the LIFO reserve resulting from increases in the PPI as published by the United States Department of Labor. The LIFO accounting credit in Corporate and Other in Fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from the reversal of inventory markdowns to estimated net realizable value recognized in the operating groups during Fiscal 2016.\nSG&A\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A (as a % of net sales)\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Tommy Bahama associated with Tommy Bahama Canada acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Lilly Pulitzer associated with Signature Store acquisitions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction/integration costs associated with Signature Store acquisitions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution center integration charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) a $12.6 million increase in incentive compensation, reflecting higher incentive compensation amounts in Tommy Bahama, Corporate and Other and Lanier Apparel, partially offset by lower incentive compensation amounts in Lilly Pulitzer, (2) $11.6 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2017 associated with additional retail stores and restaurants, (3) increased advertising expense for our brands, (4) other infrastructure and employment cost increases related to expanding certain of our business operations and (5) $3.9 million of incremental SG&A in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2017 associated with the Southern Tide business, which was acquired in April 2016.

This change results in the income tax amounts and effective tax rates for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 not being comparable. Additionally, Fiscal 2017 includes the favorable impact of (1) the blended tax rate for Fiscal 2017 resulting from the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform, (2) improved operating results in certain of our foreign jurisdictions, including foreign sourcing operations, which have lower tax rates than our domestic earnings, and (3) $0.8 million of favorable discrete items in Fiscal 2017 primarily related to certain prior year tax items, which were offset by the $0.8 million unfavorable impact of certain stock awards that vested during the First Quarter of Fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 includes the favorable impact of (1) earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates than our domestic earnings, (2) the utilization of certain foreign operating loss carryforward amounts and (3) the reversal of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances related to our ability to realize those net operating loss carryforwards in future periods. Refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information about income taxes.\nAs a result of U.S. Tax Reform which reduced the corporate tax rate on United States operations from 35% to 21%, our effective tax rates for historical periods are not indicative of anticipated effective tax rates for future periods. Our effective tax rate for the full year of Fiscal 2018 is expected to be approximately 26%. However, in addition to the typical items that may result in an effective tax rate that differs from our expectations, the effective rate for Fiscal 2018 may vary from 26% as our Fiscal 2017 statement of operations includes provisional amounts for U.S. Tax Reform and any adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized for U.S. Tax Reform will be recognized in Fiscal 2018. The final impact of U.S. Tax Reform may differ from our provisional amounts recognized in Fiscal 2017 due to additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, us obtaining additional information to refine our estimated tax amounts and changes in current interpretations and assumptions.\nNet earnings from continuing operations\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n</td> <td>16,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher net earnings in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to (1) a lower effective tax rate primarily resulting from the impact of U.S. Tax Reform as discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, (2) higher operating income in Tommy Bahama and (3) improved operating results in Southern Tide, which included certain purchase accounting charges in Fiscal 2016 and was not owned for the full year in Fiscal 2016. These items were partially offset by (1) the impact of LIFO accounting on Corporate and Other operating results, (2) lower operating income in Lilly Pulitzer, due in part to charges associated with the Fiscal 2017 acquisition of certain Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store operations, and (3) lower operating income in Lanier Apparel.\nDiscontinued operations\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a reduction in the retained lease obligations liability of our discontinued operations. This resulted from negotiated settlements in respect of the retained lease obligations for an amount in the aggregate less than the previously recognized lease obligations liability. The loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in Fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from an additional loss related to the retained lease obligations liability of our discontinued operations due to an updated assessment of the anticipated losses considering anticipated sub-lease income to be earned, timing of obtaining a tenant, lease incentives and market rents.

The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily driven by (1) the $27.4 million of net sales of Southern Tide, which was acquired on April 19, 2016, (2) an incremental net sales increase of $20.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, (3) a $7.0 million net increase in direct to consumer clearance sales reflecting an increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales at Lilly Pulitzer and decreases in outlet store sales at Tommy Bahama and (4) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These sales increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $404.1 million in Fiscal 2016 from $410.6 million in Fiscal 2015 reflecting a decrease in comparable store sales at Tommy Bahama of 3% and an increase in comparable store sales at Lilly Pulitzer of 2%. We believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic, the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits and the 2016 election cycle, impacted the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses in Fiscal 2016. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $0.4 million, or 0.1%, was primarily driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $12.4 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) a $5.4 million increase in restaurant sales primarily resulting from the impact of a full year of operations of the Waikiki restaurant in Fiscal 2016 and a modest increase at restaurants open for the full year of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were offset by (1) a $8.8 million, or 3%, decrease in comparable store sales to $302.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $311.3 million in Fiscal 2015, (2) a $3.6 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily reflecting a decrease in sales in existing outlet stores, and (3) a $5.2 million decrease in wholesale sales. The decreases in the direct to consumer channels were primarily due to lower traffic in both our full-price retail stores and outlet stores. The decrease in wholesale sales reflects lower full-price wholesale sales reflecting the challenging environment of our wholesale department store and specialty store accounts.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 retail-restaurant locations and 40 outlet stores. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 164 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 107 full-price retail stores, 16 retail-restaurant locations and 41 outlet stores.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $28.7 million, or 14.0%, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $11.2 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores, (2) a $10.7 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales, (3) an $8.2 million increase in wholesale sales primarily resulting from increased orders from existing wholesale customers and (4) a $2.2 million, or 2%, increase in comparable store sales to $101.5 million in Fiscal 2016 compared to $99.3 million in Fiscal 2015. These sales increases were partially offset by a net $3.8 million decrease in warehouse sales as Lilly Pulitzer did not anniversary its June warehouse sale in Fiscal 2016. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 40 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, after opening six new stores, acquiring one former Signature Store and closing one store during Fiscal 2016, compared to 34 full-price retail stores as of January 30, 2016.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and warehouse sales\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLanier Apparel:\nThe decrease in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $4.4 million, or 4.1%, was primarily due to lower sales of $6.5 million in the tailored clothing business partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in the sportswear business. The decreased sales in the tailored clothing business was primarily due to lower sales in certain programs including reductions in volume, shifts of timing and exits from various programs. These reductions in volume were partially offset by initial shipments and volume increases in other programs. The increased sales in the sportswear business were primarily due to increased volumes in private label sportswear programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe net sales of Southern Tide reflect the sales of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. During the period from April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, 77% of Southern Tide's net sales were wholesale sales with the remainder of the sales consisting of e-commerce sales.\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers as well as the impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups. Net sales in Fiscal 2015 included the unfavorable impact of the elimination of intercompany sales between our operating groups with no meaningful impact of intercompany sales between our operating groups in Fiscal 2016.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>145,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>29,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>7,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO (credit) charge included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory step-up charge included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily due to higher net sales, as discussed above, and the net favorable impact of LIFO accounting.

The inventory markdowns primarily resulted from a change in Tommy Bahama's approach to inventory clearance; starting in January 2017, Tommy Bahama began clearing certain prior season inventory by taking initial markdowns on certain product categories in its full-price retail stores and then clearing any remaining inventory through both its outlet stores and third party off-price retailers and by operating the outlet stores with lower inventory levels and with better merchandised assortments.\nThe lower gross margins in the direct to consumer channel primarily reflect lower gross margins in outlet store and e-commerce flash clearance sales which were primarily due to our efforts to drive traffic in our outlet stores, reduce inventory levels and dispose of prior season inventory during Fiscal 2016. The higher discounting in our off-price direct to consumer channel was focused on women's, home and other products as well as footwear, which we transitioned to a third party licensee. Full-price retail store and e-commerce gross margins were also lower primarily due to a greater proportion of sales in Fiscal 2016 occurring in connection with our loyalty award card, Flip Side and Friends & Family marketing events, which typically have lower gross margins than sales during non-promotional periods, and the impact of Tommy Bahama discounting certain end-of-season women, home and other product in store and online beginning in January 2017. The decrease in gross margin in the wholesale distribution channel was primarily due to a change in sales mix with off-price sales representing a greater proportion of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2016.\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe decrease in gross margin for Lilly Pulitzer in Fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the change in sales mix as e-commerce flash clearance sales represented a greater proportion of sales during Fiscal 2016 and in-store markdowns were more significant in Fiscal 2016.\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in gross margin for Lanier Apparel was primarily due to the net favorable impact of in-stock program allowances and inventory markdowns in Fiscal 2016 as compared to Fiscal 2015.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe gross profit of Southern Tide for Fiscal 2016 includes the gross profit of Southern Tide for the period from the date of acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017, which was impacted by $2.7 million of incremental cost of goods sold associated with the step-up of inventory recognized at acquisition. Therefore, we do not consider the gross profit or gross margin for this period to be indicative of expected gross profit, or gross margin, for future periods. All amounts related to the step-up of inventory were recognized during Fiscal 2016.\nCorporate and Other:\nThe gross profit in Corporate and Other in each period primarily reflects (1) the gross profit of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, (2) the impact of LIFO accounting adjustments and (3) the impact of certain consolidating adjustments, including the elimination of any intercompany sales between our operating groups. The primary driver for the higher gross profit was due to Fiscal 2016 including the favorable impact of a LIFO accounting credit of $5.9 million with no\nsignificant impact of LIFO accounting in Fiscal 2015. The LIFO accounting credit in Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the LIFO accounting reversal of the significant inventory markdowns recognized in Tommy Bahama during Fiscal 2016.\nSG&A\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A (as a % of net sales)\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>48.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Tommy Bahama associated with Tommy Bahama Canada acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets included in Southern Tide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition included in Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution center integration charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to (1) $16.9 million of incremental costs in Fiscal 2016 associated with additional Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores and restaurants and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, (2) $11.4 million of SG&A associated with Southern Tide, including amortization of intangible assets and distribution center integration costs, (3) an increase in brand advertising, marketing and other expenses in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer to increase brand awareness and provide support for the brands, (4) increased depreciation expense of $2.2 million related to e-commerce operations and inventory/order management systems in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer that were implemented in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, (5) asset impairment charges of $1.9 million primarily related to three outlet store closings and certain information technology assets, (6) an increase in severance expenses of $1.5 million and (6) $0.8 million of transaction expenses associated with the Southern Tide acquisition, which are included in Corporate and Other. These SG&A increases were partially offset by $8.0 million of lower incentive compensation, with decreases in each operating group as well as Corporate and Other.\nSG&A included amortization of intangible assets of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2016 and $2.0 million in Fiscal 2015 with the increase primarily due to amortization related to the Southern Tide intangible assets. We anticipate that amortization of intangible assets for Fiscal 2017 will be approximately $2.2 million.\nRoyalties and other operating income\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalties and other operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalties and other operating income in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflects income received from third parties from the licensing of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands.

Fiscal 2015 reflects the loss on the sale of our former Ben Sherman business, which was sold in the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015, as well as the operations of the discontinued operations prior to disposal and any charges related to the discontinued operations subsequent to disposal.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary source of revenue and cash flow is through our design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of branded apparel products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands, and private label apparel products. Our primary uses of cash flow include the purchase of products in the operation of our business from third party contract manufacturers outside of the United States, as well as operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, occupancy-related costs, marketing and advertising costs, distribution costs, other general and administrative expenses and the payment of periodic interest payments related to our financing arrangements.\nAdditionally, we use cash for the funding of capital expenditures, dividends and repayment of indebtedness. In the ordinary course of business, we maintain certain levels of inventory, extend credit to our wholesale customers and pay our operating\nexpenses. Thus, we require a certain amount of working capital to operate our business. If cash inflows are less than cash outflows, we have access to amounts under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to its terms, which is described below. We may seek to finance our future cash requirements through various methods, including cash flow from operations, borrowings under our current or additional credit facilities, sales of debt or equity securities, and cash on hand.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we had $6.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, with $45.8 million of borrowings outstanding and $219.7 million of availability under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. We believe our balance sheet and anticipated future positive cash flow from operating activities provide sufficient cash flow to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements as well as ample opportunity to continue to invest in our brands, direct to consumer initiatives and other strategic initiatives.\nKey Liquidity Measures\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>February 3, 2018\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Liabilities\n</td> <td>135,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital ratio\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt to total capital ratio\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. Current assets increased from January 28, 2017 to February 3, 2018 primarily due to higher receivables and prepaid expenses partially offset by lower inventories. Current liabilities increased from January 28, 2017 to February 3, 2018 primarily due to higher accrued compensation and other accrued expenses and liabilities partially offset by lower accounts payable. Changes in current assets and current liabilities are discussed below.\nFor the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term debt, and total capital is defined as debt plus shareholders' equity. Debt was $45.8 million at February 3, 2018 and $91.5 million at January 28, 2017, while shareholders' equity was $429.8 million at February 3, 2018 and $376.1 million at January 28, 2017. The decrease in debt since January 28, 2017 was primarily due to $118.6 million of cash flow from operations which was partially offset by cash payments of $38.7 million for capital expenditures, $18.2 million for dividends and $15.5 million for various acquisitions including post-closing payments for certain acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2016. Shareholders' equity increased from January 28, 2017, primarily as a result of net earnings less dividends paid during the period. Our debt levels and ratio of debt to total capital in future periods may not be comparable to historical amounts as we continue to assess, and possibly make changes to, our capital structure. Changes in our capital structure in the future, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nBalance Sheet\nThe following tables set forth certain information included in our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands). Below each table are explanations for any significant changes in the balances from January 28, 2017 to February 3, 2018.\nCurrent Assets:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2018\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables, net\n</td> <td>67,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net\n</td> <td>126,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>35,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Current Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017 represent typical cash amounts maintained on an ongoing basis in our operations, which generally ranges from $5 million to $10 million at any given time. Any excess cash is generally used to repay amounts outstanding under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. The increase in receivables, net as of February 3, 2018 was primarily due to a $5.0 million income tax receivable as of February 3, 2018 with no meaningful income\ntax receivable as of January 28, 2017 as well as higher trade receivables primarily reflecting higher wholesale sales in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 and lower wholesale allowance amounts.\nInventories, net as of February 3, 2018 decreased from January 28, 2017. This decrease includes decreases in Tommy Bahama, Corporate and Other, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide, partially offset by increased inventory in Lilly Pulitzer. Tommy Bahama's inventory decreased primarily due to a focus on more closely managing inventory purchases, the sale of certain prior season inventory through off-price wholesale channels and outlet stores during Fiscal 2017 and lower inventory in transit at year end due in part to the timing of Chinese New Year and the 53rd week of Fiscal 2017. The inventory reduction in Corporate and Other reflects the impact of LIFO accounting including changes in the amount of inventory markdowns requiring reversal as part of LIFO accounting as well as an increase in the LIFO reserve due to the increase in the PPI. The reduced inventory in Lanier Apparel was primarily due to the exit from and changes in certain replenishment programs resulting in lower inventory levels. Southern Tide's inventory decreased primarily due to initiatives to reduce on-hand inventory levels and clear prior season inventory more quickly. The increase in inventory at Lilly Pulitzer was primarily due to anticipated growth, including sales at the new retail store locations opened or acquired during Fiscal 2017. We believe that inventory levels in each operating group are appropriate to support anticipated sales for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2018.\nPrepaid expenses as of February 3, 2018 increased from January 28, 2017 as a result of higher (1) prepaid advertising associated with Spring and Summer 2018 advertising campaigns and the timing of certain advertising payments, (2) prepaid rent due to the timing of payment of monthly rent amounts as February 2018 rent payments were paid prior to February 3, 2018, but certain February 2017 rent payments had not been paid prior to January 28, 2017, and (3) other prepaid operating expenses primarily related to information technology related maintenance, services and software licenses. These increases were partially offset by lower prepaid taxes.\nNon-current Assets: Table 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>February 3, 2018\n</td> <td>January 28, 2017\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>178,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>66,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-current assets, net\n</td> <td>24,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-current assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and equipment, net as of February 3, 2018 is comparable to January 28, 2017 as capital expenditures and depreciation expense were generally comparable in Fiscal 2017.

The increased accrued compensation and other accrued expenses and liabilities were partially offset by lower (1) accounts payable primarily due to the lower inventory in transit amounts and the timing of payment of other amounts and (2) liabilities related to discontinued operations. The decrease in debt as of February 3, 2018 was primarily due to $118.6 million of cash flow from operations which was partially offset by cash payments of $38.7 million for capital expenditures, $18.2 million for dividends and $15.5 million for various acquisitions.\nOther non-current liabilities increased as of February 3, 2018 compared to January 28, 2017 primarily due to increases in deferred rent liabilities, including tenant improvement allowances from landlords, and deferred compensation liabilities. Deferred taxes increased as of February 3, 2018 compared to January 28, 2017 primarily due to timing differences associated with (1) depreciation recognized for tax and book purposes, including the $12 million impact of a cost segregation analysis completed in Fiscal 2017 and (2) amortization of intangible assets recognized for tax purposes, which were partially offset by (1) the $11.5 million impact of the revaluation of deferred tax amounts related to the U.S. Tax Reform, which reduced enacted tax rates in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017, and (2) timing differences associated with inventories. Liabilities related to discontinued operations, including current and non-current amounts, as of February 3, 2018 decreased primarily as a result of negotiated lease terminations in Fiscal 2017 for both lease agreements, with the final satisfaction of the $2.1 million liability associated with the lease obligations completed in February 2018. We do not anticipate cash flows or earnings related to the discontinued operations in future periods as we have satisfied all obligations related to these lease agreements.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the net cash flows, including continuing and discontinued operations, resulting in the change in our cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Table 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(54,277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(146,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13,946\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(64,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(559\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents on hand were $6.3 million and $6.3 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively. Changes in cash flows in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are discussed below.\nOperating Activities:\nIn Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, operating activities provided $118.6 million, $118.6 million and $105.4 million of cash, respectively. The cash flow from operating activities for each period was primarily the result of net earnings for the relevant period adjusted, as applicable, for non-cash activities including depreciation, amortization and equity-based compensation, as well as the net impact of changes in deferred taxes and our working capital accounts. In each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, working capital account changes had a favorable impact on cash flow from operations.\nIn Fiscal 2017, the more significant changes in working capital accounts were decreases in inventories, which increased cash flow from operations, partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and receivables, each of which decreased cash flow from operations. In Fiscal 2016, in addition to the favorable impact of deferred taxes, the more significant changes in working capital accounts were decreases in receivables and inventories, each of which increased cash flow from operations. In Fiscal 2015, the more significant changes in working capital accounts were a decrease in receivables and an increase in non-current liabilities, each of which increased cash flow from operations, partially offset by an increase in inventories, which decreased cash flow from operations.\nInvesting Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, investing activities used $54.3 million, $146.5 million and $13.9 million, respectively, of cash. Our cash flow used in investing activities on an ongoing basis typically consists of our capital expenditure investments in our existing brands and acquisitions of assets and operations of new businesses. Our capital expenditures primarily consist of costs associated with information technology initiatives, including e-commerce capabilities; opening, relocating and remodeling full-price retail stores and restaurants; and facilities enhancements for distribution centers and offices.\nIn Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, we paid $38.7 million, $49.4 million and $73.1 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we paid $15.5 million and $95.0 million, respectively, for acquisitions. Fiscal 2017 included amounts paid for various smaller acquisitions including the acquisition of the operations and assets of Beaufort Bonnet and 12 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores as well as post-closing payments for certain acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2016, while Fiscal 2016 included amounts paid for the acquisition of the operations and assets of Southern Tide, as well as other smaller acquisitions. Additionally, in Fiscal 2015 we received $59.3 million of proceeds for the sale of\nour Ben Sherman business, while in Fiscal 2016 we paid $2.0 million for the final working capital settlement associated with the sale of Ben Sherman.\nFinancing Activities:\nDuring Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, financing activities used $64.7 million of cash, provided $27.4 million of cash and used $91.5 million of cash, respectively. In Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2015, we decreased debt as our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital expenditures, payment of dividends and amounts paid related to acquisitions. During Fiscal 2016, we increased debt primarily for funding our Fiscal 2016 acquisition of Southern Tide, funding our capital expenditures and payment of dividends, which in the aggregate exceeded our cash flow from operations. During Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 we paid $18.2 million, $18.1 million and $16.6 million of dividends, respectively. Additionally, in Fiscal 2015, we also paid $12.5 million for the final payment for the contingent consideration arrangement related to the Lilly Pulitzer acquisition.\nWe anticipate that cash flow provided by or used in financing activities in the future will be dependent upon whether our cash flow from operating activities exceeds our capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions and any other investing or financing activities. Generally, we anticipate that excess cash, if any, will be used to repay debt on our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had $45.8 million outstanding as of February 3, 2018 under our $325 million Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement\") compared to $91.5 million of borrowings outstanding as of January 28, 2017. The U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement generally (1) is limited to a borrowing base consisting of specified percentages of eligible categories of assets, (2) accrues variable-rate interest (weighted average borrowing rate of 3.5% as of February 3, 2018), unused line fees and letter of credit fees based upon average unused availability or utilization, (3) requires periodic interest payments with principal due at maturity (May 2021) and (4) is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Oxford Industries, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries, including accounts receivable, books and records, chattel paper, deposit accounts, equipment, certain general intangibles, inventory, investment property (including the equity interests of certain subsidiaries), negotiable collateral, life insurance policies, supporting obligations, commercial tort claims, cash and cash equivalents, eligible trademarks, proceeds and other personal property.\nTo the extent cash flow needs exceed cash flow provided by our operations we will have access, subject to its terms, to our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement to provide funding for operating activities, capital expenditures and acquisitions, if any. Our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement is also used to establish collateral for certain insurance programs and leases and to finance trade letters of credit for product purchases, which reduce amounts available under our line of credit when issued. As of February 3, 2018, $4.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding against our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. After considering these limitations and the amount of eligible assets in our borrowing base, as applicable, as of February 3, 2018, we had $219.7 million in unused availability under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations on borrowings.\nCovenants, Other Restrictions and Prepayment Penalties\nThe U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information, compliance with law, maintenance of property, insurance requirements and conduct of business. Also, the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to certain negative covenants or other restrictions including, among other things, limitations on our ability to (1) incur debt, (2) guaranty certain obligations, (3) incur liens, (4) pay dividends to shareholders, (5) repurchase shares of our common stock, (6) make investments, (7) sell assets or stock of subsidiaries, (8) acquire assets or businesses, (9) merge or consolidate with other companies or (10) prepay, retire, repurchase or redeem debt.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if excess availability under the agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of (1) $23.5 million or (2) 10% of availability. In such case, our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement must not be less than 1.0 to 1.0 for the immediately preceding 12 fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered. This financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained excess availability under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement of more than the greater of (1) $23.5 million or (2) 10% of availability for 30 consecutive days.\nWe believe that the affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and other restrictions under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement are customary for those included in similar facilities entered into at the time we entered into the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. During Fiscal 2017 and as of February 3, 2018, no financial covenant testing was required\npursuant to our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met at all times. As of February 3, 2018, we were compliant with all covenants related to the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOther Liquidity Items:\nWe anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements, which generally consist of working capital and other operating activity needs, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends, if any, primarily from positive cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally in the fall and spring of each year. Our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products. We anticipate that at the maturity of the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement or as otherwise deemed appropriate, we will be able to refinance the facility or obtain other financing on terms available in the market at that time. The terms of any future financing arrangements may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreement or current market terms.\nOn March 27, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per share payable on May 4, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2018. This represents a 26% increase from the quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share paid in each quarter of Fiscal 2017, as noted in the table above. Although we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in July 1960, we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital, including payment of outstanding debt, funding of acquisitions, funding of capital expenditures or repurchases of outstanding shares, may be in our best interest; if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend; or if the terms of our credit facility, other debt instruments or applicable law limit our ability to pay dividends. We may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facility, other debt instruments and applicable law. All cash flow from operations will not be paid out as dividends in all periods. For details about limitations on our ability to pay dividends, see the discussion of the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement above.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, as of February 3, 2018, by future period (in thousands): Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 year\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>67,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty and advertising payments pursuant to royalty agreements\n</td> <td>5,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)(4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Principal and interest amounts payable in future periods on our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement have been excluded from the table above, as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time.

As the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods, scheduling deferred income tax amounts by period could be misleading.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2018, which are excluded from the table above as we are generally not contractually obligated to pay these amounts as of February 3, 2018, are expected to approach $60 million. These expenditures are expected to consist primarily of costs associated with information technology initiatives, including e-commerce capabilities; opening, relocating and remodeling full-price retail stores and restaurants; and facilities enhancements. Our capital expenditure amounts in future years may increase or decrease from the amounts incurred in prior years depending on the information technology initiatives, full-price retail store and restaurant openings, relocations and remodels and other infrastructure requirements deemed appropriate for that year to support future expansion of our businesses.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into agreements which meet the SEC's definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement, other than operating leases, and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with respect to any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in a consistent manner. The preparation of these financial statements requires the selection and application of accounting policies. Further, the application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those discussed below. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies. However, in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below, our consolidated statements of operations could be misstated.\nA detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments we use or the amounts most sensitive to change from outside factors.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nOur revenue consists of direct to consumer sales, which includes retail store, e-commerce and restaurant sales, as well as wholesale sales. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.\nAn area of judgment affecting reported revenues and net earnings involves estimating sales reserves, which represent a portion of revenues not expected to be realized. We record our revenues net of estimated discounts, allowances, cooperative advertising, operational chargebacks and returns, as appropriate. As certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season, program or other event which may not have occurred yet, we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis. Significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts, allowances, operational chargebacks and returns for wholesale customers may include historical and current trends, agreements with customers, projected seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions, specific program or product expectations and retail performance. Actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods. As of February 3, 2018, our total reserves for discounts, returns and allowances for our wholesale businesses were $6.5 million and,\ntherefore, if the allowances changed by 10% it would have had a pre-tax impact of $0.7 million on earnings in Fiscal 2017. The substantial majority of these reserves as of February 3, 2018 relate to our Lanier Apparel business.\nAs direct to consumer products may be returned after the date of original purchase by the consumer, we must make estimates of reserves for products which were sold prior to the balance sheet date but that we anticipate may be returned by the consumer subsequent to that date. The determination of direct to consumer return reserve amounts requires judgment and consideration of historical and current trends, evaluation of current economic trends and other factors. Our historical estimates of direct to consumer return reserves have not differed materially from actual results. As of February 3, 2018, our direct to consumer return reserve was $4.2 million. A 10% change in the direct to consumer return reserve as of February 3, 2018 would have had a $0.3 million pre-tax impact on earnings in Fiscal 2017.\nFor our wholesale receivables, we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience, the financial condition of our customers, an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends, each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions. Actual charges for bad debts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods. As of February 3, 2018, our allowance for bad debts was $1.7 million, and therefore, if the allowance for bad debts changed by 10% it would have had a pre-tax impact of $0.2 million on earnings in Fiscal 2017. While the amounts deemed uncollectible have not been significant in recent years if, in the future, amounts due from significant customer(s) were deemed to be uncollectible as a result of events that occur subsequent to February 3, 2018 this could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of operations in future periods.\nWe will adopt the revised guidance for revenue recognition on the first day of Fiscal 2018. Adoption of this standard will result in a change to our revenue recognition policy, but the changes are not expected to result in a material change in the timing or amounts of revenue recognized. Refer to Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the anticipated impact of the new revenue recognition guidance.\nInventories, net\nFor operating group reporting, inventory is carried at the lower of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method cost or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories, substantially all of which is finished goods inventory, for identification of distressed inventory. In performing this evaluation, we consider slow-turning products, an indication of lack of consumer acceptance of particular products, prior seasons' fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates. We estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary. As the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end, we must utilize certain assumptions considering historical experience, inventory quantity, quality, age and mix, historical sales trends, future sales projections, consumer and retailer preferences, market trends, general economic conditions and our plans to sell the inventory. Also, we provide an allowance for shrinkage, as appropriate, for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date. Historically, our estimates of inventory markdowns and inventory shrinkage have not varied significantly from actual results.\nFor consolidated financial reporting, $118.0 million, or 93%, of our inventories are valued at the lower of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method cost or market after deducting the $61.5 million LIFO reserve as of February 3, 2018. The remaining $8.8 million of our inventories are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market as of February 3, 2018. LIFO reserves are based on the Producer Price Index (PPI) as published by the United States Department of Labor. We write down inventories valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market when LIFO cost exceeds market value. We deem LIFO accounting adjustments to not only include changes in the LIFO reserve, but also changes in markdown reserves which are considered in LIFO accounting. As our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the respective operating groups. Thus, the impact of accounting for inventories on the LIFO method is reflected in Corporate and Other for operating group reporting purposes.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we had recorded a reserve of $1.1 million related to inventory on the lower of FIFO cost or market method and for inventory on the lower of LIFO cost or market method with markdowns in excess of our LIFO reserve. A 10% change in the amount of such markdowns would have a pre-tax impact of $0.1 million on earnings in Fiscal 2017. A change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market method that is not marked down in excess of our LIFO reserve typically would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A change in inventory levels, or the mix by inventory category, at the end of future fiscal years compared to inventory balances as of February 3, 2018 could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual LIFO computation. Additionally, a change in the PPI as published by the United States Department of Labor as compared to the indexes as of February 3, 2018 could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as inflation or deflation would change the amount of our LIFO reserve.\nGiven the significant amount of uncertainty surrounding the year-end LIFO calculation, including the estimate of year-end inventory balances, the proportion of inventory in each inventory category and the year-end PPI, we typically do not adjust our LIFO reserve in the first three quarters of a fiscal year. This policy may result in significant LIFO accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year resulting from the year over year changes in inventory levels, the PPI and markdown reserves. We do recognize on a quarterly basis during each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year changes in markdown reserves as those amounts can be estimated on a quarterly basis.\nAccounting for business combinations requires that assets and liabilities, including inventories, are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. In accordance with GAAP, the definition of fair value of inventories acquired generally will equal the expected sales price less certain costs associated with selling the inventory, which may exceed the actual cost of producing the acquired inventories. Based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories, amounts are recognized as additional cost of goods sold in the periods subsequent to the acquisition as the acquired inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business. In determining the fair value of the acquired inventory, as well as the appropriate period to recognize the charge in our consolidated statements of operations as the acquired inventory is sold, we must make certain assumptions regarding costs incurred prior to acquisition for the acquired inventory, an appropriate profit allowance, estimates of the costs to sell the inventory and the timing of the sale of the acquired inventory. Such estimates involve significant uncertainty, and the use of different assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nThe cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on their estimated fair values. The assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets, anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. In certain of our acquisitions, significant intangible assets and goodwill were acquired resulting in $178.9 million of intangible assets and $66.7 million of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2018.\nOur intangibles assets primarily consist of trademarks, reacquired rights and customer relationships. Goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition. See Note 4 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details about our various intangible assets and goodwill amounts.\nThe fair values and useful lives of these acquired intangible assets and goodwill are estimated based on our assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases. Such valuations, which are dependent upon a number of uncertain factors, may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues and expenses or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk-adjusted market-based cost of capital as the discount rate. The valuation of intangible assets and goodwill requires significant judgment due to the variety of uncertain factors, including planned use of the intangible assets as well as estimates of net sales, royalty income, operating income, growth rates, royalty rates for the trademarks, discount rates and income tax rates, among other factors. The use of different assumptions related to these uncertain factors at acquisition or a later date could result in a material change to the amounts of intangible assets and goodwill initially recorded at acquisition, which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTrademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill are not amortized but instead evaluated, either qualitatively or quantitatively, for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset or goodwill might be impaired. The evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis which is typically similar to the analysis performed at acquisition. This approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors, including those used in the initial valuation of the intangible assets and goodwill listed above. Such estimates involve significant uncertainty, and if our plans or anticipated results change, the impact on our financial statements could be significant. If this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life, the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAmortization of intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trademarks, reacquired rights and customer relationships, is recognized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of amortization or another method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to 20 years. The determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on the remaining contractual period, as applicable, our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control, including expected customer attrition. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If expected future discounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts, an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Amortization\nrelated to intangible assets with finite lives totaled $2.4 million during Fiscal 2017 and is anticipated to be approximately $2.6 million in Fiscal 2018.\nGoodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. The quantitative test includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables, which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal. Significant estimates, some of which may be very subjective, considered in such a discounted cash flow analysis are future cash flow projections of the business, a risk-adjusted market-based cost of capital as the discount rate, income tax rates and other assumptions. The estimates and assumptions included in the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill involve significant uncertainty, and if our plans or anticipated results change, the impact on our financial statements could be significant. If an annual or interim analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances, the impairment is recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of the goodwill.\nIntangible assets and goodwill acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily since they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results, plans for the acquired business and/or macroeconomic conditions change after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A change in macroeconomic conditions may not only impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also impact other assumptions used in our analysis, including but not limited to, the risk-adjusted market-based cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical market participant would use. Therefore, the cost of capital discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital changed. As we acquired Southern Tide in Fiscal 2016 and recorded a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill related to this acquisition, the assets recognized are more sensitive to changes in assumptions than our other intangible assets and goodwill amounts.\nIn Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, no impairment charges related to intangible assets or goodwill were recognized.\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nFor many assets and liabilities, the determination of fair value may not require the use of many assumptions or other estimates. However, in some cases the assumptions or inputs associated with the determination of fair value as of a measurement date may require the use of many assumptions and may be internally derived or otherwise unobservable. We utilize certain market-based and internally derived information and make assumptions about the information in determining (1) the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination, (2) adjusting recognized assets and liabilities to fair value and (3) and assessing recognized assets for impairment, including intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment.\nAs noted above, the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on its estimated fair value. The assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets, anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. To the extent information to revise the allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price will be adjusted. Should information become available after the allocation period indicating that adjustments to the allocation are appropriate, those adjustments will be included in operating results.\nFor the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination, adjusting recognized assets and liabilities to fair value and assessing, and possibly adjusting, recognized assets for impairment, the assumptions, or the timing of changes in these assumptions, that we make regarding the valuation of these assets could differ significantly from the assumptions made by other parties. The use of different assumptions could result in materially different valuations for the respective assets and liabilities, which would impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements to compensate the sellers if certain targets are achieved. For a contingent consideration arrangement, if any, as of the date of acquisition we must determine the fair value of the contingent consideration which would estimate the discounted fair value of any expected payments. Such valuation requires assumptions regarding anticipated cash flows, probabilities of cash flows, discount rates and other factors, each requiring a significant amount of judgment. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we are required to periodically adjust the liability for the contingent consideration to reflect the fair value of the contingent consideration by reassessing any valuation assumptions as of the balance sheet date.\nFrom time to time, we may recognize certain obligations related to certain leased space associated with exiting retail or office space. In these cases, we must determine the net loss related to the space if the anticipated cash outflows for the space\nexceed the estimated cash inflows related to the space. While estimated cash outflows are generally known since there is an underlying lease, the estimated cash inflows for sublease rental income and other costs are often very subjective if there is not a sub-lease agreement in place at that time since those amounts are dependent upon many factors including, but not limited to, whether a sub-tenant will be obtained, the time required to obtain the sub-tenant as well as the rent payments and any tenant allowances agreed with the sub-tenant as part of the future lease negotiations. Also, it is possible that we could negotiate a lease termination in the future that would differ from the amount of the required payments pursuant to the lease agreement. Thus, our estimate of a liability related to a lease obligation could change significantly as we obtain better information in the future or if our current assumptions do not materialize. The assumptions made by another party related to such leases could be different than the assumptions made by us.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nValuation allowances, which total $5.6 million as of February 3, 2018, are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that would indicate adjustments to the valuation allowances are appropriate. Valuation allowance amounts could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations in the future if assumptions related to realizability of the deferred tax assets changed significantly. Additionally, the timing of recognition of a valuation allowance or any reversal of a valuation allowance requires a significant amount of judgment to assess all the positive and negative evidence, particularly when operating results in the respective jurisdiction have changed or are expected to change from losses to income or from income to losses. As realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities is dependent upon future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and rates and shifts in the amount of taxable income among state and foreign jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the amount of benefit ultimately realized for deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAs a global company, we are subject to income taxes in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, our income tax provision involves many uncertainties due to not only the timing differences of income for financial statement reporting and tax return reporting, but also the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to interpretation and management judgment. The use of different assumptions or a change in our assumptions related to book to tax timing differences, our determination of whether foreign investments or earnings are permanently reinvested, the ability to realize uncertain tax positions, the appropriateness of valuation allowances, a reduction in valuation allowances or other considerations, transfer pricing practices, the impact of our tax planning strategies and the jurisdictions or significance of earnings in future periods each could have a significant impact on our income tax rate. Additionally, factors impacting income taxes including changes in tax laws or interpretations, court case decisions, statute of limitation expirations or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our income tax rate. An increase in our consolidated income tax rate from 21.9% to 22.9% during Fiscal 2017 would have reduced net earnings by $0.8 million.\nU.S. Tax Reform, as enacted on December 22, 2017, made significant changes in the taxation of our domestic and foreign earnings. The federal tax was lowered from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended federal rate applicable to our fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 to reflect the weighted average of the rate applicable to the period prior to the effective date and the period on and after the effective date. The change in the federal tax rate also required revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the enacted rate at which we expect those differences to reverse. The Act moves to a territorial taxation system under which the earnings of foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to United States tax upon distribution and imposed a one-time transition tax on the amount of previously untaxed earnings of those foreign subsidiaries measured as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017, whichever resulted in the greater taxable amount. Additional changes included the increase in bonus depreciation available for certain assets acquired after September 27, 2017 and limitations on the deduction for certain expenses, including executive compensation and interest incurred in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. New taxes were imposed related to foreign income, including a tax on global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) and disallowance of deduction for certain payments (the base erosion anti-abuse tax, or BEAT\u201d) and new deductions enacted for certain foreign-derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d). As a result of the provisional revaluation impact on our deferred taxes and certain other items related to U.S. Tax Reform, we recognized a reduction in tax expense of $11.5 million in our Fiscal 2017 statement of operations.\nThe SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. We have estimated provisional tax amounts related to our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, including the impacts of the change in the corporate tax rate, executive compensation, our indefinite\nreinvestment assertion, the transition tax, GILTI, BEAT, and FDII. We have not yet elected an accounting policy related to how we will account for GILTI and therefore have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements as of February 3, 2018. We are still finalizing our calculations related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The final impact of U.S. Tax Reform may differ from our provisional amounts recognized in Fiscal 2017 due to additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, us obtaining additional information to refine our estimated tax amounts and changes in current interpretations and assumptions. We expect to finalize our accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform during Fiscal 2018.\nIncome tax expense recorded during interim periods is generally based on the expected tax rate for the year, considering projections of earnings and book to tax differences as of the balance sheet date, subject to certain limitations associated with separate foreign jurisdiction losses in interim periods. The tax rate ultimately realized for the year may increase or decrease due to actual operating results or book to tax differences varying from the amounts on which our interim calculations were based. Any changes in assumptions related to the need for a valuation allowance, the ability to realize an uncertain tax position, changes in enacted tax rates, the expected operating results in total or by jurisdiction for the year, or other assumptions are accounted for in the period in which the change occurs. As certain of our foreign operations are in a loss position and realization of a future benefit for the losses is uncertain, a significant variance in losses in such jurisdictions from our expectations can have a significant impact on our expected annual tax rate. The recognition of the benefit of losses expected to be realized may be limited in an interim period and may require adjustments to tax expense in the interim period that yield an effective tax rate for the interim period that is not representative of the expected tax rate for the full year.\nSee Note 8 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of income taxes.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have not yet adopted that are expected to possibly have a material affect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSEASONALITY\nEach of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. For information regarding the seasonality impact on individual operating groups and for our total company, see Part I, Item 1, Business, included in this report.", "summary": "This report provides an overview of the operations of a global apparel company, focusing on its successful lifestyle brands including Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Southern Tide.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2017, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2017, 97% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama product sales in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection, like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, including Marlin Bars, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers. Additionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 19% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands generally include various specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S. and foreign-based apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe disposal of discontinued, end of season or excess inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business, and our operating groups have historically utilized a variety of methods to sell such inventory, including outlet stores in Tommy Bahama, e-commerce flash sales on our various e-commerce websites, and off-price retailers. Our focus in disposing of the excess inventory for our lifestyle brands is to do so in a brand appropriate setting and achieve an acceptable margin.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe the changes in consumer preferences for discretionary spending, the current global economic conditions and economic uncertainty continue to impact the business of each of our operating groups, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers may have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence of the evolution is apparent with weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. These changes may require that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, differently than historical practices.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long-term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable store sales. We also believe growth can be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations for additional stores.\nWe believe our lifestyle brands have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long-term. However, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 16% in Fiscal 2016. As a result, this management of our wholesale distribution for our lifestyle brands is likely to result in lower wholesale sales in Fiscal 2018, as well as in the near-term future, as we may reduce the amount of sales to certain wholesale accounts by reducing the number of doors that carry our product, reducing the volume sold for a particular door or exiting the account altogether. We anticipate that sales increases in our wholesale businesses in the long-term will stem primarily from current customers adding within their existing door count and increasing their online business; increased sales to online retailers; and our selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting and who present and merchandise our products in a way that is consistent with our full-price, direct to consumer distribution strategy. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs and licenses.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and restaurant build-out for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate increased advertising, employment and other costs to support ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth. Fiscal 2018 advertising expense is expected to increase for each of our brands with a focus on new consumer acquisition as well as consumer retention and engagement.\nIn the midst of the changes in our industry, an important initiative for us in Fiscal 2017 was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focused on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses. In Fiscal 2017, we made progress with these initiatives and expect to make additional progress in Fiscal 2018.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria. With the evolving fashion\nretail environment, our interest in acquiring smaller brands and earlier stage companies is evolving, particularly where we may have the opportunity to more fully integrate the brand into our existing infrastructure and shared services functions.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016: \nThe higher net earnings in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to (1) a lower effective tax rate primarily resulting from U.S. Tax Reform as discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, (2) higher operating income in Tommy Bahama and (3) improved operating results in Southern Tide, which included certain purchase accounting charges in Fiscal 2016 and was not owned for the full year in Fiscal 2016. These items were partially offset by (1) the impact of LIFO accounting on Corporate and Other operating results, (2) lower operating income in Lilly Pulitzer, due in part to charges associated with the Fiscal 2017 acquisition of certain Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store operations, and (3) lower operating income in Lanier Apparel.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO accounting adjustments for inventory, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center and Beaufort Bonnet, which are not included in our operating groups. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales in our comparable store sales disclosures is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel or other event resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening, or other event. A store that is remodeled will generally continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for longer than a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year because the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we expect to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales. We have calculated all percentages based on actual data, but percentage columns may not add due to rounding. Individual line items of our consolidated statements of operations may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors, as classification of certain expenses may vary by company. \nUnless otherwise indicated, all references to assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other information in this report reflect continuing operations and exclude any amounts related to the discontinued operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group which we sold in Fiscal 2015. Refer to Note 13 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about discontinued operations.\nFISCAL 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2016\nThe discussion and tables below compare certain line items included in our statements of operations for Fiscal 2017, which included 53 weeks, to Fiscal 2016, which included 52 weeks. Each dollar and percentage change provided reflects the change between these periods unless indicated otherwise. Each dollar and share amount included in the tables is in thousands except for per share amounts.\nNet Sales\n\nConsolidated net sales increased $63.6 million, or 6.2%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016. The increase in consolidated net sales was driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $20.9 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and the Southern Tide e-commerce operations, which we acquired in April 2016, (2) an $18.5 million, or 4% increase in comparable store sales to $444.7 million in Fiscal 2017 from $426.1 million in Fiscal 2016, (3) a net $17.7 million aggregate increase in wholesale sales, primarily consisting of higher sales in Southern Tide, which we acquired in April 2016, Lanier Apparel, Tommy Bahama and Corporate and Other partially offset by a decrease in Lilly Pulitzer and (4) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels consisting of lower sales in Tommy Bahama and higher sales in Lilly Pulitzer. We estimate that the 53rd week in Fiscal 2017 provided an approximate $17 million benefit to our consolidated net sales. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, comparable store sales increased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic and the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits, continue to impact the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\n\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $27.1 million, or 4.1%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of (1) a $20.5 million, or 6%, increase in comparable store sales to $340.0 million in Fiscal 2017 from $319.5 million in Fiscal 2016, (2) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales reflecting sales from a restaurant that opened in Fiscal 2017, a Marlin Bar that opened in late Fiscal 2016 and increased sales at existing restaurants, (3) an incremental net sales increase of $5.4 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and (4) a $2.6 million increase in wholesale sales reflecting higher off-price sales, as Tommy Bahama sold excess prior season inventory, partially offset by lower full-price wholesale sales, as Tommy Bahama continued to manage its exposure to department stores. These increases were partially offset by $11.0 million of lower sales in our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily resulting from the absence of any e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to $8.9 million of e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2016, as well as lower sales in existing outlet stores. Tommy Bahama's direct to consumer sales benefited from (1) increased marketing and advertising including substantial Spring 2017 and Holiday 2017 catalogs, which both presented the wide breadth of Tommy Bahama products in one place, (2) increased sales from its semiannual Friends & Family events held each year, (3) increased sales from Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card and Flip Side events held in the second quarter and fourth quarter of each year and (4) Tommy Bahama taking initial markdowns on select items at the end of the selling season in our retail stores and on our e-commerce website in Fiscal 2017 after initiating that approach in January 2017. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Tommy Bahama comparable store sales increased 5% in Fiscal 2017. We expect full-price and off-price wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama to decrease in Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 amounts.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 166 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 110 full-price retail stores, 18 restaurant-retail locations and 38 outlet stores. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 restaurant-retail locations and 40 outlet stores.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\n\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $15.6 million, or 6.7%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $13.8 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) an $8.0 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales increases were partially offset by (1) a $4.2 million decrease in wholesale sales and (2) a $1.9 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $104.7 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to $106.6 million in Fiscal 2016, with negative retail comparable store sales offsetting positive e-commerce comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store sales primarily reflects reduced retail store traffic while the lower wholesale sales were a result of lower sales to department stores, as Lilly Pulitzer continues to manage its exposure to department stores, and the result of the acquisition of 12 Signature Stores in Fiscal 2017. We expect wholesale sales in Lilly Pulitzer will be lower in Fiscal 2018 than Fiscal 2017 due to this acquisition of 12 Signature Stores and the continued management of department store exposure. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Lilly Pulitzer comparable store sales decreased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 57 Lilly Pulitzer retail stores, compared to 40 retail stores as of January 28, 2017. During Fiscal 2017, Lilly Pulitzer opened six new Lilly Pulitzer stores, acquired 12 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores and closed one store.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\n\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $6.1 million, or 6.1%, was primarily due to increased sales in various programs, including initial shipments in some programs, as well as sales associated with the Strong Suit and Duck Head businesses, which were acquired in Fiscal 2016. These sales increases were partially offset by lower sales in other programs resulting from reductions in volume and the exit from various programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe increase in net sales of $13.5 million for Southern Tide in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to Fiscal 2017 including a full year of operations, while Fiscal 2016 only included the operations from the date of our acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. Therefore, net sales for Fiscal 2016 excluded much of the Spring 2016 wholesale shipments.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Southern Tide for each period presented:\n\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers and Beaufort Bonnet, which was acquired in December 2017, as well as the impact of the elimination of any intercompany sales between our operating groups.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our operations, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands, other owned brands and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2017, 92% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 66% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2017, 97% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama product sales in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\nOur business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection, like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them.\nOur ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.\nTo further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of the brands. Our advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.\nWe distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate a limited number of restaurants, including Marlin Bars, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers. Additionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 19% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products.\nThe wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands generally include various specialty stores, including Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers.\nWithin our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private labels and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others throughout the United States.\nAll of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S. and foreign-based apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.\nThe disposal of discontinued, end of season or excess inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business, and our operating groups have historically utilized a variety of methods to sell such inventory, including outlet stores in Tommy Bahama, e-commerce flash sales on our various e-commerce websites, and off-price retailers. Our focus in disposing of the excess inventory for our lifestyle brands is to do so in a brand appropriate setting and achieve an acceptable margin.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries. We believe the changes in consumer preferences for discretionary spending, the current global economic conditions and economic uncertainty continue to impact the business of each of our operating groups, and the apparel industry as a whole.\nWe believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers may have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This, along with the coming of age of the millennial\u201d generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods. The evidence of the evolution is apparent with weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. These changes may require that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, differently than historical practices.\nWhile this evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long-term while managing the various challenges facing our industry.\nSpecifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable store sales. We also believe growth can be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store operations and modest comparable full-price retail store sales increases. Despite the changes in the retail environment, we expect there will continue to be desirable locations for additional stores.\nWe believe our lifestyle brands have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long-term. However, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 16% in Fiscal 2016. As a result, this management of our wholesale distribution for our lifestyle brands is likely to result in lower wholesale sales in Fiscal 2018, as well as in the near-term future, as we may reduce the amount of sales to certain wholesale accounts by reducing the number of doors that carry our product, reducing the volume sold for a particular door or exiting the account altogether. We anticipate that sales increases in our wholesale businesses in the long-term will stem primarily from current customers adding within their existing door count and increasing their online business; increased sales to online retailers; and our selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a retail model with limited discounting and who present and merchandise our products in a way that is consistent with our full-price, direct to consumer distribution strategy. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs and licenses.\nWe believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and restaurant build-out for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate increased advertising, employment and other costs to support ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth. Fiscal 2018 advertising expense is expected to increase for each of our brands with a focus on new consumer acquisition as well as consumer retention and engagement.\nIn the midst of the changes in our industry, an important initiative for us in Fiscal 2017 was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focused on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses. In Fiscal 2017, we made progress with these initiatives and expect to make additional progress in Fiscal 2018.\nWe continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations in the future, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria. With the evolving fashion\nretail environment, our interest in acquiring smaller brands and earlier stage companies is evolving, particularly where we may have the opportunity to more fully integrate the brand into our existing infrastructure and shared services functions.\nImportant factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016: Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher net earnings in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to (1) a lower effective tax rate primarily resulting from U.S. Tax Reform as discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, (2) higher operating income in Tommy Bahama and (3) improved operating results in Southern Tide, which included certain purchase accounting charges in Fiscal 2016 and was not owned for the full year in Fiscal 2016. These items were partially offset by (1) the impact of LIFO accounting on Corporate and Other operating results, (2) lower operating income in Lilly Pulitzer, due in part to charges associated with the Fiscal 2017 acquisition of certain Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store operations, and (3) lower operating income in Lanier Apparel.\nOPERATING GROUPS\nOur business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO accounting adjustments for inventory, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center and Beaufort Bonnet, which are not included in our operating groups. Our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups.\nFor additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part I, Item 1. Business and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, both included in this report.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nWe often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods. Our disclosures of comparable store sales include net sales from full-price retail stores and our e-commerce sites, excluding sales associated with e-commerce flash clearance sales. We believe that the inclusion of both our full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results, given similar inventory planning, allocation and return policies, as well as our cross-channel marketing and other initiatives for the direct to consumer channel. For our comparable store sales disclosures, we exclude (1) outlet store sales, warehouse sales and e-commerce flash clearance sales, as those clearance sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory, which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occur at lower gross margins than our non-clearance direct to consumer sales, and (2) restaurant sales, as we do not currently believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales in our comparable store sales disclosures is meaningful in assessing our consolidated results of operations. Comparable store sales information reflects net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, if any, associated with product sales.\nFor purposes of our disclosures, we consider a comparable store to be, in addition to our e-commerce sites, a physical full-price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not have during the relevant periods, and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to have, (1) a remodel or other event resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time (which we define as a period of two weeks or longer), (2) a greater than 15% change in the size of the retail space due to expansion, reduction or relocation to a new retail space, (3) a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space, or (4) a closing or opening of a Tommy Bahama restaurant adjacent to the full-price retail store. For those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence, the stores continue to be excluded from comparable store sales until the criteria for a new store is met subsequent to the remodel, relocation or restaurant closing or opening, or other event. A store that is remodeled will generally continue to be included in our comparable store sales metrics as a store is not typically closed for longer than a two week period during a remodel; however, in some cases a store may be closed for more than two weeks during a remodel. A store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store sales metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year because the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or current fiscal year, or which we expect to close or vacate in the current fiscal year, are excluded from the definition of comparable store sales.\nDefinitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among retail companies, and therefore comparable store sales metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the specified line items in our consolidated statements of operations both in dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales.

The increase in consolidated net sales was driven by (1) an incremental net sales increase of $20.9 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and the Southern Tide e-commerce operations, which we acquired in April 2016, (2) an $18.5 million, or 4% increase in comparable store sales to $444.7 million in Fiscal 2017 from $426.1 million in Fiscal 2016, (3) a net $17.7 million aggregate increase in wholesale sales, primarily consisting of higher sales in Southern Tide, which we acquired in April 2016, Lanier Apparel, Tommy Bahama and Corporate and Other partially offset by a decrease in Lilly Pulitzer and (4) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales in Tommy Bahama. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in net sales through our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels consisting of lower sales in Tommy Bahama and higher sales in Lilly Pulitzer. We estimate that the 53rd week in Fiscal 2017 provided an approximate $17 million benefit to our consolidated net sales. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, comparable store sales increased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that certain macroeconomic factors, including lower retail store traffic and the evolving impact of digital technology on consumer shopping habits, continue to impact the sales in each of our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses. The changes in net sales by operating group are discussed below.\nThe following table presents the proportion of our consolidated net sales by distribution channel for each period presented:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTommy Bahama:\nThe Tommy Bahama net sales increase of $27.1 million, or 4.1%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of (1) a $20.5 million, or 6%, increase in comparable store sales to $340.0 million in Fiscal 2017 from $319.5 million in Fiscal 2016, (2) a $9.5 million increase in restaurant sales reflecting sales from a restaurant that opened in Fiscal 2017, a Marlin Bar that opened in late Fiscal 2016 and increased sales at existing restaurants, (3) an incremental net sales increase of $5.4 million associated with the operation of non-comp full-price retail stores and (4) a $2.6 million increase in wholesale sales reflecting higher off-price sales, as Tommy Bahama sold excess prior season inventory, partially offset by lower full-price wholesale sales, as Tommy Bahama continued to manage its exposure to department stores. These increases were partially offset by $11.0 million of lower sales in our off-price direct to consumer clearance channels, primarily resulting from the absence of any e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2017, compared to $8.9 million of e-commerce flash clearance sales in Fiscal 2016, as well as lower sales in existing outlet stores. Tommy Bahama's direct to consumer sales benefited from (1) increased marketing and advertising including substantial Spring 2017 and Holiday 2017 catalogs, which both presented the wide breadth of Tommy Bahama products in one place, (2) increased sales from its semiannual Friends & Family events held each year, (3) increased sales from Tommy Bahama's loyalty award card and Flip Side events held in the second quarter and fourth quarter of each year and (4) Tommy Bahama taking initial markdowns on select items at the end of the selling season in our retail stores and on our e-commerce website in Fiscal 2017 after initiating that approach in January 2017. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Tommy Bahama comparable store sales increased 5% in Fiscal 2017. We expect full-price and off-price wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama to decrease in Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 amounts.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 166 Tommy Bahama stores globally, consisting of 110 full-price retail stores, 18 restaurant-retail locations and 38 outlet stores. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 168 Tommy Bahama stores consisting of 111 full-price retail stores, 17 restaurant-retail locations and 40 outlet stores.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Tommy Bahama for each period presented:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and outlets\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLilly Pulitzer:\nThe Lilly Pulitzer net sales increase of $15.6 million, or 6.7%, in the 53 week Fiscal 2017 compared to the 52 week Fiscal 2016, was primarily a result of (1) an incremental net sales increase of $13.8 million associated with the operation of additional full-price retail stores and (2) an $8.0 million increase in e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales increases were partially offset by (1) a $4.2 million decrease in wholesale sales and (2) a $1.9 million, or 2%, decrease in comparable store sales to $104.7 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to $106.6 million in Fiscal 2016, with negative retail comparable store sales offsetting positive e-commerce comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store sales primarily reflects reduced retail store traffic while the lower wholesale sales were a result of lower sales to department stores, as Lilly Pulitzer continues to manage its exposure to department stores, and the result of the acquisition of 12 Signature Stores in Fiscal 2017. We expect wholesale sales in Lilly Pulitzer will be lower in Fiscal 2018 than Fiscal 2017 due to this acquisition of 12 Signature Stores and the continued management of department store exposure. On a 53 week to 53 week basis, Lilly Pulitzer comparable store sales decreased 3% in Fiscal 2017.\nAs of February 3, 2018, we operated 57 Lilly Pulitzer retail stores, compared to 40 retail stores as of January 28, 2017. During Fiscal 2017, Lilly Pulitzer opened six new Lilly Pulitzer stores, acquired 12 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores and closed one store.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Lilly Pulitzer for each period presented:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full-price retail stores and warehouse sales\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLanier Apparel:\nThe increase in net sales for Lanier Apparel of $6.1 million, or 6.1%, was primarily due to increased sales in various programs, including initial shipments in some programs, as well as sales associated with the Strong Suit and Duck Head businesses, which were acquired in Fiscal 2016. These sales increases were partially offset by lower sales in other programs resulting from reductions in volume and the exit from various programs.\nSouthern Tide:\nThe increase in net sales of $13.5 million for Southern Tide in Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to Fiscal 2017 including a full year of operations, while Fiscal 2016 only included the operations from the date of our acquisition on April 19, 2016 through January 28, 2017. Therefore, net sales for Fiscal 2016 excluded much of the Spring 2016 wholesale shipments.\nThe following table presents the proportion of net sales by distribution channel for Southern Tide for each period presented:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E-commerce\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other:\nCorporate and Other net sales primarily consist of the net sales of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center to third party warehouse customers and Beaufort Bonnet, which was acquired in December 2017, as well as the impact of the elimination of any intercompany sales between our operating groups.\nGross Profit\nThe table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, as well as the change between those two periods. Our gross profit and gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors as the statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tommy Bahama\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lilly Pulitzer\n</td> <td>155,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lanier Apparel\n</td> <td>32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southern Tide\n</td> <td>20,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,305\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
