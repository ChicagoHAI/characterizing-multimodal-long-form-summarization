The increase was driven by higher sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $139.9 million, $42.8 million and $33.0 million, respectively. Gross profit increased $39.7 million compared with 2017. The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases across all of our segments, with increases in Performance Coatings, Color Solutions and Performance Colors and Glass and of $19.9 million, $11.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit rate decreased approximately 150 basis points to 28.3%, from 29.8% in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $13.1 million, or 5.0%, compared with 2017. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017, and net income attributable to common shareholders was $80.1 million, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $57.1 million in 2017.\nAs previously disclosed on January 17, 2019, the Company is in the process of expanding its production facility in Villagran, Mexico, which will become the Company's Manufacturing Center of Excellence for the Americas. The expansion of the Villagran facility is expected to significantly increase the revenue generated from products manufactured at that facility. With the expanded capacity in Villagran, the Company (i) will discontinue the production of glass enamels, other industrial specialty products, such as architectural glass coatings, and pigments at its Washington, Pennsylvania facility over the course of 2019 and into 2020, (ii) plans to discontinue production of porcelain enamel products at its Cleveland, Ohio facility and (iii) will close additional facilities in Latin America. As part of this optimization initiative, the Company is expanding its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. Conductive glass coatings production will be discontinued at the Washington, Pennsylvania facility and will be produced at the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility, and the Company's operations at its Vista, California facility will be transferred to the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. In addition, the Company will be moving its Americas research and development center for glass products to its technology center in Independence, Ohio, where the Company is investing in expanded laboratory facilities. The Washington, Pennsylvania facility is expected to remain in operation until sometime in 2020. Production of specialty glasses for electronics applications will continue at the Cleveland, Ohio facility, and the Company will invest in the facility to equip it to serve as a logistics center. The Cleveland, Ohio facility also will serve as the Americas research and development center for the porcelain enamel business.\n\ufeff\n2018 Transactional Activity\nTransactions undertaken in 2018 included the following business acquisitions:\nAcquisition of Quimicer, S.A.

We continue to execute the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of our value creation strategy, which includes organic and inorganic growth and optimization. We expect organic growth through new products and positioning our portfolio to continue to transition to the higher end of our target markets. We also intend to advance the business through acquisitions, and investments in technology, facilities and equipment. We are implementing optimization initiatives throughout the Company to further improve efficiency, productivity and profitability. We will deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, share repurchases or debt repayment depending on what we deem appropriate based on market conditions, shareholder value creation and long term business objectives.\nRaw materials costs continued to increase through the majority of 2018, putting pressure on gross margin. Over the long term, we are confident in our ability to offset such increases with reformulated compounds, new product innovations, pricing initiatives and optimization efforts. We believe that, when taken as a whole, raw material prices have now peaked and are decreasing.\nWe perceive a degree of macro-economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth in the outlook for 2019 across several industries. We expect demand will continue for our technology-driven functional coatings and color solutions in the niche markets we focus on, and that we will continue to develop innovative new products. We have identified a number of optimization opportunities in our manufacturing and logistics operations and will continue to implement strategic optimization initiatives.\nForeign currency rates may continue to be volatile through 2019 and changes in interest rates could adversely impact reported results. We expect cash flow from operating activities to continue to be positive for 2019, providing additional liquidity.\nFactors that could adversely affect our future performance include those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017.

million higher in 2018 compared with the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year were primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses. The decrease in incentive compensation is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared to the prior year and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as decreases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table

The increase was partially offset by an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that were taken out of service in 2017, which didn't occur in 2018.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>24,337 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>32.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of bank fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,577 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,496 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest swap amortization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(762) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(762) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest capitalization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,696) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(79) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,617) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>33,371 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,754 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,617 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense in 2018 increased $5.6 million compared with 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2018, compared with 2017, partially offset by increased interest capitalization during 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $23.0 million, or 22.2 % of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $7.9 million net expense related to foreign tax rate differences, $3.5 million net expense resulting from foreign income tax audit settlements, $5.7 million net benefit related to tax credits and $4.1 million net benefit related to the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year or which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years of operating profits. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. The Tax Act contains many provisions which continue to be clarified through new regulations. Consistent with the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d), we completed our analysis within 2018 consistent with the guidance of SAB 118 and our initial determination of no tax due on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits was unchanged from our position at December 31, 2017.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, income from continuing operations was $57.8 million, compared with income from continuing operations of $44.6 million in 2016.

As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 80 basis points from 19.8% in 2016 to 19.0% in 2017. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year are primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses, business development expenses and accounted for the entire increase in intangible asset amortization. The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as increases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table presents SG&A expenses attributable to sales, research and development, and operations costs as strategic services and presents other SG&A costs as

and impairment charges decreased by $4.5 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to an impairment charge in 2016 within our Tile Coating Systems reporting unit, a component of the Performance Coatings operating segment of $13.2 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase due to an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that have been taken out of service, as well as actions taken in connection with recent acquisitions designed to achieve our targeted synergies.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>24,337 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,246 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,091 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of bank fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,496 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,143 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>158.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest capitalization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(79) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(52) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(27) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>51.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,754 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>21,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>6,207 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>28.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nInterest expense in 2017 increased $6.2 million compared with 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2017, compared with 2016 and an increase of the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility, partially offset by a favorable average borrowing rate as a result of the refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. Accordingly, we have assessed the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits and have preliminarily determined no tax is due.\nAdditional provisions of the Tax Act which may have an impact to the Company include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the domestic production deduction, limitations on interest expense, accelerated depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property, provisions related to performance-based executive compensation and international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations.\nWe have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the Tax Act under the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2017, that are identified within a subsequent measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date will be included as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period the amounts are determined.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $17.9 million, or 28.6% of income before income taxes in 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences. The 2016 effective tax rate is less than the statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million net benefit related to greater levels of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions, $4.8 million net benefit for the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year, $2.0 million in net benefit for the release of valuation allowance, which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years operating profits, $1.8 million benefit related to notional interest deductions, $2.8 million benefit for the generation of tax credits offset by a $4.1 expense related to the impairment of book basis goodwill and a $2.1 million expense related to non-deductible expenses.\nResults

and increases in sales of frits and glazes, digital inks and porcelain enamel of $14.9 million, $8.0 million and, $5.2 million, respectively.

Gross profit increased $19.9 million from the prior-year, primarily driven by favorable product pricing impacts of $27.1 million, gross profit from acquisitions of $28.0 million, favorable foreign currency impacts of $1.7 million and lower manufacturing costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $37.0 million and lower sales volume and mix of $0.8 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment net sales by Region\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>475,435 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>346,199 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,236 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLatin America\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>100,818 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>106,640 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,822) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>108,623 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>94,722 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,901 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited States\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>49,050 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>46,468 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,582 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>733,926 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>594,029 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>139,897 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe net sales increase of $139.9 million was primarily driven by increases in sales from EMEA and Asia Pacific.

Gross profit increased from the prior year, primarily due to higher product pricing of $11.5 million, favorable sales volume and mix of $8.7 million, gross profit from acquisitions of $1.3 million and favorable foreign currency impacts of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $10.4 million and higher manufacturing costs of $1.2 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment net sales by Region\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited States\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>172,901 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,171 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>142,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>134,122 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,980 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>41,642 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36,343 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,299 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLatin America\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34,382 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>32,865 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,517 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>391,027 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>358,060 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,967 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe net sales increase of $33.0 million was driven by higher sales from all regions.

After reductions for outstanding letters of credit secured by these facilities, we had $317.3 million of additional borrowings available under the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2017.\nIn conjunction with the refinancing of the Credit Facility, we recorded a charge of $3.2 million in connection with the write-off of unamortized issuance costs, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2014 Credit Facility\nIn 2014, the Company entered into a credit facility that was amended on January 25, 2016, and August 29, 2016, resulting in a $400 million secured revolving line of credit with a term of five years and a $300 million secured term loan facility with a term of seven years from the original issuance date (the 2014 Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders that was replaced on February 14, 2017, by the Credit Facility (as defined above).\nIn conjunction with the refinancing of the 2014 Credit Facility, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million in connection with the write-off of unamortized issuance costs, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nConsignment and Customer Arrangements for Precious Metals. We use precious metals, primarily silver, in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements. The financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. These fees were $2.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of $55.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $37.7 million at December 31, 2017, measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short-term commitments that typically mature within 30 to 90 days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity. On occasion, we have been required to deliver cash collateral. While no deposits were outstanding at December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017, we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment and the amount of collateral-free lines provided by the financial institutions. The amount of cash collateral required is subject to review by the financial institutions and can be changed at any time at their discretion, based in part on their assessment of our creditworthiness.\nInternational Receivable Sales Programs\nWe have several international programs to sell without recourse trade accounts receivable to financial institutions. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. The Company continues to service the receivables sold in exchange for a fee. The program, whose maximum capacity is 100 million Euro, is scheduled to expire in December 2023. At December 31, 2018 the outstanding principal amount of receivables sold under this program was $71.3 million. The carrying amount of deferred purchase price was $23.0 million and is recorded in Other Receivables.\nBank Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled $6.7 million. These agreements primarily relate to Ferro's insurance programs, foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments.\nOther Financing Arrangements\nWe maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for Ferro's short-term liquidity requirements. These facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled $41.4 million at December 31, 2018. We had $30.3 million of additional borrowings available under these lines at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, available lines of credit under the Amended Credit Facility, and cash flows from operating activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $104.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash generated in the U.S. is generally used to pay down amounts outstanding under our 2018 Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. If needed, we could repatriate the majority of cash held by foreign subsidiaries without the need to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes. We do not anticipate a liquidity need requiring such repatriation of these funds to the U.S.\nOur liquidity requirements primarily include debt service, purchase commitments, labor costs, working capital requirements, restructuring expenditures, acquisition costs, capital investments, precious metals cash collateral requirements, and postretirement benefit obligations. We expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs. In 2018, cash flows from operating activities were used to fund our investing activities. Additionally, we used the borrowings available under the Amended Credit Facility to fund acquisitions and for other general business purposes. We had additional borrowing capacity of $525.6 million at December 31, 2018, available under various credit facilities, primarily our revolving credit facility.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including those described in more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These covenants include customary restrictions, including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions, and limitations on certain types of investments. Specific to the 2018 Revolving Facility, we are subject to a financial covenant regarding the Company's maximum leverage ratio. This covenant under our Amended Credit Facility restricts the amount of our borrowings, reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfacility is described in more detail in Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d under Item 7 and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x as our actual ratio was 2.60, providing $116.9 million of EBITDA cushion on the leverage ratio, as defined within the Amended Credit Facility. To the extent that economic conditions in key markets deteriorate or we are unable to meet our business projections and EBITDA falls below approximately $184 million for a rolling four quarters, based on reasonably consistent net debt levels with those as of December 31, 2018, we could become unable to maintain compliance with our leverage ratio covenant. In such case, our lenders could demand immediate payment of outstanding amounts and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nDifficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit, forward contracts, and precious metals program. These counterparties are major, reputable, multinational institutions, all having investment-grade credit ratings. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counterparty default. However, an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nWe assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses, as well as our financial and capital structure, to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives. As part of this process, from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and, where appropriate, pursue the sale of such businesses and assets. We also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position such as the acquisitions we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Generally, we publicly announce material divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into a material definitive agreement or closed on those transactions.\nThe Company's aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

We consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: 1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period, we review material sales contracts for proper cut-off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country. For sales of products containing precious metals, we report revenues on a gross basis along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit. We record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions into which we enter.\nRestructuring and Cost Reduction Programs\nIn recent years, we have developed and initiated global cost reduction programs with the objectives of leveraging our global scale, realigning and lowering our cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. Management continues to evaluate our businesses, and therefore, there may be additional provisions for new optimization and cost-savings initiatives, as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded, as payments are made or actions are completed.\nRestructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns. We estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service, contract provisions, local legal requirements, projected final service dates, and salary levels. We also analyze the carrying value of long-lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment. In all likelihood, this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease. While we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely, the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions. Changes in our estimates could increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Other events, such as negotiations with unions and works councils, may also delay the resulting cost savings.\nAccounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nFerro sells its products to customers in diversified industries throughout the world. No customer or related group of customers represents greater than 10% of net sales or accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and require collateral principally for export sales, when industry practices allow and as market conditions dictate, subject to our ability to negotiate secured terms relative to competitive offers. We regularly analyze significant customer accounts and provide for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience, customer payment history, the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, economic conditions, and specific circumstances, as appropriate. Changes in these factors could result in additional allowances. Customer accounts we conclude to be uncollectible or to require excessive collection costs are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, write-offs of uncollectible accounts have been within our expectations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment each year using a measurement date of October 31st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator. We annually, or more frequently as warranted, evaluate the appropriateness of our reporting units utilizing operating segments as the starting point of our analysis. In the event of a change in our reporting units, we would allocate goodwill based on the relative fair value. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting units' fair values, unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate more representative fair values. The income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting units over their useful lives and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting units. We use historical results, trends and our projections of market growth, internal sales efforts and anticipated cost structure assumptions to estimate future cash flows. Using a risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital, we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date. The market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be paid by a market participant in the purchase of similar businesses. If the fair value of any reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value, we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets and liabilities to determine the amount of any impairment.\nThe significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analyses of goodwill at October 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSignificant Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted-average cost of capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0% - 14.75\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n11.0% - 13.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidual growth rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOur estimates of fair value can be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our reporting units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in cost structure could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill. Additionally, an increase in inflation, interest rates or the risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill.\nBased on our 2018 annual impairment test performed as of October 31, 2018, the fair values of the reporting units tested for impairment exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from 21.3% to 206.7% at the 2018 measurement date. The lowest cushion relates to goodwill associated with the Performance Coatings reportable segment, which had a goodwill balance of $44.4 million at December 31, 2018. A future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results are materially less than forecasted results. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and, as a result, not support the carrying values of our reporting units are: new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process, thereby reducing operating margins; new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment or manufacturing processes; and substantial downturns in economic conditions.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nThe Company's long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. We review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAn adverse change in the business climate of a long-lived asset or asset group;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAn adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is used or in its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCurrent operating losses for a long-lived asset or asset group combined with a history of such losses or projected or forecasted losses that demonstrate that the losses will continue; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise significantly disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. In the event of impairment, we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value over fair value. The long-term nature of these assets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of review.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. The final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors, including existing income tax laws and regulations, negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation, and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international income tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset tax liabilities, as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate tax where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist. In evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets, we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, and forecasted income.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more-likely-than-not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and precious metal prices. The accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment. Generally, the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex, and observable market-based inputs are available to measure their fair value. We do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes. The use of financial derivatives is managed under a policy that identifies the conditions necessary to identify the transaction as a financial derivative. Financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We enter into these derivative financial instruments with major, reputable, multinational financial institutions. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counter-party default. We continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective. In the event the hedge becomes ineffective, we discontinue hedge treatment. Except as noted below, we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks.\nOur exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable interest rates. To reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nWe have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to minimize our exposure to floating rate debt agreements denominated in a currency other than functional currency. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense as the interest on the debt is accrued. These swaps are designated as cash flows hedges and we mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nTo help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations against adverse changes in exchange rates, the Company uses non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as cumulative translation adjustments (a component of other comprehensive income).\nWe manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade. Our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows. Our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the Egyptian Pound, the Turkish Lira, the Taiwan Dollar, the Colombian Peso, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee, the Thailand Baht, the Indonesian Rupiah, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Renminbi and the Romanian Leu. We mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions.\nPrecious metals (primarily silver, gold, platinum and palladium) represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronics products. When we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer's request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order, we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content. Our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nWe also purchase portions of our energy requirements, including natural gas and electricity, under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes. Our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nTransfer of Financial Assets\nThe Company accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when it has surrendered control over the related assets. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other things, an evaluation of relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe sponsor defined benefit plans in the U.S. and many countries outside the U.S., and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the U.S. The U.S. pension plans and retiree medical plans represent approximately 86% of pension plan assets, 72% of benefit obligations and 56% of net periodic pension expense as of December 31, 2018.\nThe assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs. We meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs.\nWe determine the discount rate for the U.S. pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model. Using the pension plans' projected cash flows, the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield. These portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of AA or better under either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Rating Group, but exclude certain bonds, such as callable bonds, bonds with small amounts outstanding, and bonds with unusually high or low yields. The discount rates for the non-U.S. plans are based on a yield curve method, using AA-rated bonds applicable in their respective capital markets. The duration of each plan's liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration.\nFor the market-related value of plan assets, we use fair value, rather than a calculated value. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years. We calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted-average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans. In determining the expected returns, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return. The Company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions. Our target asset allocation percentages are 35% fixed income, 60% equity, and 5% other investments for U.S. plans and 75% fixed income, 24% equity, and 1% other investments for non-U.S. plans. In 2018, our pension plan assets incurred losses of approximately\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n7% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. In 2017, investment returns on average plan assets were approximately 16% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company's pension plans.\nAll other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans.\nThe following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans, including a U.S. nonqualified retirement plan, and the retiree medical plan to a 25-basis-point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

million in 2017. The change is mainly the result of mark to market actuarial net losses in 2018.\nFor 2019, assuming expected returns on plan assets and no actuarial gains or losses, we expect our overall net periodic benefit expense to be approximately $3.8 million, compared with income of approximately $0.2 million in 2018 on a comparable basis.\nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined utilizing the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age, but also upon assumptions of future usage in production, customer demand and market conditions. Inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods. If actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories, additional write-downs may be required. Slow moving, excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials, and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they are located. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. We expense these recurring costs as they are incurred. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe also accrue for environmental remediation costs and other obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount. We determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions and other circumstances, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies. We adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.\nImpact of Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.",
    "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales increased $215.7 million, or 15.4%, compared with 2017. The increase was driven by higher sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $139.9 million, $42.8 million and $33.0 million, respectively. Gross profit increased $39.7 million compared with 2017. The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases across all of our segments, with increases in Performance Coatings, Color Solutions and Performance Colors and Glass and of $19.9 million, $11.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit rate decreased approximately 150 basis points to 28.3%, from 29.8% in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $13.1 million, or 5.0%, compared with 2017. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017, and net income attributable to common shareholders was $80.1 million, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $57.1 million in 2017.\nAs previously disclosed on January 17, 2019, the Company is in the process of expanding its production facility in Villagran, Mexico, which will become the Company's Manufacturing Center of Excellence for the Americas. The expansion of the Villagran facility is expected to significantly increase the revenue generated from products manufactured at that facility. With the expanded capacity in Villagran, the Company (i) will discontinue the production of glass enamels, other industrial specialty products, such as architectural glass coatings, and pigments at its Washington, Pennsylvania facility over the course of 2019 and into 2020, (ii) plans to discontinue production of porcelain enamel products at its Cleveland, Ohio facility and (iii) will close additional facilities in Latin America. As part of this optimization initiative, the Company is expanding its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. Conductive glass coatings production will be discontinued at the Washington, Pennsylvania facility and will be produced at the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility, and the Company's operations at its Vista, California facility will be transferred to the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. In addition, the Company will be moving its Americas research and development center for glass products to its technology center in Independence, Ohio, where the Company is investing in expanded laboratory facilities. The Washington, Pennsylvania facility is expected to remain in operation until sometime in 2020. Production of specialty glasses for electronics applications will continue at the Cleveland, Ohio facility, and the Company will invest in the facility to equip it to serve as a logistics center. The Cleveland, Ohio facility also will serve as the Americas research and development center for the porcelain enamel business.\n\ufeff\n2018 Transactional Activity\nTransactions undertaken in 2018 included the following business acquisitions:\nAcquisition of Quimicer, S.A.

We continue to execute the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of our value creation strategy, which includes organic and inorganic growth and optimization. We expect organic growth through new products and positioning our portfolio to continue to transition to the higher end of our target markets. We also intend to advance the business through acquisitions, and investments in technology, facilities and equipment. We are implementing optimization initiatives throughout the Company to further improve efficiency, productivity and profitability. We will deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, share repurchases or debt repayment depending on what we deem appropriate based on market conditions, shareholder value creation and long term business objectives.\nRaw materials costs continued to increase through the majority of 2018, putting pressure on gross margin. Over the long term, we are confident in our ability to offset such increases with reformulated compounds, new product innovations, pricing initiatives and optimization efforts. We believe that, when taken as a whole, raw material prices have now peaked and are decreasing.\nWe perceive a degree of macro-economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth in the outlook for 2019 across several industries. We expect demand will continue for our technology-driven functional coatings and color solutions in the niche markets we focus on, and that we will continue to develop innovative new products. We have identified a number of optimization opportunities in our manufacturing and logistics operations and will continue to implement strategic optimization initiatives.\nForeign currency rates may continue to be volatile through 2019 and changes in interest rates could adversely impact reported results. We expect cash flow from operating activities to continue to be positive for 2019, providing additional liquidity.\nFactors that could adversely affect our future performance include those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017.

million higher in 2018 compared with the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year were primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses. The decrease in incentive compensation is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared to the prior year and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as decreases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table

The increase was partially offset by an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that were taken out of service in 2017, which didn't occur in 2018.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>24,337 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>32.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of bank fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,577 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,496 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>81 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest swap amortization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(762) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(762) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest capitalization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,696) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(79) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,617) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>33,371 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,754 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,617 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense in 2018 increased $5.6 million compared with 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2018, compared with 2017, partially offset by increased interest capitalization during 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $23.0 million, or 22.2 % of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $7.9 million net expense related to foreign tax rate differences, $3.5 million net expense resulting from foreign income tax audit settlements, $5.7 million net benefit related to tax credits and $4.1 million net benefit related to the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year or which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years of operating profits. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. The Tax Act contains many provisions which continue to be clarified through new regulations. Consistent with the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d), we completed our analysis within 2018 consistent with the guidance of SAB 118 and our initial determination of no tax due on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits was unchanged from our position at December 31, 2017.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, income from continuing operations was $57.8 million, compared with income from continuing operations of $44.6 million in 2016.

As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 80 basis points from 19.8% in 2016 to 19.0% in 2017. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year are primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses, business development expenses and accounted for the entire increase in intangible asset amortization. The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as increases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table presents SG&A expenses attributable to sales, research and development, and operations costs as strategic services and presents other SG&A costs as

and impairment charges decreased by $4.5 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to an impairment charge in 2016 within our Tile Coating Systems reporting unit, a component of the Performance Coatings operating segment of $13.2 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase due to an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that have been taken out of service, as well as actions taken in connection with recent acquisitions designed to achieve our targeted synergies.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>24,337 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>20,246 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,091 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of bank fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,496 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,143 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>158.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest capitalization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(79) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(52) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(27) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>51.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,754 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>21,547 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>6,207 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>28.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nInterest expense in 2017 increased $6.2 million compared with 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2017, compared with 2016 and an increase of the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility, partially offset by a favorable average borrowing rate as a result of the refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. Accordingly, we have assessed the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits and have preliminarily determined no tax is due.\nAdditional provisions of the Tax Act which may have an impact to the Company include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the domestic production deduction, limitations on interest expense, accelerated depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property, provisions related to performance-based executive compensation and international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations.\nWe have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the Tax Act under the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2017, that are identified within a subsequent measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date will be included as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period the amounts are determined.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $17.9 million, or 28.6% of income before income taxes in 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences. The 2016 effective tax rate is less than the statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million net benefit related to greater levels of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions, $4.8 million net benefit for the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year, $2.0 million in net benefit for the release of valuation allowance, which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years operating profits, $1.8 million benefit related to notional interest deductions, $2.8 million benefit for the generation of tax credits offset by a $4.1 expense related to the impairment of book basis goodwill and a $2.1 million expense related to non-deductible expenses.\nResults

and increases in sales of frits and glazes, digital inks and porcelain enamel of $14.9 million, $8.0 million and, $5.2 million, respectively.

Gross profit increased $19.9 million from the prior-year, primarily driven by favorable product pricing impacts of $27.1 million, gross profit from acquisitions of $28.0 million, favorable foreign currency impacts of $1.7 million and lower manufacturing costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $37.0 million and lower sales volume and mix of $0.8 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment net sales by Region\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>475,435 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>346,199 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>129,236 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLatin America\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>100,818 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>106,640 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,822) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>108,623 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>94,722 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,901 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited States\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>49,050 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>46,468 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,582 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>733,926 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>594,029 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>139,897 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe net sales increase of $139.9 million was primarily driven by increases in sales from EMEA and Asia Pacific.

Gross profit increased from the prior year, primarily due to higher product pricing of $11.5 million, favorable sales volume and mix of $8.7 million, gross profit from acquisitions of $1.3 million and favorable foreign currency impacts of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $10.4 million and higher manufacturing costs of $1.2 million.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment net sales by Region\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited States\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>172,901 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154,730 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,171 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>142,102 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>134,122 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,980 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>41,642 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>36,343 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,299 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLatin America\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34,382 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>32,865 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,517 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>391,027 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>358,060 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,967 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe net sales increase of $33.0 million was driven by higher sales from all regions.

Cash flows from operating activities increased $98.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher cash inflows for net working capital of $68.5 million and other current assets and liabilities of $28.2 million.\nCash flows from operating activities increased $22.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings after consideration of non-cash items, partially offset by higher cash outflows for net working capital of $15.7 million and other current assets and liabilities of $38.1 million.\nInvesting activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased $30.4 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash outflows for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $56.2 million, partially offset by higher cash outflows for capital expenditures of $30.1 million.\nCash flows from investing activities decreased approximately $28.1 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher cash outflows for capital expenditures of $25.6 million.\nFinancing activities.

As further discussed in Note 9, during 2018, we paid off our Credit Facility and entered into our Amended Credit Facility, consisting of a $500 million secured revolving line of credit and $820 million secured term loan facilities. Further, compared to the prior year, purchase of treasury stock increased by $28.8 million.\nCash flows from financing activities increased $26.4 million in 2017 compared with 2016.

This transaction resulted in additional borrowings in 2017 of $53.6 million compared to 2016. Further, compared to 2016, net repayments under loans payable was $24.2 million higher. Additionally, during 2017, we paid debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility entered into during the period, partially offset by no repurchases of common stock being made during 2017.\nWe have paid no dividends on our common stock since 2009.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nMajor debt instruments that were outstanding during 2018 are described below.\nAmended Credit Facility\nOn April 25, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) to its existing credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) which Amended Credit Facility (a) provided a new revolving facility (the 2018 Revolving Facility\u201d), which replaced the Company's existing revolving facility, (b) repriced the ( Tranche B-1 Loans\u201d), (c) provided new tranches of term loans ( Tranche B-2 Loans\u201d and Tranche B-3 Loans\u201d) denominated in U.S. dollars and will be used for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.

We use precious metals, primarily silver, in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements. The financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. These fees were $2.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of $55.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $37.7 million at December 31, 2017, measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short-term commitments that typically mature within 30 to 90 days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity. On occasion, we have been required to deliver cash collateral. While no deposits were outstanding at December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017, we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment and the amount of collateral-free lines provided by the financial institutions. The amount of cash collateral required is subject to review by the financial institutions and can be changed at any time at their discretion, based in part on their assessment of our creditworthiness.\nInternational Receivable Sales Programs\nWe have several international programs to sell without recourse trade accounts receivable to financial institutions. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. The Company continues to service the receivables sold in exchange for a fee. The program, whose maximum capacity is 100 million Euro, is scheduled to expire in December 2023. At December 31, 2018 the outstanding principal amount of receivables sold under this program was $71.3 million. The carrying amount of deferred purchase price was $23.0 million and is recorded in Other Receivables.\nBank Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled $6.7 million. These agreements primarily relate to Ferro's insurance programs, foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments.\nOther Financing Arrangements\nWe maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for Ferro's short-term liquidity requirements. These facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled $41.4 million at December 31, 2018. We had $30.3 million of additional borrowings available under these lines at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, available lines of credit under the Amended Credit Facility, and cash flows from operating activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $104.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash generated in the U.S. is generally used to pay down amounts outstanding under our 2018 Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. If needed, we could repatriate the majority of cash held by foreign subsidiaries without the need to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes. We do not anticipate a liquidity need requiring such repatriation of these funds to the U.S.\nOur liquidity requirements primarily include debt service, purchase commitments, labor costs, working capital requirements, restructuring expenditures, acquisition costs, capital investments, precious metals cash collateral requirements, and postretirement benefit obligations. We expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs. In 2018, cash flows from operating activities were used to fund our investing activities. Additionally, we used the borrowings available under the Amended Credit Facility to fund acquisitions and for other general business purposes. We had additional borrowing capacity of $525.6 million at December 31, 2018, available under various credit facilities, primarily our revolving credit facility.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including those described in more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These covenants include customary restrictions, including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions, and limitations on certain types of investments. Specific to the 2018 Revolving Facility, we are subject to a financial covenant regarding the Company's maximum leverage ratio. This covenant under our Amended Credit Facility restricts the amount of our borrowings, reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfacility is described in more detail in Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d under Item 7 and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x as our actual ratio was 2.60, providing $116.9 million of EBITDA cushion on the leverage ratio, as defined within the Amended Credit Facility. To the extent that economic conditions in key markets deteriorate or we are unable to meet our business projections and EBITDA falls below approximately $184 million for a rolling four quarters, based on reasonably consistent net debt levels with those as of December 31, 2018, we could become unable to maintain compliance with our leverage ratio covenant. In such case, our lenders could demand immediate payment of outstanding amounts and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nDifficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit, forward contracts, and precious metals program. These counterparties are major, reputable, multinational institutions, all having investment-grade credit ratings. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counterparty default. However, an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nWe assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses, as well as our financial and capital structure, to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives. As part of this process, from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and, where appropriate, pursue the sale of such businesses and assets. We also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position such as the acquisitions we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Generally, we publicly announce material divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into a material definitive agreement or closed on those transactions.\nThe Company's aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

obligations and unamortized issuance costs on the term loan facility. \n (3) Interest represents only contractual payments for fixed-rate debt. \n (4) Purchase commitments are noncancelable contractual obligations for raw materials and energy, and exclude capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. \n (5) We have not projected payments past 2019 due to uncertainties in estimating the amount and period of any payments. The amount above relates to our current income tax liability as of December 31, 2018. We have $22.2 million in gross liabilities related to \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n unrecognized tax benefits, including $1.8 million of accrued interest and penalties that are not included in the above table since we cannot reasonably predict the timing of cash settlements with various taxing authorities. \n (6) The funding amounts are based on the minimum contributions required under our various plans and applicable regulations in each respective country. We have not projected contributions past 2020 due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nWhen we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes. We consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: 1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period, we review material sales contracts for proper cut-off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country. For sales of products containing precious metals, we report revenues on a gross basis along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit. We record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions into which we enter.\nRestructuring and Cost Reduction Programs\nIn recent years, we have developed and initiated global cost reduction programs with the objectives of leveraging our global scale, realigning and lowering our cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. Management continues to evaluate our businesses, and therefore, there may be additional provisions for new optimization and cost-savings initiatives, as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded, as payments are made or actions are completed.\nRestructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns. We estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service, contract provisions, local legal requirements, projected final service dates, and salary levels. We also analyze the carrying value of long-lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment. In all likelihood, this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease. While we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely, the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions. Changes in our estimates could increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Other events, such as negotiations with unions and works councils, may also delay the resulting cost savings.\nAccounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nFerro sells its products to customers in diversified industries throughout the world. No customer or related group of customers represents greater than 10% of net sales or accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and require collateral principally for export sales, when industry practices allow and as market conditions dictate, subject to our ability to negotiate secured terms relative to competitive offers. We regularly analyze significant customer accounts and provide for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience, customer payment history, the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, economic conditions, and specific circumstances, as appropriate. Changes in these factors could result in additional allowances. Customer accounts we conclude to be uncollectible or to require excessive collection costs are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, write-offs of uncollectible accounts have been within our expectations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment each year using a measurement date of October 31st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator. We annually, or more frequently as warranted, evaluate the appropriateness of our reporting units utilizing operating segments as the starting point of our analysis. In the event of a change in our reporting units, we would allocate goodwill based on the relative fair value. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting units' fair values, unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate more representative fair values. The income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting units over their useful lives and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting units. We use historical results, trends and our projections of market growth, internal sales efforts and anticipated cost structure assumptions to estimate future cash flows. Using a risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital, we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date. The market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be paid by a market participant in the purchase of similar businesses. If the fair value of any reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value, we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets and liabilities to determine the amount of any impairment.\nThe significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analyses of goodwill at October 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSignificant Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted-average cost of capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n13.0% - 14.75\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n11.0% - 13.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidual growth rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOur estimates of fair value can be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our reporting units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in cost structure could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill. Additionally, an increase in inflation, interest rates or the risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill.\nBased on our 2018 annual impairment test performed as of October 31, 2018, the fair values of the reporting units tested for impairment exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from 21.3% to 206.7% at the 2018 measurement date. The lowest cushion relates to goodwill associated with the Performance Coatings reportable segment, which had a goodwill balance of $44.4 million at December 31, 2018. A future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results are materially less than forecasted results. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and, as a result, not support the carrying values of our reporting units are: new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process, thereby reducing operating margins; new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment or manufacturing processes; and substantial downturns in economic conditions.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nThe Company's long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. We review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances:\n \u00b7 An adverse change in the business climate of a long-lived asset or asset group; \n \u00b7 An adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is used or in its physical condition; \n \u00b7 Current operating losses for a long-lived asset or asset group combined with a history of such losses or projected or forecasted losses that demonstrate that the losses will continue; or \n \u00b7 A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise significantly disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. \nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. In the event of impairment, we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value over fair value. The long-term nature of these assets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of review.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. The final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors, including existing income tax laws and regulations, negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation, and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international income tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset tax liabilities, as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate tax where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist. In evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets, we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, and forecasted income.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more-likely-than-not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and precious metal prices. The accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment. Generally, the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex, and observable market-based inputs are available to measure their fair value. We do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes. The use of financial derivatives is managed under a policy that identifies the conditions necessary to identify the transaction as a financial derivative. Financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We enter into these derivative financial instruments with major, reputable, multinational financial institutions. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counter-party default. We continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective. In the event the hedge becomes ineffective, we discontinue hedge treatment. Except as noted below, we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks.\nOur exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable interest rates. To reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nWe have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to minimize our exposure to floating rate debt agreements denominated in a currency other than functional currency. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense as the interest on the debt is accrued. These swaps are designated as cash flows hedges and we mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nTo help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations against adverse changes in exchange rates, the Company uses non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as cumulative translation adjustments (a component of other comprehensive income).\nWe manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade. Our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows. Our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the Egyptian Pound, the Turkish Lira, the Taiwan Dollar, the Colombian Peso, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee, the Thailand Baht, the Indonesian Rupiah, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Renminbi and the Romanian Leu. We mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions.\nPrecious metals (primarily silver, gold, platinum and palladium) represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronics products. When we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer's request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order, we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content. Our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nWe also purchase portions of our energy requirements, including natural gas and electricity, under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes. Our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nTransfer of Financial Assets\nThe Company accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when it has surrendered control over the related assets. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other things, an evaluation of relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe sponsor defined benefit plans in the U.S. and many countries outside the U.S., and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the U.S. The U.S. pension plans and retiree medical plans represent approximately 86% of pension plan assets, 72% of benefit obligations and 56% of net periodic pension expense as of December 31, 2018.\nThe assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs. We meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs.\nWe determine the discount rate for the U.S. pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model. Using the pension plans' projected cash flows, the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield. These portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of AA or better under either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Rating Group, but exclude certain bonds, such as callable bonds, bonds with small amounts outstanding, and bonds with unusually high or low yields. The discount rates for the non-U.S. plans are based on a yield curve method, using AA-rated bonds applicable in their respective capital markets. The duration of each plan's liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration.\nFor the market-related value of plan assets, we use fair value, rather than a calculated value. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years. We calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted-average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans. In determining the expected returns, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return. The Company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions. Our target asset allocation percentages are 35% fixed income, 60% equity, and 5% other investments for U.S. plans and 75% fixed income, 24% equity, and 1% other investments for non-U.S. plans. In 2018, our pension plan assets incurred losses of approximately\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n7% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. In 2017, investment returns on average plan assets were approximately 16% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company's pension plans.\nAll other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans.\nThe following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans, including a U.S. nonqualified retirement plan, and the retiree medical plan to a 25-basis-point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

million in 2017. The change is mainly the result of mark to market actuarial net losses in 2018.\nFor 2019, assuming expected returns on plan assets and no actuarial gains or losses, we expect our overall net periodic benefit expense to be approximately $3.8 million, compared with income of approximately $0.2 million in 2018 on a comparable basis.\nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined utilizing the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age, but also upon assumptions of future usage in production, customer demand and market conditions. Inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods. If actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories, additional write-downs may be required. Slow moving, excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials, and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they are located. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. We expense these recurring costs as they are incurred. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe also accrue for environmental remediation costs and other obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount. We determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions and other circumstances, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies. We adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.\nImpact of Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.",
    "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales increased $215.7 million, or 15.4%, compared with 2017. The increase was driven by higher sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $139.9 million, $42.8 million and $33.0 million, respectively. Gross profit increased $39.7 million compared with 2017. The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases across all of our segments, with increases in Performance Coatings, Color Solutions and Performance Colors and Glass and of $19.9 million, $11.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit rate decreased approximately 150 basis points to 28.3%, from 29.8% in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $13.1 million, or 5.0%, compared with 2017. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017, and net income attributable to common shareholders was $80.1 million, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $57.1 million in 2017.\nAs previously disclosed on January 17, 2019, the Company is in the process of expanding its production facility in Villagran, Mexico, which will become the Company's Manufacturing Center of Excellence for the Americas. The expansion of the Villagran facility is expected to significantly increase the revenue generated from products manufactured at that facility. With the expanded capacity in Villagran, the Company (i) will discontinue the production of glass enamels, other industrial specialty products, such as architectural glass coatings, and pigments at its Washington, Pennsylvania facility over the course of 2019 and into 2020, (ii) plans to discontinue production of porcelain enamel products at its Cleveland, Ohio facility and (iii) will close additional facilities in Latin America. As part of this optimization initiative, the Company is expanding its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. Conductive glass coatings production will be discontinued at the Washington, Pennsylvania facility and will be produced at the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility, and the Company's operations at its Vista, California facility will be transferred to the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility. In addition, the Company will be moving its Americas research and development center for glass products to its technology center in Independence, Ohio, where the Company is investing in expanded laboratory facilities. The Washington, Pennsylvania facility is expected to remain in operation until sometime in 2020. Production of specialty glasses for electronics applications will continue at the Cleveland, Ohio facility, and the Company will invest in the facility to equip it to serve as a logistics center.

We continue to execute the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of our value creation strategy, which includes organic and inorganic growth and optimization. We expect organic growth through new products and positioning our portfolio to continue to transition to the higher end of our target markets. We also intend to advance the business through acquisitions, and investments in technology, facilities and equipment. We are implementing optimization initiatives throughout the Company to further improve efficiency, productivity and profitability. We will deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, share repurchases or debt repayment depending on what we deem appropriate based on market conditions, shareholder value creation and long term business objectives.\nRaw materials costs continued to increase through the majority of 2018, putting pressure on gross margin. Over the long term, we are confident in our ability to offset such increases with reformulated compounds, new product innovations, pricing initiatives and optimization efforts. We believe that, when taken as a whole, raw material prices have now peaked and are decreasing.\nWe perceive a degree of macro-economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth in the outlook for 2019 across several industries. We expect demand will continue for our technology-driven functional coatings and color solutions in the niche markets we focus on, and that we will continue to develop innovative new products. We have identified a number of optimization opportunities in our manufacturing and logistics operations and will continue to implement strategic optimization initiatives.\nForeign currency rates may continue to be volatile through 2019 and changes in interest rates could adversely impact reported results. We expect cash flow from operating activities to continue to be positive for 2019, providing additional liquidity.\nFactors that could adversely affect our future performance include those described under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $80.9 million, compared with net income of $57.8 million in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to common shareholders was $80.1 million, or $0.95 earnings per share, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $57.1 million, or $0.68 earnings per share in 2017.\nNet Sales\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet sales increased by $215.7 million, or 15.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the prior year, with increased sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $139.9 million, $42.8 million and $33.0 million, respectively. The increase in net sales was driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. Organic sales increased in Performance Coatings by $28.2 million, Color Solutions by $28.1 million, and Performance Colors and Glass by $22.6 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $39.7 million, or 9.5%, in 2018 to $455.9 million, compared with $416.2 million in 2017 and, as a percentage of net sales, it decreased 150 basis points to 28.3%. The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases across all of our segments, with increases in Performance Coatings, Color Solutions and Performance Colors and Glass of $19.9 million, $11.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to favorable product pricing of $43.1 million, gross profit from acquisitions of $34.1 million, higher sales volumes and mix of $7.5 million, favorable foreign currency impacts of $5.3 million and lower manufacturing and product costs of $2.8 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $51.8 million.\nGeographic Revenues\nThe following table presents our sales on the basis of where sales originated.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe increase in net sales of $215.7 million, compared with 2017, was driven by higher sales from EMEA, Asia Pacific and the United States, partially offset by a decrease in sales in Latin America. The increase in sales from EMEA was attributable to higher sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $129.2 million, $32.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The increase in sales from Asia Pacific was attributable to higher sales in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $13.9 million, $6.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The increase in sales from the United States was attributable to higher sales in Color Solutions, Performance Colors and Glass and Performance Coatings of $18.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The decrease in sales from Latin America was attributable to lower sales in Performance Coatings\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nof $5.8 million, partially mitigated by higher sales in Performance Colors and Glass and Color Solutions of $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents our sales on the basis of where sold products were shipped.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table includes SG&A components with significant changes between 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\n\nSG&A expenses were $13.1 million higher in 2018 compared with the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 170 basis points from 19.0% in 2017 to 17.3% in 2018. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year were primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses. The decrease in incentive compensation is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared to the prior year and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as decreases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table presents SG&A expenses attributable to sales, research and development, and operations costs as strategic services and presents other SG&A costs as functional services.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges increased $1.9 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily related to costs associated with integration of recent acquisitions and optimization programs. The increase was partially offset by an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that were taken out of service in 2017, which didn't occur in 2018.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\n\nInterest expense in 2018 increased $5.6 million compared with 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2018, compared with 2017, partially offset by increased interest capitalization during 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $23.0 million, or 22.2 % of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $7.9 million net expense related to foreign tax rate differences, $3.5 million net expense resulting from foreign income tax audit settlements, $5.7 million net benefit related to tax credits and $4.1 million net benefit related to the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year or which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years of operating profits. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. The Tax Act contains many provisions which continue to be clarified through new regulations. Consistent with the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d), we completed our analysis within 2018 consistent with the guidance of SAB 118 and our initial determination of no tax due on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits was unchanged from our position at December 31, 2017.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, income from continuing operations was $57.8 million, compared with income from continuing operations of $44.6 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $57.8 million, compared with net loss of $19.9 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common shareholders was $57.1 million, or $0.68 earnings per share, compared with net loss attributable to common shareholders of $20.8 million, or $0.25 loss per share in 2016.\nNet Sales\n\ufeff\n\nNet sales increased by $251.5 million, or 22.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the prior year, with increased sales in Color Solutions, Performance Colors and Glass and Performance Coatings of $111.2 million, $73.2 million and $67.0 million, respectively. The increase in net sales was driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. Organic sales increased in Color Solutions by $39.6 million, Performance Coatings by $24.1 million and Performance Colors and Glass by $11.8 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $59.8 million, or 16.8%, in 2017 to $416.2 million, compared with $356.4 million in 2016 and, as a percentage of net sales, it decreased 130 basis points to 29.8%. The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases across all of our segments, with increases in Color Solutions, Performance Colors and Glass and Performance Coatings of $29.2 million, $23.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to acquisitions of $46.9 million, lower manufacturing and product costs of $28.8 million, driven by higher volume and mix, as well as strategic purchasing actions, favorable product pricing of $12.9 million, higher sales volumes and mix of $9.5 million, favorable foreign currency impacts of $0.3 million, partially offset by higher raw material costs of $39.3 million.\nGeographic Revenues\nThe following table presents our sales on the basis of where sales originated.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe increase in net sales of $251.5 million, compared with 2016, was driven by higher sales from all regions. The increase in sales from EMEA was attributable to higher sales in Color Solutions, Performance Coatings and Performance Colors and Glass of $69.3 million, $56.4 million and $42.8 million, respectively. The increase in sales from the United States was primarily attributable to higher sales in Color Solutions and Performance Colors and Glass of $33.0 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The increase in sales from Latin America and Asia Pacific was attributable to higher sales across all segments.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following table presents our sales on the basis of where sold products were shipped.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table includes SG&A components with significant changes between 2017 and 2016.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSG&A expenses were $38.1 million higher in 2017 compared with the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 80 basis points from 19.8% in 2016 to 19.0% in 2017. The higher SG&A expenses compared with the prior year are primarily driven by businesses acquired within the last year. The acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase in personnel expenses, business development expenses and accounted for the entire increase in intangible asset amortization. The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million is the result of the Company's performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior year, as well as increases in the Company's stock price.\nThe following table presents SG&A expenses attributable to sales, research and development, and operations costs as strategic services and presents other SG&A costs as functional services.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and impairment charges decreased by $4.5 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to an impairment charge in 2016 within our Tile Coating Systems reporting unit, a component of the Performance Coatings operating segment of $13.2 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase due to an other than temporary impairment\u201d charge on an equity method investment of $1.6 million and costs associated with a restructuring plan in Italy, which includes $1.2 million of asset impairment associated with assets that have been taken out of service, as well as actions taken in connection with recent acquisitions designed to achieve our targeted synergies.\nInterest Expense\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nInterest expense in 2017 increased $6.2 million compared with 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average long-term debt balance during 2017, compared with 2016 and an increase of the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility, partially offset by a favorable average borrowing rate as a result of the refinancing completed in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the reduction in the federal statutory rate, resulting in a $21.5 million increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also changed the U.S. taxation of worldwide income. Accordingly, we have assessed the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits and have preliminarily determined no tax is due.\nAdditional provisions of the Tax Act which may have an impact to the Company include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the domestic production deduction, limitations on interest expense, accelerated depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property, provisions related to performance-based executive compensation and international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations.\nWe have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the Tax Act under the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2017, that are identified within a subsequent measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date will be included as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period the amounts are determined.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $52.8 million, or 47.7% of income before income taxes, compared to an income tax expense of $17.9 million, or 28.6% of income before income taxes in 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate is greater than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a net effect of a $21.5 million expense related to re-measuring the U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, $5.6 million net expense related to uncertain tax positions and $8.0 million benefit related to foreign tax rate differences. The 2016 effective tax rate is less than the statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million net benefit related to greater levels of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions, $4.8 million net benefit for the release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets that were utilized in the current year, $2.0 million in net benefit for the release of valuation allowance, which are deemed no longer necessary based upon changes in the current and expected future years operating profits, $1.8 million benefit related to notional interest deductions, $2.8 million benefit for the generation of tax credits offset by a $4.1 expense related to the impairment of book basis goodwill and a $2.1 million expense related to non-deductible expenses.\nResults of Operations - Segment Information\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nPerformance Coatings\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet sales increased in Performance Coatings by $139.9 million compared with the prior year, primarily from sales of Endeka of $89.0 million, SPC of $10.1 million, Quimicer of $7.4 million and Gardenia of $3.3 million, and increases in sales of frits and glazes, digital inks and porcelain enamel of $14.9 million, $8.0 million and, $5.2 million, respectively.

Cash flows from financing activities decreased $99.0 million in 2018 compared with 2017. As further discussed in Note 9, during 2018, we paid off our Credit Facility and entered into our Amended Credit Facility, consisting of a $500 million secured revolving line of credit and $820 million secured term loan facilities. Further, compared to the prior year, purchase of treasury stock increased by $28.8 million.\nCash flows from financing activities increased $26.4 million in 2017 compared with 2016. As further discussed in Note 9, we paid off our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into our new Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million secured revolving line of credit,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\na $357.5 million secured term loan facility and a \u20ac250 million secured euro term loan facility. This transaction resulted in additional borrowings in 2017 of $53.6 million compared to 2016. Further, compared to 2016, net repayments under loans payable was $24.2 million higher. Additionally, during 2017, we paid debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility entered into during the period, partially offset by no repurchases of common stock being made during 2017.\nWe have paid no dividends on our common stock since 2009.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nMajor debt instruments that were outstanding during 2018 are described below.\nAmended Credit Facility\nOn April 25, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) to its existing credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) which Amended Credit Facility (a) provided a new revolving facility (the 2018 Revolving Facility\u201d), which replaced the Company's existing revolving facility, (b) repriced the ( Tranche B-1 Loans\u201d), (c) provided new tranches of term loans ( Tranche B-2 Loans\u201d and Tranche B-3 Loans\u201d) denominated in U.S. dollars and will be used for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. The Tranche B-2 Loans are borrowed by the Company and the Tranche B-3 Loans are borrowed on a joint and several basis by Ferro GmbH and Ferro Europe Holdings LLC.\nThe Amended Credit Facility consists of a $500 million secured revolving line of credit with a maturity of February 2023, a $355 million secured term loan facility with a maturity of February 2024, a $235 million secured term loan facility with a maturity of February 2024 and a $230 million secured term loan facility with a maturity of February 2024. The term loans are payable in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the remaining balance due on the maturity date thereof. In addition, the Company is required, on an annual basis, to make a prepayment in an amount equal to a portion of the Company's excess cash flow, as calculated pursuant to the Amended Credit Facility, which prepayment will be applied first to the term loans until they are paid in full, and then to the revolving loans.\nSubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company can request additional commitments under the revolving line of credit or term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments and/or term loans. The Company can also raise certain additional debt or credit facilities subject to satisfaction of certain covenant levels.\nCertain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Amended Credit Facility and such obligations are secured by (a) substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors and (b) a pledge of 100% of the stock of certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of certain of the Company's direct foreign subsidiaries. The Tranche B-3 Loans are guaranteed by the Company, the U.S. subsidiary guarantors and a cross-guaranty by the borrowers of the Tranche B-3 Loans, and are secured by the collateral securing the revolving loans and the other term loans, in addition to a pledge of the equity interests of Ferro GmbH.\nInterest Rate - Term Loans: The interest rates applicable to the term loans will be, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR rate plus, in both cases, an applicable margin.\n \u00b7 The base rate for term loans will be the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) syndication agent's prime rate, (iii) the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00% or (iv) 0.00%. The applicable margin for base rate loans is 1.25%. \n \u00b7 The LIBOR rate for term loans shall not be less than 0.0% and the applicable margin for LIBOR rate term loans is 2.25%. \n \u00b7 For LIBOR rate term loans, the Company may choose to set the duration on individual borrowings for periods of one, two, three or six months, with the interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate for the corresponding duration. \nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had borrowed $352.3 million under the Tranche B-1 Loans at an interest rate of 5.05%, $233.2 million under the Tranche B-2 Loans at an interest rate of 5.05%, and $228.3 million under the Tranche B-3 Loans at an interest rate of 5.05%. At December 31, 2018, there were no additional borrowings available under the Tranche B-1 Loans, Tranche B-2 Loans and Tranche B-3 Loans. We entered into swap agreements in the second quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, the effective interest rate for the Tranche B-1 Loans, Tranche B-2 Loans, and Tranche B-3 Loans, after adjusting for the interest rate swap, was 5.19%, 3.43%, and 2.48%, respectively.\nInterest Rate - Revolving Credit Line: The interest rates applicable to loans under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will be, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR rate plus, in both cases, an applicable variable margin. The variable margin will be based on the ratio of (a) the Company's total consolidated net debt outstanding (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at such time to (b) the Company's consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) computed for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n \u00b7 The base rate for revolving loans will be the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) syndication agent's prime rate, (iii) the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00% or (iv) 0.00%. The applicable margin for base rate loans will vary between 0.50% to 1.50%. \n \u00b7 The LIBOR rate for revolving loans shall not be less than 0% and the applicable margin for LIBOR rate revolving loans will vary between 1.50% and 2.50%. \n \u00b7 For LIBOR rate revolving loans, the Company may choose to set the duration on individual borrowings for periods of one, two, three or six months, with the interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate for the corresponding duration. \nAt December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. After reductions for outstanding letters of credit secured by these facilities, we had $495.3 million of additional borrowings available under the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2018.\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions, and limitations on certain types of investments. The Amended Credit Facility also contains standard provisions relating to conditions of borrowing and customary events of default, including the non-payment of obligations by the Company and the bankruptcy of the Company.\nSpecific to the 2018 Revolving Facility, the Company is subject to a financial covenant regarding the Company's maximum leverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Amended Credit Facility.\nCredit Facility\nOn February 14, 2017, the Company entered into a credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders to refinance its then outstanding credit facility debt and to provide liquidity for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.\nThe Credit Facility consisted of a $400 million secured revolving line of credit with a term of five years, a $357.5 million secured term loan facility with a term of seven years and a \u20ac250 million secured Euro term loan facility with a term of seven years. The term loans were payable in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the remaining balance due on the maturity date thereof. In addition, the Company was required, on an annual basis, to make a prepayment of term loans until they were fully paid and then to the revolving loans in an amount equal to a portion of the Company's excess cash flow, as calculated pursuant to the Credit Facility.\nSubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company could request additional commitments under the revolving line of credit or term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million, to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments and/or term loans. The Company could also raise certain additional debt or credit facilities subject to satisfaction of certain covenant levels.\nCertain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility and such obligations were secured by (a) substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors and (b) a pledge of 100% of the stock of certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of certain of the Company's direct foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate - Term Loans: The interest rates applicable to the U.S. term loans was, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR rate plus, in both cases, an applicable margin. The interest rates applicable to the Euro term loans was a Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR\u201d) rate plus an applicable margin.\n \u00b7 The base rate for U.S. term loans will be the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) syndication agent's prime rate or (iii) the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for base rate loans is 1.50%. \n \u00b7 The LIBOR rate for U.S. term loans shall not be less than 0.75% and the applicable margin for LIBOR rate U.S. term loans is 2.50%. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n \u00b7 The EURIBOR rate for Euro term loans shall not be less than 0% and the applicable margin for EURIBOR rate loans is 2.75%. \n \u00b7 For LIBOR rate term loans and EURIBOR rate term loans, the Company may choose to set the duration on individual borrowings for periods of one, two, three or six months, with the interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate or EURIBOR rate, as applicable, for the corresponding duration. \nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowed $354.8 million under the secured term loan facility at an interest rate of 4.07% and \u20ac248.1 million (approximately $297.9 million) under the secured Euro term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.75%. At December 31, 2017, there were no additional borrowings available under the term loan facilities. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in the second quarter of 2017. These swaps converted $150 million and \u20ac90 million of our term loans from variable interest rates to fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the effective interest rate for the term loan facilities after adjusting for the interest rate swap was 4.27% for the secured term loan facility and 3.00% for the Euro term loan facility.\nInterest Rate - Revolving Credit Line: The interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit line was, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR rate plus, in both cases, an applicable variable margin. The variable margin was based on the ratio of (a) the Company's total consolidated net debt outstanding at such time to (b) the Company's consolidated EBITDA computed for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended.\n \u00b7 The base rate for revolving loans will be the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) syndication agent's prime rate or (iii) the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for base rate loans will vary between 0.75% and 1.75%. \n \u00b7 The LIBOR rate for revolving loans shall not be less than 0% and the applicable margin for LIBOR rate revolving loans will vary between 1.75% and 2.75%. \n \u00b7 For LIBOR rate revolving loans, the Company may choose to set the duration on individual borrowings for periods of one, two, three or six months, with the interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate for the corresponding duration. \nAt December 31, 2017, there were $78.0 million borrowings under the revolving credit line at an interest rate of 3.63%. After reductions for outstanding letters of credit secured by these facilities, we had $317.3 million of additional borrowings available under the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2017.\nIn conjunction with the refinancing of the Credit Facility, we recorded a charge of $3.2 million in connection with the write-off of unamortized issuance costs, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2014 Credit Facility\nIn 2014, the Company entered into a credit facility that was amended on January 25, 2016, and August 29, 2016, resulting in a $400 million secured revolving line of credit with a term of five years and a $300 million secured term loan facility with a term of seven years from the original issuance date (the 2014 Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders that was replaced on February 14, 2017, by the Credit Facility (as defined above).\nIn conjunction with the refinancing of the 2014 Credit Facility, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million in connection with the write-off of unamortized issuance costs, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nConsignment and Customer Arrangements for Precious Metals. We use precious metals, primarily silver, in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements. The financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. These fees were $2.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of $55.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $37.7 million at December 31, 2017, measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short-term commitments that typically mature within 30 to 90 days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity. On occasion, we have been required to deliver cash collateral. While no deposits were outstanding at December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017, we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment and the amount of collateral-free lines provided by the financial institutions. The amount of cash collateral required is subject to review by the financial institutions and can be changed at any time at their discretion, based in part on their assessment of our creditworthiness.\nInternational Receivable Sales Programs\nWe have several international programs to sell without recourse trade accounts receivable to financial institutions. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. The Company continues to service the receivables sold in exchange for a fee. The program, whose maximum capacity is 100 million Euro, is scheduled to expire in December 2023. At December 31, 2018 the outstanding principal amount of receivables sold under this program was $71.3 million. The carrying amount of deferred purchase price was $23.0 million and is recorded in Other Receivables.\nBank Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled $6.7 million. These agreements primarily relate to Ferro's insurance programs, foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments.\nOther Financing Arrangements\nWe maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for Ferro's short-term liquidity requirements. These facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled $41.4 million at December 31, 2018. We had $30.3 million of additional borrowings available under these lines at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, available lines of credit under the Amended Credit Facility, and cash flows from operating activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $104.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash generated in the U.S. is generally used to pay down amounts outstanding under our 2018 Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. If needed, we could repatriate the majority of cash held by foreign subsidiaries without the need to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes. We do not anticipate a liquidity need requiring such repatriation of these funds to the U.S.\nOur liquidity requirements primarily include debt service, purchase commitments, labor costs, working capital requirements, restructuring expenditures, acquisition costs, capital investments, precious metals cash collateral requirements, and postretirement benefit obligations. We expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs. In 2018, cash flows from operating activities were used to fund our investing activities. Additionally, we used the borrowings available under the Amended Credit Facility to fund acquisitions and for other general business purposes. We had additional borrowing capacity of $525.6 million at December 31, 2018, available under various credit facilities, primarily our revolving credit facility.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including those described in more detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These covenants include customary restrictions, including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions, and limitations on certain types of investments. Specific to the 2018 Revolving Facility, we are subject to a financial covenant regarding the Company's maximum leverage ratio. This covenant under our Amended Credit Facility restricts the amount of our borrowings, reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. This\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfacility is described in more detail in Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d under Item 7 and in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x as our actual ratio was 2.60, providing $116.9 million of EBITDA cushion on the leverage ratio, as defined within the Amended Credit Facility. To the extent that economic conditions in key markets deteriorate or we are unable to meet our business projections and EBITDA falls below approximately $184 million for a rolling four quarters, based on reasonably consistent net debt levels with those as of December 31, 2018, we could become unable to maintain compliance with our leverage ratio covenant. In such case, our lenders could demand immediate payment of outstanding amounts and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nDifficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit, forward contracts, and precious metals program. These counterparties are major, reputable, multinational institutions, all having investment-grade credit ratings. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counterparty default. However, an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nWe assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses, as well as our financial and capital structure, to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives. As part of this process, from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and, where appropriate, pursue the sale of such businesses and assets. We also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position such as the acquisitions we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Generally, we publicly announce material divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into a material definitive agreement or closed on those transactions.\nThe Company's aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_____________________\n (1) Loans Payable includes our loans payable to banks. \n (2) Long-term debt excludes imputed interest and executory costs on capitalized lease obligations and unamortized issuance costs on the term loan facility. \n (3) Interest represents only contractual payments for fixed-rate debt. \n (4) Purchase commitments are noncancelable contractual obligations for raw materials and energy, and exclude capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. \n (5) We have not projected payments past 2019 due to uncertainties in estimating the amount and period of any payments. The amount above relates to our current income tax liability as of December 31, 2018. We have $22.2 million in gross liabilities related to \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n unrecognized tax benefits, including $1.8 million of accrued interest and penalties that are not included in the above table since we cannot reasonably predict the timing of cash settlements with various taxing authorities. \n (6) The funding amounts are based on the minimum contributions required under our various plans and applicable regulations in each respective country. We have not projected contributions past 2020 due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nWhen we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes. We consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: 1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period, we review material sales contracts for proper cut-off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country. For sales of products containing precious metals, we report revenues on a gross basis along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit. We record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions into which we enter.\nRestructuring and Cost Reduction Programs\nIn recent years, we have developed and initiated global cost reduction programs with the objectives of leveraging our global scale, realigning and lowering our cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. Management continues to evaluate our businesses, and therefore, there may be additional provisions for new optimization and cost-savings initiatives, as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded, as payments are made or actions are completed.\nRestructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns. We estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service, contract provisions, local legal requirements, projected final service dates, and salary levels. We also analyze the carrying value of long-lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment. In all likelihood, this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease. While we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely, the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions. Changes in our estimates could increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Other events, such as negotiations with unions and works councils, may also delay the resulting cost savings.\nAccounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nFerro sells its products to customers in diversified industries throughout the world. No customer or related group of customers represents greater than 10% of net sales or accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and require collateral principally for export sales, when industry practices allow and as market conditions dictate, subject to our ability to negotiate secured terms relative to competitive offers. We regularly analyze significant customer accounts and provide for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience, customer payment history, the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, economic conditions, and specific circumstances, as appropriate. Changes in these factors could result in additional allowances. Customer accounts we conclude to be uncollectible or to require excessive collection costs are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, write-offs of uncollectible accounts have been within our expectations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment each year using a measurement date of October 31st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator. We annually, or more frequently as warranted, evaluate the appropriateness of our reporting units utilizing operating segments as the starting point of our analysis. In the event of a change in our reporting units, we would allocate goodwill based on the relative fair value. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting units' fair values, unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate more representative fair values. The income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting units over their useful lives and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting units. We use historical results, trends and our projections of market growth, internal sales efforts and anticipated cost structure assumptions to estimate future cash flows. Using a risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital, we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date. The market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be paid by a market participant in the purchase of similar businesses. If the fair value of any reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value, we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets and liabilities to determine the amount of any impairment.\nThe significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analyses of goodwill at October 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOur estimates of fair value can be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our reporting units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in cost structure could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill. Additionally, an increase in inflation, interest rates or the risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill.\nBased on our 2018 annual impairment test performed as of October 31, 2018, the fair values of the reporting units tested for impairment exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from 21.3% to 206.7% at the 2018 measurement date. The lowest cushion relates to goodwill associated with the Performance Coatings reportable segment, which had a goodwill balance of $44.4 million at December 31, 2018. A future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results are materially less than forecasted results. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and, as a result, not support the carrying values of our reporting units are: new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process, thereby reducing operating margins; new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment or manufacturing processes; and substantial downturns in economic conditions.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nThe Company's long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. We review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances:\n \u00b7 An adverse change in the business climate of a long-lived asset or asset group; \n \u00b7 An adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is used or in its physical condition; \n \u00b7 Current operating losses for a long-lived asset or asset group combined with a history of such losses or projected or forecasted losses that demonstrate that the losses will continue; or \n \u00b7 A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise significantly disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. \nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. In the event of impairment, we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value over fair value. The long-term nature of these assets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of review.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. The final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors, including existing income tax laws and regulations, negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation, and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international income tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset tax liabilities, as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate tax where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist. In evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets, we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, and forecasted income.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more-likely-than-not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and precious metal prices. The accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment. Generally, the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex, and observable market-based inputs are available to measure their fair value. We do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes. The use of financial derivatives is managed under a policy that identifies the conditions necessary to identify the transaction as a financial derivative. Financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We enter into these derivative financial instruments with major, reputable, multinational financial institutions. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counter-party default. We continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective. In the event the hedge becomes ineffective, we discontinue hedge treatment. Except as noted below, we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks.\nOur exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable interest rates. To reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nWe have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to minimize our exposure to floating rate debt agreements denominated in a currency other than functional currency. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense as the interest on the debt is accrued. These swaps are designated as cash flows hedges and we mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income.\nTo help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations against adverse changes in exchange rates, the Company uses non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have executed cross currency interest rate swaps to help protect the value of the Company's net investment in European operations. These swaps are settled in cash, and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense. We mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as cumulative translation adjustments (a component of other comprehensive income).\nWe manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade. Our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of nonfunctional currency cash flows. Our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the Egyptian Pound, the Turkish Lira, the Taiwan Dollar, the Colombian Peso, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee, the Thailand Baht, the Indonesian Rupiah, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Renminbi and the Romanian Leu. We mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions.\nPrecious metals (primarily silver, gold, platinum and palladium) represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronics products. When we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer's request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order, we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content. Our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nWe also purchase portions of our energy requirements, including natural gas and electricity, under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes. Our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts, which are not marked to market.\nTransfer of Financial Assets\nThe Company accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when it has surrendered control over the related assets. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other things, an evaluation of relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe sponsor defined benefit plans in the U.S. and many countries outside the U.S., and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the U.S. The U.S. pension plans and retiree medical plans represent approximately 86% of pension plan assets, 72% of benefit obligations and 56% of net periodic pension expense as of December 31, 2018.\nThe assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs. We meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs.\nWe determine the discount rate for the U.S. pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model. Using the pension plans' projected cash flows, the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield. These portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of AA or better under either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Rating Group, but exclude certain bonds, such as callable bonds, bonds with small amounts outstanding, and bonds with unusually high or low yields. The discount rates for the non-U.S. plans are based on a yield curve method, using AA-rated bonds applicable in their respective capital markets. The duration of each plan's liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration.\nFor the market-related value of plan assets, we use fair value, rather than a calculated value. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years. We calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted-average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans. In determining the expected returns, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return. The Company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions. Our target asset allocation percentages are 35% fixed income, 60% equity, and 5% other investments for U.S. plans and 75% fixed income, 24% equity, and 1% other investments for non-U.S. plans. In 2018, our pension plan assets incurred losses of approximately\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n7% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. In 2017, investment returns on average plan assets were approximately 16% within the U.S. plans and 3% within non-U.S. plans. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company's pension plans.\nAll other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans.\nThe following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans, including a U.S. nonqualified retirement plan, and the retiree medical plan to a 25-basis-point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between 2018 and 2017:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nOur overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans was $19.9 million in 2018 and a credit of $6.4 million in 2017. The change is mainly the result of mark to market actuarial net losses in 2018.\nFor 2019, assuming expected returns on plan assets and no actuarial gains or losses, we expect our overall net periodic benefit expense to be approximately $3.8 million, compared with income of approximately $0.2 million in 2018 on a comparable basis.\nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined utilizing the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age, but also upon assumptions of future usage in production, customer demand and market conditions. Inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods. If actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories, additional write-downs may be required. Slow moving, excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials, and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they are located. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. We expense these recurring costs as they are incurred. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe also accrue for environmental remediation costs and other obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount. We determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions and other circumstances, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies. We adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.\nImpact of Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.",

    "summary": "The passage you've provided appears to be an in-depth financial report detailing Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the year ended on December 31, 2018. It presents a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial performance, including key transactions, financial results, and outlook, as well as a summary of cash flows and critical accounting policies.\n\nKey aspects of the report include:\n\n1. Net Sales and Profits: There was a positive trend with net sales increasing, driven primarily by growth in Performance Coatings, Performance Colors and Glass, and Color Solutions. Net income also showed an increase from the previous year.\n\n2. Expansion Plans: The company outlined plans to expand a production facility in Villagran, Mexico. This expansion is expected to increase revenue and involves the discontinuation of certain production lines in the U.S. and closure of some facilities in Latin America.\n\n3. Transactional Activity: The report provides a list of business acquisitions made during 2017 and 2018. These acquisitions include companies across different regions with various specializations.\n\n4. Outlook: The company's strategy includes organic growth, acquisitions, investments in technology, and optimization initiatives. There is recognition of increased raw materials costs impacting gross margins and acknowledgment of macro-economic uncertainty potentially affecting growth in 2019.\n\n5. Results of Operations: A detailed comparison between the years 2018 and 2017 displays an increase in net income and net sales, while gross profit as a percentage of net sales experienced a decrease.\n\n6. Geographic Revenues: Sales by region are broken down, revealing increases in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Asia Pacific, and the United States, and a slight decrease in Latin America.\n\n7. SG&A Expenses: Selling, General, and Administrative expenses are analyzed, with increases attributed to acquisitions and a decrease in other expenses such as incentive compensation.\n\n8. Restructuring and Impairment Charges: Costs related to restructuring and impairment are examined, showing an overall increase.\n\n9. Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense: Interest expenses increased due to higher average long-term debt balances, while income tax expenses also increased, primarily due to changes in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n10. Liquidity and Capital Resources: The report covers the company's debt, credit facilities, off-balance sheet arrangements, and exposure to various risks.\n\n11. Critical Accounting Policies: Key policies regarding areas like revenue recognition, restructuring, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived asset impairment, income taxes, derivative financial instruments, and pension benefits are discussed.\n\nThe report implies that the company had a strong financial year in 2018 but recognizes potential challenges ahead, including raw material costs, economic uncertainties, and currency volatility. The company's strategy focuses on growth, efficiency improvements, and prudent financial management to navigate these challenges."
