Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBroadcom is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited, or Avago. We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We have four reportable segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial & other, which align with our principal target markets.\nBroadcom Cayman L.P., or the Partnership, is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands in order to effect the business combination between Avago and Broadcom Corporation, or BRCM. Pursuant to the amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement, or the Partnership Agreement, it authorized its common partnership units and restricted exchangeable limited partnership units, or Partnership REUs. The Partnership REUs are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and the Partnership is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Broadcom, its General Partner, has the exclusive right, power and authority to manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs and to make decisions regarding the undertaking and business of the Partnership in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and applicable laws. There is no board of directors of the Partnership.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. We also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc.\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce and market, new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Current uncertainty in global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in the United States and the level of growth in China, still poses significant risks to our business. For example, customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nOn February 1, 2016, or the Acquisition Date, we acquired BRCM for approximately $35.7 billion in ordinary shares, Partnership REUs, and cash, which is discussed in greater detail below under Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d. Since the Acquisition Date, we divested substantially all of the non-core BRCM businesses held-for-sale generating aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million in fiscal year 2016. Non-core BRCM businesses are presented as discontinued operations, and have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn addition to the acquisition of BRCM, highlights during fiscal year 2016 include the following:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016, compared with $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations during fiscal year 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends on its ordinary shares of $716 million, and the Partnership made aggregate distributions of $34 million on its Partnership REUs during fiscal year 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As a result of our acquisition of BRCM, our outstanding debt increased by $11.7 billion, which we have reduced by $2 billion through cash generated from operations and the sale of non-core BRCM businesses noted above since the Acquisition Date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue\nSubstantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products. Our four reportable segments are wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. Applications for our products in these segments include enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments, has varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality, which is discussed in detail below under Seasonality\u201d.\nWe use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. Sales to distributors accounted for 30% and 21% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Historically, a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2016, Foxconn Technology Group companies (including Hon Hai Precision Industries), or together referred to as Foxconn, accounted for 14% of our net revenue, and our top ten direct customers, which also included four distributors, collectively accounted for 50% of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2015, Foxconn accounted for 24% of our net revenue and our top ten direct customers, which also included three distributors, collectively accounted for 58% of our net revenue. We believe our aggregate sales to Apple, Inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with our sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes (which includes Foxconn), accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2016 and more than 20% for fiscal year 2015. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten direct or indirect customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, some of our key customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true in our wireless communications segment as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of, and seasonal variations in, sales of mobile handsets, as well as changes in the overall economic environment.\nIn recent years, approximately 50% of our net revenue has come from sales to distributors, OEMs or contract manufacturers located in China. However, the end-customers for our products, or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China. As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product, or our customers' product incorporating our product, to end-customers located in China.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal cost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, and the cost of assembly and testing of those products. Cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, including share-based compensation, and related occupancy, computer services and equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty and inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, energy costs, other manufacturing expenses and acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs and integration-related costs. Total cost of products sold also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including share-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated\nfacilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including share-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, costs of advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognized intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years. We also recognized goodwill and in-process research and development, which are not amortized, in connection with acquisitions.\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, in-process research and development impairment, fixed asset impairment, facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of the original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt, expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding indebtedness, we incur a loss on the extinguishment of debt.\nOther income, net. Other income, net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities, gains on the sale of cost-method investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items.\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that qualifying income we earn in Singapore is subject to tax holiday or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a corporate headquarters function and specified intellectual property, or IP, activities in Singapore. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2020 and 2025, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have tax holidays on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which are scheduled to expire between 2018 and 2028. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $169 million, $207 million and $99 million, respectively.\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.\nGoing forward, our overall effective tax rate and cash taxes payable will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time and timing of distributions of earnings. In particular, we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside Singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis, potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods. Our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nBroadcom Corporation\nOn February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Broadcom Agreement, by and among Broadcom, Avago, BRCM, the Partnership, and certain other subsidiaries of Broadcom, (i) Broadcom acquired Avago pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement, or the Avago Scheme, in which all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Avago issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Avago Scheme were exchanged on a one-for-one basis, for newly issued ordinary shares of Broadcom, and (ii) thereafter, two subsidiaries of Broadcom merged with and into BRCM with BRCM as the surviving corporation of each such merger, or the Broadcom Merger, in which BRCM shareholders received, in aggregate, approximately $16.8 billion in cash, 112 million of Broadcom ordinary shares and 23 million Partnership REUs in exchange for all shares of BRCM common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Broadcom Merger. In addition, we also paid $137 million in cash for vested BRCM equity awards. Broadcom also assumed unvested restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, originally granted by BRCM and converted them into 6 million Broadcom RSUs. Following the consummation of the Avago Scheme and the Broadcom Merger, or the Broadcom Transaction, each of Avago and BRCM became indirect subsidiaries of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Broadcom Merger was approximately $35.7 billion. We funded the cash portion of the Broadcom Merger with net proceeds from the issuance of $15.6 billion in term loans under a new collateralized credit facility, as amended from time to time, or the 2016 Credit Agreement, that we entered into at the time of closing of the Broadcom Merger, which is discussed in detail in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as cash on hand of the combined companies. The financial results provided in this Form 10-K include the results of operations of BRCM commencing as of the Acquisition Date.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we made several other acquisitions to enhance our competitive position. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired Emulex Corporation, or Emulex, a leader in network connectivity, monitoring and management, for a purchase price of $587 million. In fiscal year 2014, we acquired LSI Corporation, or LSI, a provider of high-performance storage and networking semiconductors used in hard disk drives, solid state drives, communication systems, computer servers, storage systems and personal computers, for a purchase price of $6.5 billion. In fiscal year 2014, we also acquired PLX Technology, Inc., or PLX, a provider of PCI Express, or PCIe, semiconductor and software connectivity solutions, for $308 million.\nThe discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates.\nSee Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPending Acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Brocade Agreement, by and among Broadcom, BRCM, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Brocade, and Bobcat Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BRCM, or Merger Sub. The Brocade Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Brocade with Brocade as the surviving corporation, or the Brocade Merger. As a result of the Brocade Merger, Brocade will become an indirect subsidiary of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, at the effective time of the Brocade Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Brocade common stock held by Brocade stockholders who do not perfect their appraisal rights with respect to the Brocade Merger will be converted into the right to receive $12.75 in cash, without interest. The Brocade Merger is currently valued at $5.5 billion plus $0.4 billion of net debt. We intend to finance the transaction with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe will also assume certain vested (to the extent not in-the-money) and all unvested Brocade stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units held by continuing employees and service providers. All vested in-the-money Brocade stock options, after giving effect to any acceleration, and all other restricted stock units and performance stock units will be cashed out at the effective time of the Brocade Merger.\nBrocade has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement, including, without limitation, covenants not to solicit alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction. Each of Broadcom, BRCM and\nMerger Sub, or collectively, the Broadcom Parties, also has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement.\nConsummation of the Brocade Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including adoption of the Brocade Agreement by Brocade stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the receipt of regulatory clearance under certain other laws and the absence of certain pending governmental litigation with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Brocade Agreement.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, Brocade has agreed to cooperate with us to facilitate the sale, disposition or other transfer of its IP Networking business, including its recently acquired Ruckus Wireless business. The consummation of the Brocade Merger is not conditioned on the divestiture of Brocade's IP Networking business.\nThe Brocade Agreement contains certain termination rights for BRCM and Brocade, and further provides that, upon termination of the Brocade Agreement under certain specified circumstances, Brocade will be obligated to pay us a termination fee of $195 million.\nWe currently expect the Brocade Merger to close in the second half of our fiscal year 2017.\nDivestitures\nSale of BRCM Businesses\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we completed the sales of certain non-core BRCM businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $36 million.\nSale of LSI Businesses\nOn September 2, 2014, we sold the LSI Flash business and related assets to Seagate Technology LLC for $450 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $18 million.\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold the LSI Axxia networking business and related assets to Intel Corporation for $650 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory valuation, income taxes, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation and employee bonus programs.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.\nBusiness combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical\nestimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nValuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets including purchased in-process research and development, assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long-lived asset relates to, consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nInventory valuation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.\nIncome taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. If we determine, in the future, that a valuation allowance is required, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine, in the future, a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in Singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist.\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs over the employees' average expected future service to us, based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of GAAP. One critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs. Other important assumptions include the expected long-term return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates - October 30, 2016 and November 1, 2015, for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans, in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. For fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high- quality corporate bond yields, depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense.\nWe base our salary increase assumptions on historical experience and future expectations. In developing the expected rate of return, we consider long-term compound annualized returns based on historical market data, historical and expected returns on the various categories of plan assets, and the target investment portfolio allocation among debt, equity securities and other investments.\nActuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment. Material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is the key assumption in calculating U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated $43 million impact on the benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2017.\nShare-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense consists of expense for share options and restricted share units, or RSUs, granted to employees and non-employees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with Broadcom employee share purchase plan. We recognize compensation expense for share options based on the estimated grant-date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we granted share price performance options, which are accounted for as market-based share options. In fiscal year 2015, we began granting share price performance RSUs instead, which are accounted for as market-based RSUs. The fair value of these market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our time-based option awards.\nEmployee Bonus Programs. Our employee bonus programs, which are overseen by our Compensation Committee or our Board, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall\ncorporate annual targets and functional performance metrics. In the first fiscal quarter of the year, if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a variable, proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100% achievement of the targets and metrics. The bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100% and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved. In subsequent quarters, we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics. The actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year, which is subject to approval by our Compensation Committee, may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters, which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSee Note 2.

of the Broadcom Merger on the Acquisition Date. As a result of the Broadcom Merger, our wired infrastructure segment now constitutes our largest segment.\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the contributions since the Acquisition Date from acquired BRCM products included in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to revenue contributions of approximately $1.8 billion from sales of acquired BRCM wireless connectivity and\nrelated products since the Acquisition Date, partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately $525 million in sales of our radio frequency, or RF, components due to reduced demand from a key North American smartphone customer. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to the additional revenue resulting from a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment remained essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2015. Our net revenue in fiscal year 2016 also included $450 million from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP, compared to $313 million in fiscal year 2015, which primarily benefited our wired infrastructure and industrial & other segments.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $5.9 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions to our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments from the BRCM businesses acquired in February 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 45% and 52% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 7% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was largely due to $1.2 billion of costs resulting from the step-up of inventory to fair value and the increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Broadcom Merger.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $1.6 billion, or 155% in fiscal year 2016. Research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 20% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 15% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in research and development expense dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in research and development expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $320 million, or 66% in fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 6% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 7% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the acquired BRCM businesses and the acquisition-related costs. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the realization of synergies resulting from the integration of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in selling, general and administrative expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $2.6 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $733 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the Broadcom Merger.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges, recognized primarily in operating expenses, were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $144 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was due primarily to the Broadcom Merger, including impairment charges of $417 million for termination of in-process research and development projects and $173 million for property, plant and equipment. Restructuring charges were due primarily to employee termination costs of approximately $418 million, and lease termination and other exit costs of $29 million, primarily resulting from the BRCM acquisition. We expect to incur approximately additional $50 million of restructuring charges in future periods as a result of the Broadcom Merger. We may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of any future acquisitions, particularly our pending acquisition of Brocade.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: Table 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wired infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial & other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to contributions from the acquired BRCM wired products. Operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to contributions from the BRCM wireless connectivity products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our RF components from a key North American smartphone customer. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was flat.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 368% in fiscal year 2016, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increases in charges related to the step-up of inventory to fair value, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, and costs incurred in connection with the Broadcom Merger. Additionally, share-based compensation increased due to RSUs assumed in, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $585 million for fiscal year 2016 and $191 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to interest on higher outstanding debt balances and expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees, in each case associated with the term loan indebtedness we incurred to finance the Broadcom Merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During fiscal year 2016, in connection with the closing of the Broadcom Merger, we repaid in full our term loan borrowings under a collateralized credit agreement with lenders named therein entered into in fiscal year 2014, or the 2014 Credit Agreement. We subsequently repaid our \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan (defined below) partially funded by the sale of certain acquired BRCM assets that were held for sale. We also repaid our $500 million Term B-2 Loan (defined below), partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan (defined below) borrowings. These payments and the August 2016 Amendments (defined below) resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $123 million for fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we made a $593 million principal prepayment on term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and settled the 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, or the Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million for fiscal year 2015.\nIn connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, three Broadcom subsidiaries entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement, which originally provided for a Term A loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.4 billion, or the Term A Loan, a Term B-1 dollar loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $9.8 billion, or the Term B-1 Loan, a Term B-1 euro loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of \u20ac900 million, equivalent to $978 million as of February 1, 2016, or the Term B-1 Euro Loan, a Term B-2 loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million, or the Term B-2 Loan, and together with the Term A Loan, Term B-1 Loan, and Term B-1 Euro Loan, referred to as the 2016 Term Loans. The 2016 Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility, or the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, that permits us to borrow from time to time in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million for working capital and other corporate purposes, including swingline loans of up to $150 million in the aggregate and for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $100 million in the aggregate, which, in the case of swingline loans and letters of credit, reduce the available borrowing capacity under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar for dollar basis.\nProvision for income taxes. For fiscal year 2016, we had a provision for income taxes of $642 million compared to $76 million for fiscal year 2015. The income tax provision for the fiscal year 2016 is primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings, partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we determined that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated and current foreign earnings in our operations outside of Singapore. As a result, we made a provision for taxes on $1.9 billion of our undistributed earnings as of November 1, 2015, including projected withholding taxes that would become payable upon the distribution of those earnings, and recognized $93 million of expense in fiscal year 2016 related to the undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.\nAt the time we completed the Broadcom Merger, in connection with the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, we established a deferred tax liability that is associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of BRCM's IP, which was completed in November 2016. This tax liability will become payable as earnings resulting from this integration of IP are distributed over time.\nAs a result of these events, the amount of our income taxes payable could increase materially and consume an increasing amount of our cash. In addition, our provision for income taxes in future periods is likely to change as a result of the impact of internal restructuring and reorganization, in particular as a result of the Broadcom Merger, which would also affect our overall effective tax rate.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:

<td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased 28% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved revenue contributions from our application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and from the inclusion of a full year of contributions from LSI products in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased 50% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a substantial increase in our RF product content in smartphones and an increase in unit sales of smartphones containing our products. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased 151% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. This segment was acquired in the LSI acquisition and fiscal year 2015 results reflect a full year of operating results compared to a partial year of operating results in fiscal year 2014. The results for fiscal year 2015 also reflect contributions from Emulex following its acquisition and an improvement in the business due to market share gains as well as growth in end market demand. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment increased 12% in fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to an increase in IP licensing revenue. Net revenue for fiscal year 2015 included $313 million of revenue from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP compared to $160 million for fiscal year 2014.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2014, an increase of $1.7 billion. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 52% for fiscal year 2015, compared to 44% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in gross margin, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to gross margin contributions from our enterprise storage segment, which we acquired in the LSI acquisition, an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products, and a decrease in charges associated with the inventory step-up to fair value related to acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $354 million or 51% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense remained relatively flat at 15% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 16% for fiscal year 2014. The majority of the increase in dollars was related primarily to the impact of LSI and PLX for the full fiscal year, the impact of Emulex for the second half of fiscal year 2015, and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $79 million or 19% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 7% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 10% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense, in dollars, was primarily due to the impact of the LSI acquisition for the full fiscal year and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2015, as revenue growth outpaced the increase in selling, general and administrative expense.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization expense of intangible assets was $733 million and $446 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, an increase of $287 million. The increase in amortization expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization for intangible assets obtained in the LSI and PLX acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nWe incurred total restructuring and asset impairment charges of $144 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $162 million for fiscal year 2014. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year 2015 were primarily due to employee termination costs related to the Emulex and LSI acquisitions. The restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 were due primarily to employee termination costs related to the LSI acquisition.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we realigned certain product groups within our wired infrastructure segment and agreed to sell certain fiber optics subsystems assets to a third party. As a result, we recognized a $61 million loss to write these assets down to fair value less costs to sell.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wired infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial & other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment was 32% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 67% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to gross margin improvement and higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our wireless communications segment was 47% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 83%, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue and improvement in product mix. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment was 39% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 193% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was 49% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 26% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher IP licensing revenue.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 16% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increases in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets incurred in connection with our acquisitions of LSI, PLX and Emulex. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $191 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $110 million for fiscal year 2014. This $81 million increase in interest expense was due to the full year interest on our outstanding 2014 Term Loans, along with the amortization of related debt issuance costs that were being charged to interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective borrowing terms.\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $76 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $33 million for fiscal year 2014. The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2015 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in profit before tax.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment. This segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly in the wireless communications and enterprise storage segments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2016 consisted of: (1) $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations, (3) our outstanding revolving credit facility of up to $500 million aggregate\nprincipal amount, or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which is committed until February 1, 2021, and substantially all of which was available to be drawn as of October 30, 2016, and (4) our ability to increase the aggregate term loans and revolving credit commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement, referred to as the accordion feature, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2016 Credit Agreement and the availability of commitments. The 2016 Credit Agreement was entered in connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, and replaced our 2014 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement is discussed in more detail under in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, including the Brocade Merger, (v) interim cash dividend payments by Broadcom (if and when declared by the Board), (vi) cash distributions by the Partnership (if and when declared by the Partnership's general partner), (vii) payment of income taxes, including taxes paid as a result of the intercompany transfer of IP acquired in the Broadcom Merger, and (viii) funding employee benefit plan obligations. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be higher than fiscal year 2016, due primarily to expenditures for construction at our Irvine and San Jose campuses, continued expenditures for capacity expansion in our Fort Collins internal fabrication facility, spending on equipment to support various research and development projects and purchases of test manufacturing equipment.\nOur debt and liquidity needs will also increase as a result of the closing of the Brocade Merger. We intend to finance the estimated $5.5 billion of cash consideration with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations, combined with current borrowing availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the accordion feature in our 2016 Credit Agreement, as well as committed debt funding related to the pending Brocade Merger, provide sufficient liquidity, after giving effect to the pending Brocade Merger, to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations, for at least the next 12 months.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement, or otherwise, to fund the transaction. We could also reduce certain expenditures such as payment of our cash dividend. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances we may also seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur, including under the 2016 Term Loans and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\nWe may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities, or otherwise increase our outstanding indebtedness, for reasons other than those specified above.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares for $12 million. We did not repurchase any shares in fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\nShare repurchases under our share repurchase programs were made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as we deemed appropriate.\nSummary and Highlights\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016 from $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015. The increase was largely due to $3.4 billion in net cash provided by operating activities, $19.5 billion of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans, $898 million of aggregate proceeds received from the sales of businesses and $295 million from the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercises of share options and purchase rights under Broadcom's employee share purchase plan, partially offset by $10 billion in cash paid in the Broadcom Merger, the repayment of $9.8 billion, in aggregate principal amount, of our term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and a portion of the 2016 Term Loans, the repayment of $1.5 billion of debt assumed in the Broadcom Merger, $750 million in dividend payments by Broadcom and cash distributions by the Partnership (discussed in more detail below), $723 million in capital expenditures, and $123 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Term Loans.\nDividends/Distributions\nBroadcom paid aggregate cash dividends of $1.94 and $1.55 per ordinary share, or $716 million and $408 million, during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Partnership paid aggregate cash distributions of $594 million to Broadcom, as General Partner, and cash distributions of $1.50 per Partnership REU, or $34 million, to its limited partners during fiscal year 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: Table 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities represents net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to the adjustments to net loss for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of a net loss during fiscal 2016. The adjustments to net loss for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges and deferred taxes. Changes in assets and liabilities as of October 30, 2016 compared to November 1, 2015 are primarily due to the Broadcom Merger.\nThe $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to the increase in net income and the adjustments to net income for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax from share-based compensation.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures. The change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily relates to $10 billion paid for the Broadcom Merger, a $130 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and a $44 million increase in purchases of investments, partially offset by a $248 million increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses and a $104 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments.\nThe change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to $6.0 billion paid in aggregate for the LSI and PLX acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 and a $200 million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by $394 million paid primarily for the Emulex acquisition in fiscal year 2015 and a $184 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2015, primarily in connection with the expansion of our internal manufacturing facilities in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nFinancing Activities\nBroadcom\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, offset by the repayment of term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt, dividend payments by Broadcom, cash distributions by the Partnership and payments of debt issuance costs. The change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and a $54 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repayment of 2014 Term Loans, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt and a $342 million increase in dividend payments.\nThe change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to the proceeds of $4.6 billion from term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and $1 billion from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in fiscal year 2014, an increase in fiscal year 2015 for debt repayments of $1.8 billion and a $124 million increase in dividend payments, partially offset by a $117 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of our ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans and an $86 million increase in excess tax benefit.\nThe Partnership\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities for the Partnership are materially the same as those discussed for Broadcom above. The differences are due to capital transactions with the General Partner, which are a result of the capital contributions from Broadcom to the Partnership.\nIndebtedness\nSee Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n2016 Credit Agreement\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we made principal prepayments totaling $610 million on the Term B-1 Loan and fully repaid the \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan and the $500 million Term B-2 Loan. The paydown of the Term B-2 Loan was partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan borrowings. As a result, during fiscal year 2016, we wrote-off $40 million of debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn August 2016, we amended the 2016 Credit Agreement and refinanced all of the outstanding Term B-1 Loans into the Term B-3 Loans and increased the amount of outstanding Term A Loans, or the August 2016 Amendments. The August 2016 Amendments reduced the applicable margins on the outstanding balance under the Term B-3 Loans and increased our operating flexibility, including the automatic release of all collateral securing the 2016 Term Loans upon the repayment of all outstanding Term B-3 Loans and our achievement of the specified investment grade ratings. As a result of the August 2016 Amendments, we wrote-off $49 million of our previously deferred debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThe 2016 Term Loans bear interest at floating rates which were 2.28% for the Term A Loans and 3.53% for the Term B-3 Loans as of October 30, 2016.\nAs of October 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loans, net of the unaccreted discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, was $13.5 billion. As of October 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility or material outstanding letters of credit.\nWe were in compliance with all of the covenants described in the 2016 Credit Agreement as of October 30, 2016. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the aggregate 2016 Term Loans and/or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of October 30, 2016 (in millions):\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt principal, interest and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plan contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Principal, Interest and Fees. Represents principal, interest and commitment fees payable on borrowings and credit facilities under the 2016 Credit Agreement and outstanding senior unsecured notes that we assumed as a result of the Broadcom Merger.\nPurchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new\ncampuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and, therefore, cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above.\nOther Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. Represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.\nPension Plan Contribution. Represents our planned minimum contributions to our pension plans. Although additional future contributions will be required, the amount and timing of these contributions will be affected by actuarial assumptions, the actual rate of returns on plan assets, the level of market interest rates, legislative changes and the amount of voluntary contributions to the plans. The amount shown in the table represents our planned contributions to our pension plans within a year. Because any contributions for fiscal year 2018 and later will depend on the value of the plan assets in the future and thus are uncertain, we have not included any amounts for fiscal year 2018 and beyond in the above table.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2016, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $893 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2016 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at October 30, 2016 as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\nIndemnifications\nSee Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBroadcom is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited, or Avago. We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We have four reportable segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial & other, which align with our principal target markets.\nBroadcom Cayman L.P., or the Partnership, is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands in order to effect the business combination between Avago and Broadcom Corporation, or BRCM. Pursuant to the amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement, or the Partnership Agreement, it authorized its common partnership units and restricted exchangeable limited partnership units, or Partnership REUs. The Partnership REUs are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and the Partnership is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Broadcom, its General Partner, has the exclusive right, power and authority to manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs and to make decisions regarding the undertaking and business of the Partnership in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and applicable laws. There is no board of directors of the Partnership.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. We also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc.\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:\n \u2022 general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets; \n \u2022 our ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce and market, new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner; \n \u2022 the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders; \n \u2022 the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; and \n \u2022 the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products.  Current uncertainty in global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in the United States and the level of growth in China, still poses significant risks to our business. For example, customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nOn February 1, 2016, or the Acquisition Date, we acquired BRCM for approximately $35.7 billion in ordinary shares, Partnership REUs, and cash, which is discussed in greater detail below under Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d. Since the Acquisition Date, we divested substantially all of the non-core BRCM businesses held-for-sale generating aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million in fiscal year 2016. Non-core BRCM businesses are presented as discontinued operations, and have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn addition to the acquisition of BRCM, highlights during fiscal year 2016 include the following:\n \u2022 Our cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016, compared with $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations during fiscal year 2016. \n \u2022 Broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends on its ordinary shares of $716 million, and the Partnership made aggregate distributions of $34 million on its Partnership REUs during fiscal year 2016. \n \u2022 As a result of our acquisition of BRCM, our outstanding debt increased by $11.7 billion, which we have reduced by $2 billion through cash generated from operations and the sale of non-core BRCM businesses noted above since the Acquisition Date. \nNet Revenue\nSubstantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products. Our four reportable segments are wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. Applications for our products in these segments include enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments, has varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality, which is discussed in detail below under Seasonality\u201d.\nWe use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. Sales to distributors accounted for 30% and 21% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Historically, a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2016, Foxconn Technology Group companies (including Hon Hai Precision Industries), or together referred to as Foxconn, accounted for 14% of our net revenue, and our top ten direct customers, which also included four distributors, collectively accounted for 50% of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2015, Foxconn accounted for 24% of our net revenue and our top ten direct customers, which also included three distributors, collectively accounted for 58% of our net revenue. We believe our aggregate sales to Apple, Inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with our sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes (which includes Foxconn), accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2016 and more than 20% for fiscal year 2015. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten direct or indirect customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, some of our key customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true in our wireless communications segment as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of, and seasonal variations in, sales of mobile handsets, as well as changes in the overall economic environment.\nIn recent years, approximately 50% of our net revenue has come from sales to distributors, OEMs or contract manufacturers located in China. However, the end-customers for our products, or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China. As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product, or our customers' product incorporating our product, to end-customers located in China.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal cost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, and the cost of assembly and testing of those products. Cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, including share-based compensation, and related occupancy, computer services and equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty and inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, energy costs, other manufacturing expenses and acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs and integration-related costs. Total cost of products sold also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including share-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated\nfacilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including share-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, costs of advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognized intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years. We also recognized goodwill and in-process research and development, which are not amortized, in connection with acquisitions.\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, in-process research and development impairment, fixed asset impairment, facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of the original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt, expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding indebtedness, we incur a loss on the extinguishment of debt.\nOther income, net. Other income, net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities, gains on the sale of cost-method investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items.\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that qualifying income we earn in Singapore is subject to tax holiday or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a corporate headquarters function and specified intellectual property, or IP, activities in Singapore. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2020 and 2025, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have tax holidays on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which are scheduled to expire between 2018 and 2028. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $169 million, $207 million and $99 million, respectively.\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.\nGoing forward, our overall effective tax rate and cash taxes payable will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time and timing of distributions of earnings. In particular, we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside Singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis, potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods. Our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nBroadcom Corporation\nOn February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Broadcom Agreement, by and among Broadcom, Avago, BRCM, the Partnership, and certain other subsidiaries of Broadcom, (i) Broadcom acquired Avago pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement, or the Avago Scheme, in which all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Avago issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Avago Scheme were exchanged on a one-for-one basis, for newly issued ordinary shares of Broadcom, and (ii) thereafter, two subsidiaries of Broadcom merged with and into BRCM with BRCM as the surviving corporation of each such merger, or the Broadcom Merger, in which BRCM shareholders received, in aggregate, approximately $16.8 billion in cash, 112 million of Broadcom ordinary shares and 23 million Partnership REUs in exchange for all shares of BRCM common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Broadcom Merger. In addition, we also paid $137 million in cash for vested BRCM equity awards. Broadcom also assumed unvested restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, originally granted by BRCM and converted them into 6 million Broadcom RSUs. Following the consummation of the Avago Scheme and the Broadcom Merger, or the Broadcom Transaction, each of Avago and BRCM became indirect subsidiaries of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Broadcom Merger was approximately $35.7 billion. We funded the cash portion of the Broadcom Merger with net proceeds from the issuance of $15.6 billion in term loans under a new collateralized credit facility, as amended from time to time, or the 2016 Credit Agreement, that we entered into at the time of closing of the Broadcom Merger, which is discussed in detail in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as cash on hand of the combined companies. The financial results provided in this Form 10-K include the results of operations of BRCM commencing as of the Acquisition Date.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we made several other acquisitions to enhance our competitive position. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired Emulex Corporation, or Emulex, a leader in network connectivity, monitoring and management, for a purchase price of $587 million. In fiscal year 2014, we acquired LSI Corporation, or LSI, a provider of high-performance storage and networking semiconductors used in hard disk drives, solid state drives, communication systems, computer servers, storage systems and personal computers, for a purchase price of $6.5 billion. In fiscal year 2014, we also acquired PLX Technology, Inc., or PLX, a provider of PCI Express, or PCIe, semiconductor and software connectivity solutions, for $308 million.\nThe discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates.\nSee Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPending Acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Brocade Agreement, by and among Broadcom, BRCM, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Brocade, and Bobcat Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BRCM, or Merger Sub. The Brocade Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Brocade with Brocade as the surviving corporation, or the Brocade Merger. As a result of the Brocade Merger, Brocade will become an indirect subsidiary of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, at the effective time of the Brocade Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Brocade common stock held by Brocade stockholders who do not perfect their appraisal rights with respect to the Brocade Merger will be converted into the right to receive $12.75 in cash, without interest. The Brocade Merger is currently valued at $5.5 billion plus $0.4 billion of net debt. We intend to finance the transaction with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe will also assume certain vested (to the extent not in-the-money) and all unvested Brocade stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units held by continuing employees and service providers. All vested in-the-money Brocade stock options, after giving effect to any acceleration, and all other restricted stock units and performance stock units will be cashed out at the effective time of the Brocade Merger.\nBrocade has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement, including, without limitation, covenants not to solicit alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction. Each of Broadcom, BRCM and\nMerger Sub, or collectively, the Broadcom Parties, also has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement.\nConsummation of the Brocade Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including adoption of the Brocade Agreement by Brocade stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the receipt of regulatory clearance under certain other laws and the absence of certain pending governmental litigation with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Brocade Agreement.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, Brocade has agreed to cooperate with us to facilitate the sale, disposition or other transfer of its IP Networking business, including its recently acquired Ruckus Wireless business. The consummation of the Brocade Merger is not conditioned on the divestiture of Brocade's IP Networking business.\nThe Brocade Agreement contains certain termination rights for BRCM and Brocade, and further provides that, upon termination of the Brocade Agreement under certain specified circumstances, Brocade will be obligated to pay us a termination fee of $195 million.\nWe currently expect the Brocade Merger to close in the second half of our fiscal year 2017.\nDivestitures\nSale of BRCM Businesses\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we completed the sales of certain non-core BRCM businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $36 million.\nSale of LSI Businesses\nOn September 2, 2014, we sold the LSI Flash business and related assets to Seagate Technology LLC for $450 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $18 million.\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold the LSI Axxia networking business and related assets to Intel Corporation for $650 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory valuation, income taxes, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation and employee bonus programs.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.\nBusiness combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical\nestimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nValuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets including purchased in-process research and development, assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long-lived asset relates to, consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nInventory valuation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.\nIncome taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. If we determine, in the future, that a valuation allowance is required, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine, in the future, a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in Singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist.\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs over the employees' average expected future service to us, based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of GAAP. One critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs. Other important assumptions include the expected long-term return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates - October 30, 2016 and November 1, 2015, for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans, in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. For fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high- quality corporate bond yields, depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense.\nWe base our salary increase assumptions on historical experience and future expectations. In developing the expected rate of return, we consider long-term compound annualized returns based on historical market data, historical and expected returns on the various categories of plan assets, and the target investment portfolio allocation among debt, equity securities and other investments.\nActuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment. Material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is the key assumption in calculating U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated $43 million impact on the benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2017.\nShare-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense consists of expense for share options and restricted share units, or RSUs, granted to employees and non-employees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with Broadcom employee share purchase plan. We recognize compensation expense for share options based on the estimated grant-date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we granted share price performance options, which are accounted for as market-based share options. In fiscal year 2015, we began granting share price performance RSUs instead, which are accounted for as market-based RSUs. The fair value of these market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our time-based option awards.\nEmployee Bonus Programs. Our employee bonus programs, which are overseen by our Compensation Committee or our Board, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall\ncorporate annual targets and functional performance metrics. In the first fiscal quarter of the year, if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a variable, proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100% achievement of the targets and metrics. The bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100% and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved. In subsequent quarters, we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics. The actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year, which is subject to approval by our Compensation Committee, may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters, which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSee Note 2.

of the Broadcom Merger on the Acquisition Date. As a result of the Broadcom Merger, our wired infrastructure segment now constitutes our largest segment.\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the contributions since the Acquisition Date from acquired BRCM products included in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to revenue contributions of approximately $1.8 billion from sales of acquired BRCM wireless connectivity and\nrelated products since the Acquisition Date, partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately $525 million in sales of our radio frequency, or RF, components due to reduced demand from a key North American smartphone customer. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to the additional revenue resulting from a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment remained essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2015. Our net revenue in fiscal year 2016 also included $450 million from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP, compared to $313 million in fiscal year 2015, which primarily benefited our wired infrastructure and industrial & other segments.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $5.9 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions to our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments from the BRCM businesses acquired in February 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 45% and 52% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 7% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was largely due to $1.2 billion of costs resulting from the step-up of inventory to fair value and the increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Broadcom Merger.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $1.6 billion, or 155% in fiscal year 2016. Research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 20% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 15% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in research and development expense dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in research and development expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $320 million, or 66% in fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 6% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 7% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the acquired BRCM businesses and the acquisition-related costs. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the realization of synergies resulting from the integration of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in selling, general and administrative expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $2.6 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $733 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the Broadcom Merger.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges, recognized primarily in operating expenses, were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $144 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was due primarily to the Broadcom Merger, including impairment charges of $417 million for termination of in-process research and development projects and $173 million for property, plant and equipment. Restructuring charges were due primarily to employee termination costs of approximately $418 million, and lease termination and other exit costs of $29 million, primarily resulting from the BRCM acquisition. We expect to incur approximately additional $50 million of restructuring charges in future periods as a result of the Broadcom Merger. We may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of any future acquisitions, particularly our pending acquisition of Brocade.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: Table 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wired infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial & other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to contributions from the acquired BRCM wired products. Operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to contributions from the BRCM wireless connectivity products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our RF components from a key North American smartphone customer. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was flat.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 368% in fiscal year 2016, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increases in charges related to the step-up of inventory to fair value, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, and costs incurred in connection with the Broadcom Merger. Additionally, share-based compensation increased due to RSUs assumed in, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $585 million for fiscal year 2016 and $191 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to interest on higher outstanding debt balances and expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees, in each case associated with the term loan indebtedness we incurred to finance the Broadcom Merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During fiscal year 2016, in connection with the closing of the Broadcom Merger, we repaid in full our term loan borrowings under a collateralized credit agreement with lenders named therein entered into in fiscal year 2014, or the 2014 Credit Agreement. We subsequently repaid our \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan (defined below) partially funded by the sale of certain acquired BRCM assets that were held for sale. We also repaid our $500 million Term B-2 Loan (defined below), partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan (defined below) borrowings. These payments and the August 2016 Amendments (defined below) resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $123 million for fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we made a $593 million principal prepayment on term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and settled the 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, or the Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million for fiscal year 2015.\nIn connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, three Broadcom subsidiaries entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement, which originally provided for a Term A loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.4 billion, or the Term A Loan, a Term B-1 dollar loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $9.8 billion, or the Term B-1 Loan, a Term B-1 euro loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of \u20ac900 million, equivalent to $978 million as of February 1, 2016, or the Term B-1 Euro Loan, a Term B-2 loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million, or the Term B-2 Loan, and together with the Term A Loan, Term B-1 Loan, and Term B-1 Euro Loan, referred to as the 2016 Term Loans. The 2016 Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility, or the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, that permits us to borrow from time to time in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million for working capital and other corporate purposes, including swingline loans of up to $150 million in the aggregate and for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $100 million in the aggregate, which, in the case of swingline loans and letters of credit, reduce the available borrowing capacity under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar for dollar basis.\nProvision for income taxes. For fiscal year 2016, we had a provision for income taxes of $642 million compared to $76 million for fiscal year 2015. The income tax provision for the fiscal year 2016 is primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings, partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we determined that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated and current foreign earnings in our operations outside of Singapore. As a result, we made a provision for taxes on $1.9 billion of our undistributed earnings as of November 1, 2015, including projected withholding taxes that would become payable upon the distribution of those earnings, and recognized $93 million of expense in fiscal year 2016 related to the undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.\nAt the time we completed the Broadcom Merger, in connection with the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, we established a deferred tax liability that is associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of BRCM's IP, which was completed in November 2016. This tax liability will become payable as earnings resulting from this integration of IP are distributed over time.\nAs a result of these events, the amount of our income taxes payable could increase materially and consume an increasing amount of our cash. In addition, our provision for income taxes in future periods is likely to change as a result of the impact of internal restructuring and reorganization, in particular as a result of the Broadcom Merger, which would also affect our overall effective tax rate.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:

<td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased 28% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved revenue contributions from our application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and from the inclusion of a full year of contributions from LSI products in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased 50% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a substantial increase in our RF product content in smartphones and an increase in unit sales of smartphones containing our products. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased 151% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. This segment was acquired in the LSI acquisition and fiscal year 2015 results reflect a full year of operating results compared to a partial year of operating results in fiscal year 2014. The results for fiscal year 2015 also reflect contributions from Emulex following its acquisition and an improvement in the business due to market share gains as well as growth in end market demand. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment increased 12% in fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to an increase in IP licensing revenue. Net revenue for fiscal year 2015 included $313 million of revenue from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP compared to $160 million for fiscal year 2014.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2014, an increase of $1.7 billion. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 52% for fiscal year 2015, compared to 44% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in gross margin, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to gross margin contributions from our enterprise storage segment, which we acquired in the LSI acquisition, an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products, and a decrease in charges associated with the inventory step-up to fair value related to acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $354 million or 51% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense remained relatively flat at 15% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 16% for fiscal year 2014. The majority of the increase in dollars was related primarily to the impact of LSI and PLX for the full fiscal year, the impact of Emulex for the second half of fiscal year 2015, and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $79 million or 19% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 7% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 10% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense, in dollars, was primarily due to the impact of the LSI acquisition for the full fiscal year and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2015, as revenue growth outpaced the increase in selling, general and administrative expense.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization expense of intangible assets was $733 million and $446 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, an increase of $287 million. The increase in amortization expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization for intangible assets obtained in the LSI and PLX acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nWe incurred total restructuring and asset impairment charges of $144 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $162 million for fiscal year 2014. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year 2015 were primarily due to employee termination costs related to the Emulex and LSI acquisitions. The restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 were due primarily to employee termination costs related to the LSI acquisition.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we realigned certain product groups within our wired infrastructure segment and agreed to sell certain fiber optics subsystems assets to a third party. As a result, we recognized a $61 million loss to write these assets down to fair value less costs to sell.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except for percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wired infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise storage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial & other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment was 32% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 67% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to gross margin improvement and higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our wireless communications segment was 47% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 83%, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue and improvement in product mix. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment was 39% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 193% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was 49% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 26% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher IP licensing revenue.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 16% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increases in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets incurred in connection with our acquisitions of LSI, PLX and Emulex. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $191 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $110 million for fiscal year 2014. This $81 million increase in interest expense was due to the full year interest on our outstanding 2014 Term Loans, along with the amortization of related debt issuance costs that were being charged to interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective borrowing terms.\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $76 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $33 million for fiscal year 2014. The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2015 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in profit before tax.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment. This segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly in the wireless communications and enterprise storage segments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2016 consisted of: (1) $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations, (3) our outstanding revolving credit facility of up to $500 million aggregate\nprincipal amount, or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which is committed until February 1, 2021, and substantially all of which was available to be drawn as of October 30, 2016, and (4) our ability to increase the aggregate term loans and revolving credit commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement, referred to as the accordion feature, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2016 Credit Agreement and the availability of commitments. The 2016 Credit Agreement was entered in connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, and replaced our 2014 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement is discussed in more detail under in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, including the Brocade Merger, (v) interim cash dividend payments by Broadcom (if and when declared by the Board), (vi) cash distributions by the Partnership (if and when declared by the Partnership's general partner), (vii) payment of income taxes, including taxes paid as a result of the intercompany transfer of IP acquired in the Broadcom Merger, and (viii) funding employee benefit plan obligations. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be higher than fiscal year 2016, due primarily to expenditures for construction at our Irvine and San Jose campuses, continued expenditures for capacity expansion in our Fort Collins internal fabrication facility, spending on equipment to support various research and development projects and purchases of test manufacturing equipment.\nOur debt and liquidity needs will also increase as a result of the closing of the Brocade Merger. We intend to finance the estimated $5.5 billion of cash consideration with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations, combined with current borrowing availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the accordion feature in our 2016 Credit Agreement, as well as committed debt funding related to the pending Brocade Merger, provide sufficient liquidity, after giving effect to the pending Brocade Merger, to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations, for at least the next 12 months.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement, or otherwise, to fund the transaction. We could also reduce certain expenditures such as payment of our cash dividend. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances we may also seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur, including under the 2016 Term Loans and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\nWe may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities, or otherwise increase our outstanding indebtedness, for reasons other than those specified above.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares for $12 million. We did not repurchase any shares in fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\nShare repurchases under our share repurchase programs were made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as we deemed appropriate.\nSummary and Highlights\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016 from $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015. The increase was largely due to $3.4 billion in net cash provided by operating activities, $19.5 billion of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans, $898 million of aggregate proceeds received from the sales of businesses and $295 million from the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercises of share options and purchase rights under Broadcom's employee share purchase plan, partially offset by $10 billion in cash paid in the Broadcom Merger, the repayment of $9.8 billion, in aggregate principal amount, of our term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and a portion of the 2016 Term Loans, the repayment of $1.5 billion of debt assumed in the Broadcom Merger, $750 million in dividend payments by Broadcom and cash distributions by the Partnership (discussed in more detail below), $723 million in capital expenditures, and $123 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Term Loans.\nDividends/Distributions\nBroadcom paid aggregate cash dividends of $1.94 and $1.55 per ordinary share, or $716 million and $408 million, during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Partnership paid aggregate cash distributions of $594 million to Broadcom, as General Partner, and cash distributions of $1.50 per Partnership REU, or $34 million, to its limited partners during fiscal year 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: Table 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities represents net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to the adjustments to net loss for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of a net loss during fiscal 2016. The adjustments to net loss for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges and deferred taxes. Changes in assets and liabilities as of October 30, 2016 compared to November 1, 2015 are primarily due to the Broadcom Merger.\nThe $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to the increase in net income and the adjustments to net income for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax from share-based compensation.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures. The change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily relates to $10 billion paid for the Broadcom Merger, a $130 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and a $44 million increase in purchases of investments, partially offset by a $248 million increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses and a $104 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments.\nThe change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to $6.0 billion paid in aggregate for the LSI and PLX acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 and a $200 million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by $394 million paid primarily for the Emulex acquisition in fiscal year 2015 and a $184 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2015, primarily in connection with the expansion of our internal manufacturing facilities in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nFinancing Activities\nBroadcom\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, offset by the repayment of term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt, dividend payments by Broadcom, cash distributions by the Partnership and payments of debt issuance costs. The change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and a $54 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repayment of 2014 Term Loans, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt and a $342 million increase in dividend payments.\nThe change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to the proceeds of $4.6 billion from term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and $1 billion from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in fiscal year 2014, an increase in fiscal year 2015 for debt repayments of $1.8 billion and a $124 million increase in dividend payments, partially offset by a $117 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of our ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans and an $86 million increase in excess tax benefit.\nThe Partnership\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities for the Partnership are materially the same as those discussed for Broadcom above. The differences are due to capital transactions with the General Partner, which are a result of the capital contributions from Broadcom to the Partnership.\nIndebtedness\nSee Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n2016 Credit Agreement\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we made principal prepayments totaling $610 million on the Term B-1 Loan and fully repaid the \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan and the $500 million Term B-2 Loan. The paydown of the Term B-2 Loan was partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan borrowings. As a result, during fiscal year 2016, we wrote-off $40 million of debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn August 2016, we amended the 2016 Credit Agreement and refinanced all of the outstanding Term B-1 Loans into the Term B-3 Loans and increased the amount of outstanding Term A Loans, or the August 2016 Amendments. The August 2016 Amendments reduced the applicable margins on the outstanding balance under the Term B-3 Loans and increased our operating flexibility, including the automatic release of all collateral securing the 2016 Term Loans upon the repayment of all outstanding Term B-3 Loans and our achievement of the specified investment grade ratings. As a result of the August 2016 Amendments, we wrote-off $49 million of our previously deferred debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThe 2016 Term Loans bear interest at floating rates which were 2.28% for the Term A Loans and 3.53% for the Term B-3 Loans as of October 30, 2016.\nAs of October 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loans, net of the unaccreted discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, was $13.5 billion. As of October 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility or material outstanding letters of credit.\nWe were in compliance with all of the covenants described in the 2016 Credit Agreement as of October 30, 2016. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the aggregate 2016 Term Loans and/or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of October 30, 2016 (in millions):\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt principal, interest and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plan contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Principal, Interest and Fees. Represents principal, interest and commitment fees payable on borrowings and credit facilities under the 2016 Credit Agreement and outstanding senior unsecured notes that we assumed as a result of the Broadcom Merger.\nPurchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new\ncampuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and, therefore, cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above.\nOther Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. Represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.\nPension Plan Contribution. Represents our planned minimum contributions to our pension plans. Although additional future contributions will be required, the amount and timing of these contributions will be affected by actuarial assumptions, the actual rate of returns on plan assets, the level of market interest rates, legislative changes and the amount of voluntary contributions to the plans. The amount shown in the table represents our planned contributions to our pension plans within a year. Because any contributions for fiscal year 2018 and later will depend on the value of the plan assets in the future and thus are uncertain, we have not included any amounts for fiscal year 2018 and beyond in the above table.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2016, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $893 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2016 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at October 30, 2016 as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\nIndemnifications\nSee Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBroadcom is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited, or Avago. We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We have four reportable segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial & other, which align with our principal target markets.\nBroadcom Cayman L.P., or the Partnership, is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands in order to effect the business combination between Avago and Broadcom Corporation, or BRCM. Pursuant to the amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement, or the Partnership Agreement, it authorized its common partnership units and restricted exchangeable limited partnership units, or Partnership REUs. The Partnership REUs are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and the Partnership is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Broadcom, its General Partner, has the exclusive right, power and authority to manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs and to make decisions regarding the undertaking and business of the Partnership in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and applicable laws. There is no board of directors of the Partnership.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. We also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc.\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:\n \u2022 general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets; \n \u2022 our ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce and market, new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner; \n \u2022 the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders; \n \u2022 the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; and \n \u2022 the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products.  Current uncertainty in global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in the United States and the level of growth in China, still poses significant risks to our business. For example, customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nOn February 1, 2016, or the Acquisition Date, we acquired BRCM for approximately $35.7 billion in ordinary shares, Partnership REUs, and cash, which is discussed in greater detail below under Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d. Since the Acquisition Date, we divested substantially all of the non-core BRCM businesses held-for-sale generating aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million in fiscal year 2016. Non-core BRCM businesses are presented as discontinued operations, and have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn addition to the acquisition of BRCM, highlights during fiscal year 2016 include the following:\n \u2022 Our cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016, compared with $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations during fiscal year 2016. \n \u2022 Broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends on its ordinary shares of $716 million, and the Partnership made aggregate distributions of $34 million on its Partnership REUs during fiscal year 2016. \n \u2022 As a result of our acquisition of BRCM, our outstanding debt increased by $11.7 billion, which we have reduced by $2 billion through cash generated from operations and the sale of non-core BRCM businesses noted above since the Acquisition Date. \nNet Revenue\nSubstantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products. Our four reportable segments are wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. Applications for our products in these segments include enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments, has varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality, which is discussed in detail below under Seasonality\u201d.\nWe use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. Sales to distributors accounted for 30% and 21% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Historically, a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2016, Foxconn Technology Group companies (including Hon Hai Precision Industries), or together referred to as Foxconn, accounted for 14% of our net revenue, and our top ten direct customers, which also included four distributors, collectively accounted for 50% of our net revenue. During fiscal year 2015, Foxconn accounted for 24% of our net revenue and our top ten direct customers, which also included three distributors, collectively accounted for 58% of our net revenue. We believe our aggregate sales to Apple, Inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with our sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes (which includes Foxconn), accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2016 and more than 20% for fiscal year 2015. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten direct or indirect customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, some of our key customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true in our wireless communications segment as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of, and seasonal variations in, sales of mobile handsets, as well as changes in the overall economic environment.\nIn recent years, approximately 50% of our net revenue has come from sales to distributors, OEMs or contract manufacturers located in China. However, the end-customers for our products, or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China. As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product, or our customers' product incorporating our product, to end-customers located in China.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal cost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, and the cost of assembly and testing of those products. Cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, including share-based compensation, and related occupancy, computer services and equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty and inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, energy costs, other manufacturing expenses and acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs and integration-related costs. Total cost of products sold also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including share-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated\nfacilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including share-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, costs of advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognized intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years. We also recognized goodwill and in-process research and development, which are not amortized, in connection with acquisitions.\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, in-process research and development impairment, fixed asset impairment, facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of the original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt, expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding indebtedness, we incur a loss on the extinguishment of debt.\nOther income, net. Other income, net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities, gains on the sale of cost-method investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items.\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that qualifying income we earn in Singapore is subject to tax holiday or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a corporate headquarters function and specified intellectual property, or IP, activities in Singapore. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2020 and 2025, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have tax holidays on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which are scheduled to expire between 2018 and 2028. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $169 million, $207 million and $99 million, respectively.\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.\nGoing forward, our overall effective tax rate and cash taxes payable will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time and timing of distributions of earnings. In particular, we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside Singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis, potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods. Our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nBroadcom Corporation\nOn February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Broadcom Agreement, by and among Broadcom, Avago, BRCM, the Partnership, and certain other subsidiaries of Broadcom, (i) Broadcom acquired Avago pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement, or the Avago Scheme, in which all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Avago issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Avago Scheme were exchanged on a one-for-one basis, for newly issued ordinary shares of Broadcom, and (ii) thereafter, two subsidiaries of Broadcom merged with and into BRCM with BRCM as the surviving corporation of each such merger, or the Broadcom Merger, in which BRCM shareholders received, in aggregate, approximately $16.8 billion in cash, 112 million of Broadcom ordinary shares and 23 million Partnership REUs in exchange for all shares of BRCM common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Broadcom Merger. In addition, we also paid $137 million in cash for vested BRCM equity awards. Broadcom also assumed unvested restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, originally granted by BRCM and converted them into 6 million Broadcom RSUs. Following the consummation of the Avago Scheme and the Broadcom Merger, or the Broadcom Transaction, each of Avago and BRCM became indirect subsidiaries of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Broadcom Merger was approximately $35.7 billion. We funded the cash portion of the Broadcom Merger with net proceeds from the issuance of $15.6 billion in term loans under a new collateralized credit facility, as amended from time to time, or the 2016 Credit Agreement, that we entered into at the time of closing of the Broadcom Merger, which is discussed in detail in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as cash on hand of the combined companies. The financial results provided in this Form 10-K include the results of operations of BRCM commencing as of the Acquisition Date.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we made several other acquisitions to enhance our competitive position. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired Emulex Corporation, or Emulex, a leader in network connectivity, monitoring and management, for a purchase price of $587 million. In fiscal year 2014, we acquired LSI Corporation, or LSI, a provider of high-performance storage and networking semiconductors used in hard disk drives, solid state drives, communication systems, computer servers, storage systems and personal computers, for a purchase price of $6.5 billion. In fiscal year 2014, we also acquired PLX Technology, Inc., or PLX, a provider of PCI Express, or PCIe, semiconductor and software connectivity solutions, for $308 million.\nThe discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates.\nSee Note 3. Acquisitions\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPending Acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Brocade Agreement, by and among Broadcom, BRCM, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Brocade, and Bobcat Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BRCM, or Merger Sub. The Brocade Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Brocade with Brocade as the surviving corporation, or the Brocade Merger. As a result of the Brocade Merger, Brocade will become an indirect subsidiary of Broadcom and the Partnership.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, at the effective time of the Brocade Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Brocade common stock held by Brocade stockholders who do not perfect their appraisal rights with respect to the Brocade Merger will be converted into the right to receive $12.75 in cash, without interest. The Brocade Merger is currently valued at $5.5 billion plus $0.4 billion of net debt. We intend to finance the transaction with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe will also assume certain vested (to the extent not in-the-money) and all unvested Brocade stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units held by continuing employees and service providers. All vested in-the-money Brocade stock options, after giving effect to any acceleration, and all other restricted stock units and performance stock units will be cashed out at the effective time of the Brocade Merger.\nBrocade has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement, including, without limitation, covenants not to solicit alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction. Each of Broadcom, BRCM and\nMerger Sub, or collectively, the Broadcom Parties, also has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Brocade Agreement.\nConsummation of the Brocade Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including adoption of the Brocade Agreement by Brocade stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the receipt of regulatory clearance under certain other laws and the absence of certain pending governmental litigation with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Brocade Agreement.\nUnder the Brocade Agreement, Brocade has agreed to cooperate with us to facilitate the sale, disposition or other transfer of its IP Networking business, including its recently acquired Ruckus Wireless business. The consummation of the Brocade Merger is not conditioned on the divestiture of Brocade's IP Networking business.\nThe Brocade Agreement contains certain termination rights for BRCM and Brocade, and further provides that, upon termination of the Brocade Agreement under certain specified circumstances, Brocade will be obligated to pay us a termination fee of $195 million.\nWe currently expect the Brocade Merger to close in the second half of our fiscal year 2017.\nDivestitures\nSale of BRCM Businesses\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we completed the sales of certain non-core BRCM businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $36 million.\nSale of LSI Businesses\nOn September 2, 2014, we sold the LSI Flash business and related assets to Seagate Technology LLC for $450 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $18 million.\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold the LSI Axxia networking business and related assets to Intel Corporation for $650 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory valuation, income taxes, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation and employee bonus programs.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.\nBusiness combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical\nestimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nValuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets including purchased in-process research and development, assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long-lived asset relates to, consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nInventory valuation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.\nIncome taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. If we determine, in the future, that a valuation allowance is required, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine, in the future, a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in Singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist.\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs over the employees' average expected future service to us, based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of GAAP. One critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs. Other important assumptions include the expected long-term return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates - October 30, 2016 and November 1, 2015, for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans, in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. For fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high- quality corporate bond yields, depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense.\nWe base our salary increase assumptions on historical experience and future expectations. In developing the expected rate of return, we consider long-term compound annualized returns based on historical market data, historical and expected returns on the various categories of plan assets, and the target investment portfolio allocation among debt, equity securities and other investments.\nActuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment. Material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is the key assumption in calculating U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated $43 million impact on the benefit obligations as of October 30, 2016. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2017.\nShare-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense consists of expense for share options and restricted share units, or RSUs, granted to employees and non-employees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with Broadcom employee share purchase plan. We recognize compensation expense for share options based on the estimated grant-date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we granted share price performance options, which are accounted for as market-based share options. In fiscal year 2015, we began granting share price performance RSUs instead, which are accounted for as market-based RSUs. The fair value of these market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our time-based option awards.\nEmployee Bonus Programs. Our employee bonus programs, which are overseen by our Compensation Committee or our Board, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall\ncorporate annual targets and functional performance metrics. In the first fiscal quarter of the year, if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a variable, proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100% achievement of the targets and metrics. The bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100% and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved. In subsequent quarters, we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics. The actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year, which is subject to approval by our Compensation Committee, may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters, which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nFiscal Year Presentation\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year which ends on the Sunday closest to October 31. Each of fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted of 52 weeks.\nThe financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with GAAP and expressed in U.S. dollars.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\n\nNet Revenue\nThe following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented:\n\n\nOur overall net revenue increased primarily due to the contributions from acquired BRCM products since the closing of the Broadcom Merger on the Acquisition Date. As a result of the Broadcom Merger, our wired infrastructure segment now constitutes our largest segment.\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the contributions since the Acquisition Date from acquired BRCM products included in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to revenue contributions of approximately $1.8 billion from sales of acquired BRCM wireless connectivity and\nrelated products since the Acquisition Date, partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately $525 million in sales of our radio frequency, or RF, components due to reduced demand from a key North American smartphone customer. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to the additional revenue resulting from a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment remained essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2015. Our net revenue in fiscal year 2016 also included $450 million from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP, compared to $313 million in fiscal year 2015, which primarily benefited our wired infrastructure and industrial & other segments.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $5.9 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions to our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments from the BRCM businesses acquired in February 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 45% and 52% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 7% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was largely due to $1.2 billion of costs resulting from the step-up of inventory to fair value and the increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the Broadcom Merger.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $1.6 billion, or 155% in fiscal year 2016. Research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 20% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 15% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in research and development expense dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in research and development expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $320 million, or 66% in fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 6% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 7% for fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the acquired BRCM businesses and the acquisition-related costs. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the realization of synergies resulting from the integration of BRCM. Share-based compensation included in selling, general and administrative expense increased due to RSUs assumed in connection with, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger, as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $2.6 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $733 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the Broadcom Merger.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges, recognized primarily in operating expenses, were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared to $144 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was due primarily to the Broadcom Merger, including impairment charges of $417 million for termination of in-process research and development projects and $173 million for property, plant and equipment. Restructuring charges were due primarily to employee termination costs of approximately $418 million, and lease termination and other exit costs of $29 million, primarily resulting from the BRCM acquisition. We expect to incur approximately additional $50 million of restructuring charges in future periods as a result of the Broadcom Merger. We may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of any future acquisitions, particularly our pending acquisition of Brocade.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: \nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to contributions from the acquired BRCM wired products. Operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to contributions from the BRCM wireless connectivity products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our RF components from a key North American smartphone customer. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to a full year of contributions from the Emulex business that we acquired in May 2015, as well as strength in demand for our HDD products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was flat.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 368% in fiscal year 2016, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increases in charges related to the step-up of inventory to fair value, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, and costs incurred in connection with the Broadcom Merger. Additionally, share-based compensation increased due to RSUs assumed in, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $585 million for fiscal year 2016 and $191 million for fiscal year 2015. The increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to interest on higher outstanding debt balances and expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees, in each case associated with the term loan indebtedness we incurred to finance the Broadcom Merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. During fiscal year 2016, in connection with the closing of the Broadcom Merger, we repaid in full our term loan borrowings under a collateralized credit agreement with lenders named therein entered into in fiscal year 2014, or the 2014 Credit Agreement. We subsequently repaid our \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan (defined below) partially funded by the sale of certain acquired BRCM assets that were held for sale. We also repaid our $500 million Term B-2 Loan (defined below), partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan (defined below) borrowings. These payments and the August 2016 Amendments (defined below) resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $123 million for fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we made a $593 million principal prepayment on term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and settled the 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, or the Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million for fiscal year 2015.\nIn connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, three Broadcom subsidiaries entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement, which originally provided for a Term A loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.4 billion, or the Term A Loan, a Term B-1 dollar loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $9.8 billion, or the Term B-1 Loan, a Term B-1 euro loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of \u20ac900 million, equivalent to $978 million as of February 1, 2016, or the Term B-1 Euro Loan, a Term B-2 loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million, or the Term B-2 Loan, and together with the Term A Loan, Term B-1 Loan, and Term B-1 Euro Loan, referred to as the 2016 Term Loans. The 2016 Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility, or the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, that permits us to borrow from time to time in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million for working capital and other corporate purposes, including swingline loans of up to $150 million in the aggregate and for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $100 million in the aggregate, which, in the case of swingline loans and letters of credit, reduce the available borrowing capacity under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar for dollar basis.\nProvision for income taxes. For fiscal year 2016, we had a provision for income taxes of $642 million compared to $76 million for fiscal year 2015. The income tax provision for the fiscal year 2016 is primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings, partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we determined that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated and current foreign earnings in our operations outside of Singapore. As a result, we made a provision for taxes on $1.9 billion of our undistributed earnings as of November 1, 2015, including projected withholding taxes that would become payable upon the distribution of those earnings, and recognized $93 million of expense in fiscal year 2016 related to the undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.\nAt the time we completed the Broadcom Merger, in connection with the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, we established a deferred tax liability that is associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of BRCM's IP, which was completed in November 2016. This tax liability will become payable as earnings resulting from this integration of IP are distributed over time.\nAs a result of these events, the amount of our income taxes payable could increase materially and consume an increasing amount of our cash. In addition, our provision for income taxes in future periods is likely to change as a result of the impact of internal restructuring and reorganization, in particular as a result of the Broadcom Merger, which would also affect our overall effective tax rate.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented: \nNet Revenue\nThe following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented: \n\nNet revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased 28% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved revenue contributions from our application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and from the inclusion of a full year of contributions from LSI products in this segment. Net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased 50% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to a substantial increase in our RF product content in smartphones and an increase in unit sales of smartphones containing our products. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased 151% in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014. This segment was acquired in the LSI acquisition and fiscal year 2015 results reflect a full year of operating results compared to a partial year of operating results in fiscal year 2014. The results for fiscal year 2015 also reflect contributions from Emulex following its acquisition and an improvement in the business due to market share gains as well as growth in end market demand. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment increased 12% in fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to an increase in IP licensing revenue. Net revenue for fiscal year 2015 included $313 million of revenue from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP compared to $160 million for fiscal year 2014.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2014, an increase of $1.7 billion. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 52% for fiscal year 2015, compared to 44% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in gross margin, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to gross margin contributions from our enterprise storage segment, which we acquired in the LSI acquisition, an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products, and a decrease in charges associated with the inventory step-up to fair value related to acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $354 million or 51% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense remained relatively flat at 15% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 16% for fiscal year 2014. The majority of the increase in dollars was related primarily to the impact of LSI and PLX for the full fiscal year, the impact of Emulex for the second half of fiscal year 2015, and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $79 million or 19% in fiscal year 2015. However, as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 7% for fiscal year 2015 compared to 10% for fiscal year 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense, in dollars, was primarily due to the impact of the LSI acquisition for the full fiscal year and an increase in share-based compensation expense due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2015, as revenue growth outpaced the increase in selling, general and administrative expense.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nTotal amortization expense of intangible assets was $733 million and $446 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, an increase of $287 million. The increase in amortization expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization for intangible assets obtained in the LSI and PLX acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\nWe incurred total restructuring and asset impairment charges of $144 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $162 million for fiscal year 2014. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year 2015 were primarily due to employee termination costs related to the Emulex and LSI acquisitions. The restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 were due primarily to employee termination costs related to the LSI acquisition.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we realigned certain product groups within our wired infrastructure segment and agreed to sell certain fiber optics subsystems assets to a third party. As a result, we recognized a $61 million loss to write these assets down to fair value less costs to sell.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following tables set forth operating income by segment for the periods presented: \nOperating income from our wired infrastructure segment was 32% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 67% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to gross margin improvement and higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our wireless communications segment was 47% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 83%, compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue and improvement in product mix. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment was 39% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 193% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher revenue with stable research and development expense. Operating income from our industrial & other segment was 49% of segment revenue. Operating income increased 26% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher IP licensing revenue.\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 16% compared with fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increases in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets incurred in connection with our acquisitions of LSI, PLX and Emulex. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased in fiscal year 2015, compared with fiscal year 2014, due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and higher headcount as a result of the LSI, PLX and Emulex acquisitions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $191 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $110 million for fiscal year 2014. This $81 million increase in interest expense was due to the full year interest on our outstanding 2014 Term Loans, along with the amortization of related debt issuance costs that were being charged to interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective borrowing terms.\nProvision for income taxes. We recognized a provision for income taxes of $76 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $33 million for fiscal year 2014. The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2015 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in profit before tax.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment. This segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly in the wireless communications and enterprise storage segments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2016 consisted of: (1) $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations, (3) our outstanding revolving credit facility of up to $500 million aggregate\nprincipal amount, or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which is committed until February 1, 2021, and substantially all of which was available to be drawn as of October 30, 2016, and (4) our ability to increase the aggregate term loans and revolving credit commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement, referred to as the accordion feature, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2016 Credit Agreement and the availability of commitments. The 2016 Credit Agreement was entered in connection with the completion of the Broadcom Merger, and replaced our 2014 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement is discussed in more detail under in Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, including the Brocade Merger, (v) interim cash dividend payments by Broadcom (if and when declared by the Board), (vi) cash distributions by the Partnership (if and when declared by the Partnership's general partner), (vii) payment of income taxes, including taxes paid as a result of the intercompany transfer of IP acquired in the Broadcom Merger, and (viii) funding employee benefit plan obligations. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be higher than fiscal year 2016, due primarily to expenditures for construction at our Irvine and San Jose campuses, continued expenditures for capacity expansion in our Fort Collins internal fabrication facility, spending on equipment to support various research and development projects and purchases of test manufacturing equipment.\nOur debt and liquidity needs will also increase as a result of the closing of the Brocade Merger. We intend to finance the estimated $5.5 billion of cash consideration with cash on hand from both companies and new debt financing.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations, combined with current borrowing availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the accordion feature in our 2016 Credit Agreement, as well as committed debt funding related to the pending Brocade Merger, provide sufficient liquidity, after giving effect to the pending Brocade Merger, to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations, for at least the next 12 months.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement, or otherwise, to fund the transaction. We could also reduce certain expenditures such as payment of our cash dividend. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances we may also seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur, including under the 2016 Term Loans and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\nWe may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities, or otherwise increase our outstanding indebtedness, for reasons other than those specified above.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares for $12 million. We did not repurchase any shares in fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\nShare repurchases under our share repurchase programs were made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as we deemed appropriate.\nSummary and Highlights\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion at October 30, 2016 from $1.8 billion at November 1, 2015. The increase was largely due to $3.4 billion in net cash provided by operating activities, $19.5 billion of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans, $898 million of aggregate proceeds received from the sales of businesses and $295 million from the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercises of share options and purchase rights under Broadcom's employee share purchase plan, partially offset by $10 billion in cash paid in the Broadcom Merger, the repayment of $9.8 billion, in aggregate principal amount, of our term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and a portion of the 2016 Term Loans, the repayment of $1.5 billion of debt assumed in the Broadcom Merger, $750 million in dividend payments by Broadcom and cash distributions by the Partnership (discussed in more detail below), $723 million in capital expenditures, and $123 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Term Loans.\nDividends/Distributions\nBroadcom paid aggregate cash dividends of $1.94 and $1.55 per ordinary share, or $716 million and $408 million, during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Partnership paid aggregate cash distributions of $594 million to Broadcom, as General Partner, and cash distributions of $1.50 per Partnership REU, or $34 million, to its limited partners during fiscal year 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities represents net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to the adjustments to net loss for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of a net loss during fiscal 2016. The adjustments to net loss for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges and deferred taxes. Changes in assets and liabilities as of October 30, 2016 compared to November 1, 2015 are primarily due to the Broadcom Merger.\nThe $1.1 billion increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to the increase in net income and the adjustments to net income for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, as well as restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax from share-based compensation.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures. The change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily relates to $10 billion paid for the Broadcom Merger, a $130 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and a $44 million increase in purchases of investments, partially offset by a $248 million increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses and a $104 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments.\nThe change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to $6.0 billion paid in aggregate for the LSI and PLX acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 and a $200 million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by $394 million paid primarily for the Emulex acquisition in fiscal year 2015 and a $184 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2015, primarily in connection with the expansion of our internal manufacturing facilities in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nFinancing Activities\nBroadcom\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, offset by the repayment of term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt, dividend payments by Broadcom, cash distributions by the Partnership and payments of debt issuance costs. The change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to proceeds from the 2016 Term Loans and a $54 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repayment of 2014 Term Loans, prepayments made on our 2016 Term Loans, the payment of assumed debt and a $342 million increase in dividend payments.\nThe change in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily relates to the proceeds of $4.6 billion from term loan borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement and $1 billion from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in fiscal year 2014, an increase in fiscal year 2015 for debt repayments of $1.8 billion and a $124 million increase in dividend payments, partially offset by a $117 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of our ordinary shares through employee equity incentive plans and an $86 million increase in excess tax benefit.\nThe Partnership\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities for the Partnership are materially the same as those discussed for Broadcom above. The differences are due to capital transactions with the General Partner, which are a result of the capital contributions from Broadcom to the Partnership.\nIndebtedness\nSee Note 8. Borrowings\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n2016 Credit Agreement\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we made principal prepayments totaling $610 million on the Term B-1 Loan and fully repaid the \u20ac900 million Term B-1 Euro Loan and the $500 million Term B-2 Loan. The paydown of the Term B-2 Loan was partially funded with $325 million of additional Term A Loan borrowings. As a result, during fiscal year 2016, we wrote-off $40 million of debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn August 2016, we amended the 2016 Credit Agreement and refinanced all of the outstanding Term B-1 Loans into the Term B-3 Loans and increased the amount of outstanding Term A Loans, or the August 2016 Amendments. The August 2016 Amendments reduced the applicable margins on the outstanding balance under the Term B-3 Loans and increased our operating flexibility, including the automatic release of all collateral securing the 2016 Term Loans upon the repayment of all outstanding Term B-3 Loans and our achievement of the specified investment grade ratings. As a result of the August 2016 Amendments, we wrote-off $49 million of our previously deferred debt issuance costs, which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThe 2016 Term Loans bear interest at floating rates which were 2.28% for the Term A Loans and 3.53% for the Term B-3 Loans as of October 30, 2016.\nAs of October 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loans, net of the unaccreted discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, was $13.5 billion. As of October 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility or material outstanding letters of credit.\nWe were in compliance with all of the covenants described in the 2016 Credit Agreement as of October 30, 2016. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the aggregate 2016 Term Loans and/or 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of October 30, 2016 (in millions):\n\nDebt Principal, Interest and Fees. Represents principal, interest and commitment fees payable on borrowings and credit facilities under the 2016 Credit Agreement and outstanding senior unsecured notes that we assumed as a result of the Broadcom Merger.\nPurchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new\ncampuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and, therefore, cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above.\nOther Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. Represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.\nPension Plan Contribution. Represents our planned minimum contributions to our pension plans. Although additional future contributions will be required, the amount and timing of these contributions will be affected by actuarial assumptions, the actual rate of returns on plan assets, the level of market interest rates, legislative changes and the amount of voluntary contributions to the plans. The amount shown in the table represents our planned contributions to our pension plans within a year. Because any contributions for fiscal year 2018 and later will depend on the value of the plan assets in the future and thus are uncertain, we have not included any amounts for fiscal year 2018 and beyond in the above table.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2016, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $893 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2016 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at October 30, 2016 as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\nIndemnifications\nSee Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for Broadcom, successor to Avago Technologies, is a detailed section found within the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. It should be read along with the financial statements, notes, and selected financial data also included in the report. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.\n\nBroadcom specializes in the design, development, and supply of various semiconductor devices, broadly used in networking, connectivity, smartphones, data centers, telecommunication, automation, power generation, and displays, among other applications. The company operates in four primary segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial & other. After acquiring BRCM, Broadcom on February 1, 2016, for about $35.7 billion, they divested non-core BRCM businesses bringing in $830 million in fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe demand for Broadcom's products can be influenced by economic conditions, product development and marketing, customer orders, adoption rates, and competition. In terms of financial highlights for the fiscal year, the company had a cash reserve of $3.1 billion as of October 30, 2016, generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, paid $716 million in dividends on its shares, and reduced its debt by $2 billion post-acquisition.\n\nRevenue generation by segment reflects the impact of acquisitions and the changing market demands, with notable increases in wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments owing to BRCM products. However, Broadcom's enterprise storage and industrial & other segments experienced less dramatic changes.\n\nCosts and expenses entailed product production, assembly, testing, personnel, overhead, restructuring, impairment, and acquisition-related costs, including inventory adjustments and amortization. Research and development, as well as selling, general, and administrative costs, rose notably, attributable to the increase in personnel following acquisitions and share-based compensation expenses.\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, Broadcom posted notable figures: total net revenue of $13.2 billion, total cost of products sold at $7.3 billion, gross margin of $5.9 billion, total operating expenses at $6.3 billion, resulting in an operating loss of $409 million.\n\nRevenue by segment experienced variability, attributable to demand fluctuation, seasonality, and economic factors. In recent years, about 50% of Broadcom's net revenue originated from sales to China.\n\nThe future economic conditions, including recovery in the U.S. and growth in China, pose risk factors for the business. Customers may delay purchases due to financial uncertainties, affecting demand and operating results.\n\nThe report also covers aspects of taxation, with Broadcom structured to benefit from tax incentives in various jurisdictions, while also keeping an eye on future tax liabilities arising from undistributed foreign earnings and restructuring.\n\nIn terms of acquisitions and divestitures, the document highlights key transactions, including the acquisition of Emulex Corporation and the sale of the LSI Flash business to Seagate Technology LLC.\n\nThe report also addresses critical accounting estimates such as revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of assets and goodwill, inventory valuation, and income taxes.\n\nThe company's fiscal years operated on a 52- or 53-week basis, ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Each of the fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of 52 weeks, and the financial statements follow U.S. GAAP, expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe report discusses results of operations, comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, with tables detailing net revenue, cost of products sold, operating income (loss), restructuring charges, and segment operating results.\n\nLastly, the MD&A outlines Broadcom's liquidity and capital resources, contractual commitments, and potential off-balance sheet arrangements, indicating that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its current and future obligations."}
