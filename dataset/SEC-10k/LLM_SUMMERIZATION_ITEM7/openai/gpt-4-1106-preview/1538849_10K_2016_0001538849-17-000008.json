This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, Items 1., 1A. and 8. (which includes our consolidated financial statements) included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCST's Merger Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Circle K Stores Inc. will, through its acquisition of CST, control CST's interest in the General Partner and CST's 19.8% limited partner interest in us as well as all of the IDRs. The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States and Canada. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. See CST's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 11, 2016.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nThe Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nWholesale segment\nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 87% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increase and decrease corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2.2 million related to these payment discounts.\nRetail segment\nThe prices we pay for wholesale motor fuel are closely correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly and rapidly over short periods of time.\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices over the same period. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines rapidly.\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher terms discount as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 5, 2016, we purchased independent dealer and subwholesaler contracts from CST for $2.9 million.

This decrease was offset by higher costs associated with the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions in 2015.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions.\nGains on sales of assets, net\nGains on sales of assets, net, increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. The net gain recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the sale of individual sites and the divestiture of certain assets acquired in the PMI acquisition.\nIncome tax benefit\nThe income tax benefit increased from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit for both periods was due primarily to losses reported by LGWS.\nSegment Results\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistent with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nWholesale\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Wholesale segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of distribution sites and per gallon amounts):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

EBITDA represents net income available to us before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unit-holders.\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated by our operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuances of equity and debt securities. We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital, including sale-leaseback financing of real property with third parties, to support our liquidity requirements.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures, and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(311,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(156,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions.

At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participate in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$550 million revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,558\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.53% as of December 31, 2016 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.25% as of December 31, 2016). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016 totaled $6.5 million. The credit facility is secured by\nsubstantially all of the assets of CrossAmerica and its subsidiaries. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 24, 2017, was $84.2 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least, in the aggregate, $20 million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.16 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn December 2016, the credit facility was amended as summarized below:\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Modified certain terms to permit the acquisition of the Partnership's general partner indirectly by Couche-Tard;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduced the threshold for qualifying as a material acquisition\u201d from $50 million to $30 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extended the time period from two to three quarters that the leverage ratio following a material acquisition can be 5.00 : 1.00;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Created further flexibility to conduct sale leaseback transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased swing-line loan capacity from $10 million to $25 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain other operational and technical amendments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Renegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and 8 months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value on the date of the reclassification, which approximated its carrying value. During the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified the liability from debt and capital lease obligations to accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every 5 years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and will amortize this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe following table outlines our consolidated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

include estimates of interest expense related to our credit facility assuming a 3.5% interest rate.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by CST, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nManagement Fees\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and excludes other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2016.\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 385 million gallons in 2017, reducing to 25 million gallons in 2021. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2022 through 2024 total 75 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nConcentration of Customers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed approximately 16% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 26% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 21% of our rent income from CST. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received 9% of our rent income from a lessee dealer that operates many of the sites acquired through the PMI and One Stop acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed approximately 17% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 36% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed 7% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 17% of our rent income from CST. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCrossAmerica Common Unit Offering\nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nOn September 21, 2015, CST announced that the independent executive committee of its board of directors approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during the year ended December 31, 2016. From inception until December 31, 2016, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements. The Merger Agreement precludes CST from making any further purchases of CrossAmerica common units.\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. The Merger Agreement precludes us from making any further repurchases of our common units.

See Notes 3 and 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million.

Of the 34 company operated retail sites, 31 are located in Wisconsin and 3 are located in Minnesota. The acquisition was funded by borrowings under our credit facility.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContingencies\nLegal Matters\nSee Note 16 under the caption Litigation Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our legal matters.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nSee Note 22 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nOutlook\nThis outlook section does not take into account or give any effect to the impact of CST's proposed Merger on our business.

Risk Factors-The pending Merger could adversely impact our business and strategic plans for growth.\u201d\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we expect our total motor fuel volume sold for 2017 to be higher than 2016 volumes. While the U.S. energy markets, including wholesale and retail motor fuel prices, are likely to continue to be volatile in the coming year, crude prices increased in the latter part of 2016 and have remained at those levels in early 2017, which supports the payment terms discount component of our motor fuel gross margin on an absolute basis while this price increase negatively impacts our retail motor fuel gross margin in our Retail Segment. We expect our rent income to increase in 2017 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, accretive to our unitholders, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nNew Accounting Policies\nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. Acquisitions of assets or entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs are accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 3 to the consolidated and statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value\u201d of goodwill. The determination of our implied fair value\u201d requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value\u201d of goodwill, which is compared to the corresponding carrying value. If the implied fair value\u201d is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, and considering valuation data of our reporting units as provided by a third party independent appraisal firm, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nWe base our estimates of such future costs on our prior experience with removal and include normal and customary costs we expect to incur associated with UST removal. We compare our cost estimates with our actual removal cost experience on an annual basis, and when the actual costs we experience exceed our original estimates, we will recognize an additional liability for estimated future costs to remove the USTs. Because these estimates are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs, the dollar amount of these obligations could change as more information is obtained.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $27.8 million and $23.5 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2016 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.4 million. See also Note 11 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $4.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2016 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million.\nSee also Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nTax Matters\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to CrossAmerica's taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. CrossAmerica is subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 CST's Merger Agreement-This section provides information on the pending Merger. \n \u2022 Significant Factors Affecting Our Profitability-This section describes the significant impact on our results of operations caused by crude oil commodity price volatility, seasonality and acquisition and financing activities. \n \u2022 Results of Operations-This section provides an analysis of our results of operations, including the results of operations of our business segments, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, an outlook for our business and non-GAAP financial measures. \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources-This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and cash flows. It also includes a discussion of our debt, capital requirements and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources. \n \u2022 New Accounting Policies-This section describes new accounting pronouncements that we have already adopted, those that we are required to adopt in the future, and those that became applicable in the current year as a result of new circumstances. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates-This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. \nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, Items 1., 1A. and 8. (which includes our consolidated financial statements) included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCST's Merger Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Circle K Stores Inc. will, through its acquisition of CST, control CST's interest in the General Partner and CST's 19.8% limited partner interest in us as well as all of the IDRs. The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States and Canada. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. See CST's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 11, 2016.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nThe Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nWholesale segment\nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 87% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increase and decrease corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2.2 million related to these payment discounts.\nRetail segment\nThe prices we pay for wholesale motor fuel are closely correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly and rapidly over short periods of time.\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices over the same period. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines rapidly.\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher terms discount as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\n \u2022 On February 5, 2016, we purchased independent dealer and subwholesaler contracts from CST for $2.9 million. See Notes 3 and 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores and company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On July 7, 2016, CST provided an $18.2 million refund payment to us related to our interest in CST Fuel Supply. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2016, we acquired the State Oil Assets located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 13, 2016, we amended our credit facility to provide additional flexibility to support achieving our growth strategy. See Note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2016, we sold the real property at 17 fee sites acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition for $25.0 million in proceeds, which were used to repay borrowings under the credit facility. We then leased these sites back under a triple net lease agreement. See Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In January 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 1.5 million common units. See Notes 3 and 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of 22 retail sites from Landmark, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In June 2015, we closed on the sale of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. In July 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units associated with the June offering. We used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility. See Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 12.5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 3.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Notes 3 and 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In March 2014, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement. The amended and restated credit facility is a senior secured revolving credit facility maturing March 4, 2019 with a total borrowing capacity of $550.0 million. \n \u2022 In April 2014, we acquired PMI for an aggregate purchase price of $73.5 million, including working capital, which resulted in the acquisition of 87 retail sites in Virginia and West Virginia. \n \u2022 In May 2014, we completed our acquisition of 52 wholesale supply contracts, one sub-wholesaler contract, five fee sites, six leasehold sites and certain other assets from affiliates of Atlas Oil Company for an aggregate purchase price of $39.2 million, including working capital. \n \u2022 In September 2014, we issued 4.1 million common units resulting in net proceeds of $135.0 million. We used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility. \n \u2022 On October 1, 2014, CST completed the GP Purchase and we entered into the Amended Omnibus Agreement. \n \u2022 In November 2014, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of Nice N Easy, we acquired the real property and underground storage tanks relating to 23 fee sites and the fuel distribution agreements with respect to 25 Nice N Easy retail sites for $53.8 million. \nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Income Statement Analysis\nBelow is an analysis of our consolidated statements of operations and provides the primary reasons for significant increases and decreases in the various income statement line items from period to period.

The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 per barrel during 2015. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \n \u25e6 A $29.5 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of low margin wholesale fuel supply contracts and other assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting this decline was a $15.0 million increase primarily related to rental income associated with the acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \n \u2022 A $205.2 million, or 31%, decline in our Retail segment revenues primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 A decline of $44.6 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. \n \u25e6 A decrease of $124.0 million from a 24% decrease in motor fuel volumes sold related to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental volume generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \n \u25e6 A $36.6 million decline in our merchandise revenues attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental merchandise revenues generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition.  Intersegment revenues\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\n \u2022 Our intersegment revenues decreased $116.9 million, primarily attributable to the declines in price and volume discussed above.  Cost of sales\nCost of sales declined $342.6 million as a result of the decline in the wholesale price and gallons sold of motor fuel as noted above. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $12.1 million primarily attributable to the integration of prior year acquisitions and other cost savings initiatives, which reduced expenses by approximately $9.9 million. Additionally, equity-based compensation expense decreased $1.2 million as a result of less equity awards being granted in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $6.2 million primarily driven by our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million due to additional borrowings during 2015 and 2016 to fund acquisitions.\nIncome tax benefit\nWe recorded income tax benefits of $0.5 million and $3.5 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the loss generated by our corporate subsidiaries. In addition, we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million during 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Results\nOperating revenues declined $438.6 million, or 16%, while gross profit increased $44.6 million, or 36%.\nOperating revenues\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\n \u2022 A $443.7 million, or 19%, decline in our Wholesale segment primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 An $879.7 million decline attributable to a decrease in the wholesale price of our motor fuel. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased 48% to $48.66 per barrel for 2015, compared to $93.17 per barrel for 2014. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting this decline was a $423.7 million increase primarily related to an 18.4% increase in volume from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Other revenues increased $13.0 million driven by additional rental income from the Nice N Easy, Landmark and NTI acquisitions, as well as our company operated retail sites being converted to lessee dealer sites during 2015. \n \u2022 A $160.1 million, or 31%, increase in our Retail segment primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 An increase of $242.5 million from a 55% increase in motor fuel volumes sold related to the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions. \n \u25e6 A $101.1 million increase in our merchandise revenues attributable to retail site operations from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting these revenue increases was a decline of $183.5 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above, as well as converting company operated retail sites to independent dealer sites.  Intersegment revenues\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\n \u2022 Our intersegment revenues increased $155.0 million, primarily attributable to an increase in our Wholesale segment selling motor fuel to the retail sites acquired in the One Stop and the Erickson acquisitions, which are included in our Retail segment.  Cost of sales\nCost of sales declined $483.2 million, primarily from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices, which were partially offset by an increase in volumes purchased by our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $6.8 million decrease in stock based compensation related to the accelerated vesting as a result of the GP Purchase in 2014. This decrease was offset by higher costs associated with the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions in 2015.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions.\nGains on sales of assets, net\nGains on sales of assets, net, increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. The net gain recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the sale of individual sites and the divestiture of certain assets acquired in the PMI acquisition.\nIncome tax benefit\nThe income tax benefit increased from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit for both periods was due primarily to losses reported by LGWS.\nSegment Results\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistent with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nWholesale\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Wholesale segment.

we netted lease executory costs such as real estate taxes, maintenance, and utilities that we paid and re-billed to customers on our statement of operations. During the first quarter of 2016, we began accounting for such amounts as rent income and operating expenses and reflected this change in presentation retrospectively. This change resulted in a $10.8 million and $8.9 million increase in rent and other income and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n (b) Represents income from our equity interest in CST Fuel Supply. \n (c) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \n (d) In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we distributed motor fuel to 14 and 17 sub-wholesalers who distributed to additional sites. \n (e) The increase in the independent dealer site count was primarily attributable to 21 independent dealer contracts assigned to us by CST and 25 wholesale fuel supply contracts acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition, partially offset by a net 13 terminated motor fuel supply contracts that were not renewed. \n (f) The increase in the lessee dealer site count was primarily attributable to converting 77 company operated retail sites in our Retail segment to lessee dealers in our Wholesale segment in 2016 and the 49 sites acquired in the September 2016 State Oil Assets acquisition. \n (g) The decrease in the DMS site count was primarily due to sites converted to a third party lessee dealer or commission agent. Through the first five years of the lease with DMS, the lease agreement allows for a limited number of sites to be removed from the lease by each of DMS and us. This right generally expires October 31, 2017. \n (h) The increase in the commission agent site count was primarily attributable to 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in 2016. \n (i) The decrease in the company operated retail site count was primarily attributable to 77 company operated retail sites being converted to lessee dealer sites in 2016, partially offset by the 31 Franchised Holiday Stores. \n (j) Does not include the motor fuel gallons distributed to sub-wholesalers. The decrease in independent dealer gallons sold per day are due to the divestiture of commercial wholesale supply contracts associated with the PMI acquisition, whereby gallons distributed are reduced but the site count is not affected. \n (k) Includes the wholesale gross margin for motor fuel distributed to sub-wholesalers. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe results were driven by:\nMotor Fuel Gross profit\nThe $4.5 million decrease in motor fuel gross profit was due to a $3.6 million decline primarily from decreased payment discounts and incentives due to the decline in motor fuel prices as a result of the decrease in crude oil and the remaining decline was primarily due to a decline in motor fuel gallons sold due to the termination of commercial wholesale fuel supply contracts and disposing certain terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 during 2015. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\nRent and other gross profit\nRent and other margin increased $12.9 million primarily as a result of our acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition in September 2016, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity\nIncome from our investment in CST Fuel Supply increased $5.5 million as a result of the additional 12.5% equity interest we acquired in July 2015, partially offset by CST's sale of its California and Wyoming retail sites.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $0.1 million primarily from a $5.2 million cost savings associated with disposing of certain transportation and terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses driven by our acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe results were driven by:\nMotor Fuel Gross profit\n \u2022 The decrease in gross profit was due to a decline of $13.2 million in our motor fuel gross profit primarily attributable to a decline in our payment discounts and incentives, which are discussed under the heading The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\u201d partially offset by an $11.1 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in motor fuel volume.  Rent and other gross profit\n \u2022 Rent and other margin increased $11.4 million primarily from our acquisitions, including the acquisition and leaseback of NTIs with CST, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.  Income from CST Fuel Supply\n \u2022 We recorded $10.5 million of income from our investment in CST Fuel Supply, which we acquired in January (5%) and July (12.5%) of 2015.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $1.2 million primarily as a result of incremental operating expenses from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of certain PMI assets during 2015. \nRetail\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Retail segment.

by:\nGross profit\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $10.9 million attributable to a 24% decrease in volume driven by the conversion of company operated retail sites acquired in prior acquisitions to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016 and a 42% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of crude oil prices being more volatile during the second half of 2015 than the second half of 2016 and the resulting impact on our motor fuel gross margin. The daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 35% during the last six months of 2015 compared to an increase of approximately 10% during the same period of 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \n \u2022 Our merchandise and services gross profit declined $11.6 million as a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of the change in product mix of our stores following our 2015 acquisitions and conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decline in operating expenses attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop and Franchised Holiday Stores acquisitions. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nGross profit increased $35.1 million, while operating expenses increased $23.3 million.\nThese results were driven by:\nGross profit\n \u2022 An $11.4 million increase in our motor fuel gross profit due to an increase in our cents per gallon gross profit associated with the lower wholesale cost of motor fuel and higher volumes associated with our acquisitions. \n \u2022 Our merchandise gross profit increased $24.1 million attributable to our acquisitions, while our merchandise gross profit percentage declined. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of our 2015 acquisitions. Additionally, we converted 52 company operated retail sites acquired in the PMI acquisition to lessee dealer sites during 2015, and these sites generally had a higher gross profit product mix.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 A $23.3 million increase in operating expenses attributable to our acquisitions. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio. EBITDA represents net income available to us before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unit-holders.\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital, including sale-leaseback financing of real property with third parties, to support our liquidity requirements.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures, and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(311,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(156,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $3.2 million more in management fees in equity with CST in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $36.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $8.9 million in management fees in equity in 2015 whereas all management fees were paid in cash in 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, $94.2 million of cash was used in the Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions and $2.9 million for independent dealer and subwholesaler contracts purchased from CST. We also incurred $20.8 million of capital expenditures and received $17.5 million in proceeds from the refund payment related to CST's sale of the California and Wyoming assets. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nDuring 2015, $167.8 million of cash was used in the Landmark, Erickson and One Stop acquisitions and $141.9 million on the acquisitions of CST's NTIs and CST Fuel Supply equity interests. We also had $10.2 million in capital expenditures.\nDuring 2014, $163.6 million of cash was used in the PMI, Atlas and Nice N Easy acquisitions and $14.0 million in capital expenditures. We received $15.7 million in proceeds on our sales of the lubricant business acquired as part of the PMI acquisition and the wholesale fuel supply contracts to DMI.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2016, we paid $83.6 million in distributions and purchased $3.3 million in common units under our common unit purchase program. We received $25.0 million in proceeds on the sale-leaseback transaction and had $83.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions.\nDuring 2015, we received $144.9 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $158.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We paid $66.1 million in distributions and purchased $3.6 million in common units under our common unit purchase program.\nDuring 2014, we received $135.0 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $54.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We also paid $41.5 million in distributions.\nRefund payment related to CST sale of California and Wyoming assets\nOn July 7, 2016, as approved by the independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST, CST provided a refund payment to the purchase price paid by us for our interest in CST Fuel Supply. The total refund payment received by us was approximately $18.2 million. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nDistributions\nDistribution activity for 2016 was as follows:\nTable 274: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Distribution (per unit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Distribution (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 24, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 19, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 8, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 4, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 13, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDRs\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we distributed $3.4 million and $1.4 million to CST with respect to the IDRs.\nExpiration of the Subordination Period\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, on February 25, 2016, the first business day after the payment of the fourth quarter 2015 distribution of $0.5925 per unit, the subordination period under the Partnership Agreement ended. At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participate in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$550 million revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncurrent portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,558\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.53% as of December 31, 2016 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.25% as of December 31, 2016). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016 totaled $6.5 million. The credit facility is secured by\nsubstantially all of the assets of CrossAmerica and its subsidiaries. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 24, 2017, was $84.2 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least, in the aggregate, $20 million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.16 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn December 2016, the credit facility was amended as summarized below:\n \u2022 Modified certain terms to permit the acquisition of the Partnership's general partner indirectly by Couche-Tard; \n \u2022 Reduced the threshold for qualifying as a material acquisition\u201d from $50 million to $30 million; \n \u2022 Extended the time period from two to three quarters that the leverage ratio following a material acquisition can be 5.00 : 1.00; \n \u2022 Created further flexibility to conduct sale leaseback transactions; \n \u2022 Increased swing-line loan capacity from $10 million to $25 million; and \n \u2022 Certain other operational and technical amendments.  Renegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and 8 months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value on the date of the reclassification, which approximated its carrying value. During the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified the liability from debt and capital lease obligations to accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every 5 years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and will amortize this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe following table outlines our consolidated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

include estimates of interest expense related to our credit facility assuming a 3.5% interest rate.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by CST, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nManagement Fees\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and excludes other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2016.\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 385 million gallons in 2017, reducing to 25 million gallons in 2021. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2022 through 2024 total 75 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nConcentration of Customers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed approximately 16% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 26% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 21% of our rent income from CST. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received 9% of our rent income from a lessee dealer that operates many of the sites acquired through the PMI and One Stop acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed approximately 17% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 36% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed 7% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 17% of our rent income from CST. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCrossAmerica Common Unit Offering\nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nOn September 21, 2015, CST announced that the independent executive committee of its board of directors approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during the year ended December 31, 2016. From inception until December 31, 2016, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements. The Merger Agreement precludes CST from making any further purchases of CrossAmerica common units.\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. The Merger Agreement precludes us from making any further repurchases of our common units. The following table shows the purchases made through December 31, 2016:\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Number of Units Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Price Paid per Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Cost of Units Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Remaining under the Program\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1 - December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,603,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,396,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1 - March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,752,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,644,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 1 - June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 1 - September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1 - December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,855,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not repurchase any common units under the plan subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nPurchase of CST Fuel Supply Equity Interests\nIn January 2015 and again in July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% and 12.5%, respectively, limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 4.8 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Notes 3 and 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Erickson\nIn February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPurchase of NTI retail sites\nIn July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of One Stop\nIn July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPurchase of Wholesale Fuel Supply Contracts from CST\nIn February 2016, CST sold 21 independent dealer contracts and 11 subwholesaler contracts to us for $2.9 million.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores\nOn March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of 31 Franchise Holiday Stores and 3 company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. Of the 34 company operated retail sites, 31 are located in Wisconsin and 3 are located in Minnesota. The acquisition was funded by borrowings under our credit facility.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContingencies\nLegal Matters\nSee Note 16 under the caption Litigation Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our legal matters.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nSee Note 22 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nOutlook\nThis outlook section does not take into account or give any effect to the impact of CST's proposed Merger on our business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-The pending Merger could adversely impact our business and strategic plans for growth.\u201d\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we expect our total motor fuel volume sold for 2017 to be higher than 2016 volumes. While the U.S. energy markets, including wholesale and retail motor fuel prices, are likely to continue to be volatile in the coming year, crude prices increased in the latter part of 2016 and have remained at those levels in early 2017, which supports the payment terms discount component of our motor fuel gross margin on an absolute basis while this price increase negatively impacts our retail motor fuel gross margin in our Retail Segment. We expect our rent income to increase in 2017 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, accretive to our unitholders, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nNew Accounting Policies\nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. Acquisitions of assets or entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs are accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 3 to the consolidated and statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value\u201d of goodwill. The determination of our implied fair value\u201d requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value\u201d of goodwill, which is compared to the corresponding carrying value. If the implied fair value\u201d is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, and considering valuation data of our reporting units as provided by a third party independent appraisal firm, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nWe base our estimates of such future costs on our prior experience with removal and include normal and customary costs we expect to incur associated with UST removal. We compare our cost estimates with our actual removal cost experience on an annual basis, and when the actual costs we experience exceed our original estimates, we will recognize an additional liability for estimated future costs to remove the USTs. Because these estimates are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs, the dollar amount of these obligations could change as more information is obtained.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $27.8 million and $23.5 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2016 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.4 million. See also Note 11 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $4.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2016 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million.\nSee also Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nTax Matters\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to CrossAmerica's taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. CrossAmerica is subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 CST's Merger Agreement-This section provides information on the pending Merger. \n \u2022 Significant Factors Affecting Our Profitability-This section describes the significant impact on our results of operations caused by crude oil commodity price volatility, seasonality and acquisition and financing activities. \n \u2022 Results of Operations-This section provides an analysis of our results of operations, including the results of operations of our business segments, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, an outlook for our business and non-GAAP financial measures. \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources-This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and cash flows. It also includes a discussion of our debt, capital requirements and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources. \n \u2022 New Accounting Policies-This section describes new accounting pronouncements that we have already adopted, those that we are required to adopt in the future, and those that became applicable in the current year as a result of new circumstances. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates-This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. \nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, Items 1., 1A. and 8. (which includes our consolidated financial statements) included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCST's Merger Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Circle K Stores Inc. will, through its acquisition of CST, control CST's interest in the General Partner and CST's 19.8% limited partner interest in us as well as all of the IDRs. The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States and Canada. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. See CST's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 11, 2016.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nThe Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nWholesale segment\nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 87% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increase and decrease corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2.2 million related to these payment discounts.\nRetail segment\nThe prices we pay for wholesale motor fuel are closely correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly and rapidly over short periods of time.\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices over the same period. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines rapidly.\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher terms discount as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\n \u2022 On February 5, 2016, we purchased independent dealer and subwholesaler contracts from CST for $2.9 million. See Notes 3 and 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores and company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On July 7, 2016, CST provided an $18.2 million refund payment to us related to our interest in CST Fuel Supply. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2016, we acquired the State Oil Assets located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 13, 2016, we amended our credit facility to provide additional flexibility to support achieving our growth strategy. See Note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2016, we sold the real property at 17 fee sites acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition for $25.0 million in proceeds, which were used to repay borrowings under the credit facility. We then leased these sites back under a triple net lease agreement. See Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In January 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 1.5 million common units. See Notes 3 and 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of 22 retail sites from Landmark, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In June 2015, we closed on the sale of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. In July 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units associated with the June offering. We used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility. See Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 12.5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 3.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Notes 3 and 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. \n \u2022 In March 2014, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement. The amended and restated credit facility is a senior secured revolving credit facility maturing March 4, 2019 with a total borrowing capacity of $550.0 million. \n \u2022 In April 2014, we acquired PMI for an aggregate purchase price of $73.5 million, including working capital, which resulted in the acquisition of 87 retail sites in Virginia and West Virginia. \n \u2022 In May 2014, we completed our acquisition of 52 wholesale supply contracts, one sub-wholesaler contract, five fee sites, six leasehold sites and certain other assets from affiliates of Atlas Oil Company for an aggregate purchase price of $39.2 million, including working capital. \n \u2022 In September 2014, we issued 4.1 million common units resulting in net proceeds of $135.0 million. We used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility. \n \u2022 On October 1, 2014, CST completed the GP Purchase and we entered into the Amended Omnibus Agreement. \n \u2022 In November 2014, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of Nice N Easy, we acquired the real property and underground storage tanks relating to 23 fee sites and the fuel distribution agreements with respect to 25 Nice N Easy retail sites for $53.8 million. \nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Income Statement Analysis\nBelow is an analysis of our consolidated statements of operations and provides the primary reasons for significant increases and decreases in the various income statement line items from period to period. Our consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nConsolidated Results\nOperating revenues declined $356.5 million, or 16%, while gross profit declined $13.9 million, or 8%.\nOperating revenues\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\n \u2022 A $268.2 million, or 14%, decline in our Wholesale segment revenues primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 A $254.2 million decline (95% of the total decline in Wholesale Segment operating revenues) attributable to a decrease in the wholesale price of our motor fuel. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 per barrel during 2015. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \n \u25e6 A $29.5 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of low margin wholesale fuel supply contracts and other assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting this decline was a $15.0 million increase primarily related to rental income associated with the acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \n \u2022 A $205.2 million, or 31%, decline in our Retail segment revenues primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 A decline of $44.6 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. \n \u25e6 A decrease of $124.0 million from a 24% decrease in motor fuel volumes sold related to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental volume generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \n \u25e6 A $36.6 million decline in our merchandise revenues attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental merchandise revenues generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition.  Intersegment revenues\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\n \u2022 Our intersegment revenues decreased $116.9 million, primarily attributable to the declines in price and volume discussed above.  Cost of sales\nCost of sales declined $342.6 million as a result of the decline in the wholesale price and gallons sold of motor fuel as noted above. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $12.1 million primarily attributable to the integration of prior year acquisitions and other cost savings initiatives, which reduced expenses by approximately $9.9 million. Additionally, equity-based compensation expense decreased $1.2 million as a result of less equity awards being granted in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $6.2 million primarily driven by our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million due to additional borrowings during 2015 and 2016 to fund acquisitions.\nIncome tax benefit\nWe recorded income tax benefits of $0.5 million and $3.5 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the loss generated by our corporate subsidiaries. In addition, we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million during 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Results\nOperating revenues declined $438.6 million, or 16%, while gross profit increased $44.6 million, or 36%.\nOperating revenues\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\n \u2022 A $443.7 million, or 19%, decline in our Wholesale segment primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 An $879.7 million decline attributable to a decrease in the wholesale price of our motor fuel. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased 48% to $48.66 per barrel for 2015, compared to $93.17 per barrel for 2014. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting this decline was a $423.7 million increase primarily related to an 18.4% increase in volume from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Other revenues increased $13.0 million driven by additional rental income from the Nice N Easy, Landmark and NTI acquisitions, as well as our company operated retail sites being converted to lessee dealer sites during 2015. \n \u2022 A $160.1 million, or 31%, increase in our Retail segment primarily attributable to: \n \u25e6 An increase of $242.5 million from a 55% increase in motor fuel volumes sold related to the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions. \n \u25e6 A $101.1 million increase in our merchandise revenues attributable to retail site operations from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. \n \u25e6 Partially offsetting these revenue increases was a decline of $183.5 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above, as well as converting company operated retail sites to independent dealer sites.  Intersegment revenues\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\n \u2022 Our intersegment revenues increased $155.0 million, primarily attributable to an increase in our Wholesale segment selling motor fuel to the retail sites acquired in the One Stop and the Erickson acquisitions, which are included in our Retail segment.  Cost of sales\nCost of sales declined $483.2 million, primarily from the decline in wholesale gasoline prices, which were partially offset by an increase in volumes purchased by our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $6.8 million decrease in stock based compensation related to the accelerated vesting as a result of the GP Purchase in 2014. This decrease was offset by higher costs associated with the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions in 2015.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions.\nGains on sales of assets, net\nGains on sales of assets, net, increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. The net gain recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the sale of individual sites and the divestiture of certain assets acquired in the PMI acquisition.\nIncome tax benefit\nThe income tax benefit increased from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit for both periods was due primarily to losses reported by LGWS.\nSegment Results\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistent with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nWholesale\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Wholesale segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of distribution sites and per gallon amounts):\n\n\n (a) Prior to 2016, we netted lease executory costs such as real estate taxes, maintenance, and utilities that we paid and re-billed to customers on our statement of operations. During the first quarter of 2016, we began accounting for such amounts as rent income and operating expenses and reflected this change in presentation retrospectively. This change resulted in a $10.8 million and $8.9 million increase in rent and other income and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n (b) Represents income from our equity interest in CST Fuel Supply. \n (c) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \n (d) In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we distributed motor fuel to 14 and 17 sub-wholesalers who distributed to additional sites. \n (e) The increase in the independent dealer site count was primarily attributable to 21 independent dealer contracts assigned to us by CST and 25 wholesale fuel supply contracts acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition, partially offset by a net 13 terminated motor fuel supply contracts that were not renewed. \n (f) The increase in the lessee dealer site count was primarily attributable to converting 77 company operated retail sites in our Retail segment to lessee dealers in our Wholesale segment in 2016 and the 49 sites acquired in the September 2016 State Oil Assets acquisition. \n (g) The decrease in the DMS site count was primarily due to sites converted to a third party lessee dealer or commission agent. Through the first five years of the lease with DMS, the lease agreement allows for a limited number of sites to be removed from the lease by each of DMS and us. This right generally expires October 31, 2017. \n (h) The increase in the commission agent site count was primarily attributable to 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in 2016. \n (i) The decrease in the company operated retail site count was primarily attributable to 77 company operated retail sites being converted to lessee dealer sites in 2016, partially offset by the 31 Franchised Holiday Stores. \n (j) Does not include the motor fuel gallons distributed to sub-wholesalers. The decrease in independent dealer gallons sold per day are due to the divestiture of commercial wholesale supply contracts associated with the PMI acquisition, whereby gallons distributed are reduced but the site count is not affected. \n (k) Includes the wholesale gross margin for motor fuel distributed to sub-wholesalers. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe results were driven by:\nMotor Fuel Gross profit\nThe $4.5 million decrease in motor fuel gross profit was due to a $3.6 million decline primarily from decreased payment discounts and incentives due to the decline in motor fuel prices as a result of the decrease in crude oil and the remaining decline was primarily due to a decline in motor fuel gallons sold due to the termination of commercial wholesale fuel supply contracts and disposing certain terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 during 2015. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\nRent and other gross profit\nRent and other margin increased $12.9 million primarily as a result of our acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition in September 2016, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity\nIncome from our investment in CST Fuel Supply increased $5.5 million as a result of the additional 12.5% equity interest we acquired in July 2015, partially offset by CST's sale of its California and Wyoming retail sites.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $0.1 million primarily from a $5.2 million cost savings associated with disposing of certain transportation and terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses driven by our acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe results were driven by:\nMotor Fuel Gross profit\n \u2022 The decrease in gross profit was due to a decline of $13.2 million in our motor fuel gross profit primarily attributable to a decline in our payment discounts and incentives, which are discussed under the heading The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\u201d partially offset by an $11.1 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in motor fuel volume.  Rent and other gross profit\n \u2022 Rent and other margin increased $11.4 million primarily from our acquisitions, including the acquisition and leaseback of NTIs with CST, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.  Income from CST Fuel Supply\n \u2022 We recorded $10.5 million of income from our investment in CST Fuel Supply, which we acquired in January (5%) and July (12.5%) of 2015.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $1.2 million primarily as a result of incremental operating expenses from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of certain PMI assets during 2015. \nRetail\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Retail segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of retail sites and per gallon amounts):\n\n (a) The inventory fair value adjustments represent the write-offs of the step-up in value ascribed to inventory acquired in the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition for 2016, the Erickson and One Stop acquisitions for 2015, and the PMI acquisition for 2014. \n (b) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. \n (c) The increase in the commission agent site count was primarily attributable to 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in 2016. \n (d) The decrease in retail sites relates to the conversion of 77 company operated retail sites to lessee dealer in 2016, partially offset by the 34 Franchised Holiday Stores acquired in 2016. \n (e) Includes the results from car wash sales and commissions from lottery, money orders, air/water/vacuum services and ATM fees. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGross profit declined $22.5 million, while operating expenses declined $11.0 million.\nThese results were impacted by:\nGross profit\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $10.9 million attributable to a 24% decrease in volume driven by the conversion of company operated retail sites acquired in prior acquisitions to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016 and a 42% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of crude oil prices being more volatile during the second half of 2015 than the second half of 2016 and the resulting impact on our motor fuel gross margin. The daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 35% during the last six months of 2015 compared to an increase of approximately 10% during the same period of 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \n \u2022 Our merchandise and services gross profit declined $11.6 million as a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of the change in product mix of our stores following our 2015 acquisitions and conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decline in operating expenses attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop and Franchised Holiday Stores acquisitions. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nGross profit increased $35.1 million, while operating expenses increased $23.3 million.\nThese results were driven by:\nGross profit\n \u2022 An $11.4 million increase in our motor fuel gross profit due to an increase in our cents per gallon gross profit associated with the lower wholesale cost of motor fuel and higher volumes associated with our acquisitions. \n \u2022 Our merchandise gross profit increased $24.1 million attributable to our acquisitions, while our merchandise gross profit percentage declined. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of our 2015 acquisitions. Additionally, we converted 52 company operated retail sites acquired in the PMI acquisition to lessee dealer sites during 2015, and these sites generally had a higher gross profit product mix.  Operating expenses\n \u2022 A $23.3 million increase in operating expenses attributable to our acquisitions. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio. EBITDA represents net income available to us before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unit-holders.\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\n\n (a) As approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board and the executive committee of CST and its board of directors, the Partnership and CST mutually agreed to settle certain amounts due under the terms of the Amended Omnibus Agreement in limited partnership units of the Partnership. \n (b) Relates to certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees, severance expenses and purchase accounting adjustments associated with recently acquired businesses. \n (c) Under the First Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of CrossAmerica, as amended, sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of sustaining capital expenditures are those made to maintain existing contract volumes, including payments to renew existing distribution contracts, or to maintain our sites in conditions suitable to lease, such as parking lot or roof replacement/renovation, or to replace equipment required to operate the existing business. \n (d) On January 26, 2017, the Board approved a quarterly distribution of $0.6125 per unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2016. The distribution is payable on February 13, 2017 to all unitholders of record on February 6, 2017. \n (e) The distribution coverage ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit. \n (f) Amount includes approximately 6,000 diluted units that are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per unit on the face of the income statement because to do so would be anti-dilutive. \nThe following table reconciles our segment Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA presented in the table above (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, service our debt and pay distributions to our unitholders and IDR distributions. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated by our operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuances of equity and debt securities. We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital, including sale-leaseback financing of real property with third parties, to support our liquidity requirements.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures, and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $3.2 million more in management fees in equity with CST in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $36.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $8.9 million in management fees in equity in 2015 whereas all management fees were paid in cash in 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, $94.2 million of cash was used in the Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions and $2.9 million for independent dealer and subwholesaler contracts purchased from CST. We also incurred $20.8 million of capital expenditures and received $17.5 million in proceeds from the refund payment related to CST's sale of the California and Wyoming assets. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nDuring 2015, $167.8 million of cash was used in the Landmark, Erickson and One Stop acquisitions and $141.9 million on the acquisitions of CST's NTIs and CST Fuel Supply equity interests. We also had $10.2 million in capital expenditures.\nDuring 2014, $163.6 million of cash was used in the PMI, Atlas and Nice N Easy acquisitions and $14.0 million in capital expenditures. We received $15.7 million in proceeds on our sales of the lubricant business acquired as part of the PMI acquisition and the wholesale fuel supply contracts to DMI.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2016, we paid $83.6 million in distributions and purchased $3.3 million in common units under our common unit purchase program. We received $25.0 million in proceeds on the sale-leaseback transaction and had $83.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions.\nDuring 2015, we received $144.9 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $158.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We paid $66.1 million in distributions and purchased $3.6 million in common units under our common unit purchase program.\nDuring 2014, we received $135.0 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $54.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We also paid $41.5 million in distributions.\nRefund payment related to CST sale of California and Wyoming assets\nOn July 7, 2016, as approved by the independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST, CST provided a refund payment to the purchase price paid by us for our interest in CST Fuel Supply. The total refund payment received by us was approximately $18.2 million. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nDistributions\nDistribution activity for 2016 was as follows:\n\nIDRs\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we distributed $3.4 million and $1.4 million to CST with respect to the IDRs.\nExpiration of the Subordination Period\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, on February 25, 2016, the first business day after the payment of the fourth quarter 2015 distribution of $0.5925 per unit, the subordination period under the Partnership Agreement ended. At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participate in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.53% as of December 31, 2016 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.25% as of December 31, 2016). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016 totaled $6.5 million. The credit facility is secured by\nsubstantially all of the assets of CrossAmerica and its subsidiaries. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 24, 2017, was $84.2 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least, in the aggregate, $20 million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.16 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn December 2016, the credit facility was amended as summarized below:\n \u2022 Modified certain terms to permit the acquisition of the Partnership's general partner indirectly by Couche-Tard; \n \u2022 Reduced the threshold for qualifying as a material acquisition\u201d from $50 million to $30 million; \n \u2022 Extended the time period from two to three quarters that the leverage ratio following a material acquisition can be 5.00 : 1.00; \n \u2022 Created further flexibility to conduct sale leaseback transactions; \n \u2022 Increased swing-line loan capacity from $10 million to $25 million; and \n \u2022 Certain other operational and technical amendments.  Renegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and 8 months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value on the date of the reclassification, which approximated its carrying value. During the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified the liability from debt and capital lease obligations to accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every 5 years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and will amortize this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe following table outlines our consolidated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are summarized below (in thousands):\n\nInterest Payments on Debt\nSuch amounts include estimates of interest expense related to our credit facility assuming a 3.5% interest rate.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by CST, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nManagement Fees\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and excludes other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2016.\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 385 million gallons in 2017, reducing to 25 million gallons in 2021. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2022 through 2024 total 75 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nConcentration of Customers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed approximately 16% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 26% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 21% of our rent income from CST. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received 9% of our rent income from a lessee dealer that operates many of the sites acquired through the PMI and One Stop acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed approximately 17% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and received 36% of our rent income from DMS and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed 7% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to CST and received 17% of our rent income from CST. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCrossAmerica Common Unit Offering\nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nOn September 21, 2015, CST announced that the independent executive committee of its board of directors approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during the year ended December 31, 2016. From inception until December 31, 2016, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements. The Merger Agreement precludes CST from making any further purchases of CrossAmerica common units.\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. The Merger Agreement precludes us from making any further repurchases of our common units. The following table shows the purchases made through December 31, 2016:\n\nWe did not repurchase any common units under the plan subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nPurchase of CST Fuel Supply Equity Interests\nIn January 2015 and again in July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% and 12.5%, respectively, limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 4.8 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Notes 3 and 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Erickson\nIn February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPurchase of NTI retail sites\nIn July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of One Stop\nIn July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nPurchase of Wholesale Fuel Supply Contracts from CST\nIn February 2016, CST sold 21 independent dealer contracts and 11 subwholesaler contracts to us for $2.9 million.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores\nOn March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of 31 Franchise Holiday Stores and 3 company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. Of the 34 company operated retail sites, 31 are located in Wisconsin and 3 are located in Minnesota. The acquisition was funded by borrowings under our credit facility.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital.\nSee Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContingencies\nLegal Matters\nSee Note 16 under the caption Litigation Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our legal matters.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nSee Note 22 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nOutlook\nThis outlook section does not take into account or give any effect to the impact of CST's proposed Merger on our business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-The pending Merger could adversely impact our business and strategic plans for growth.\u201d\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we expect our total motor fuel volume sold for 2017 to be higher than 2016 volumes. While the U.S. energy markets, including wholesale and retail motor fuel prices, are likely to continue to be volatile in the coming year, crude prices increased in the latter part of 2016 and have remained at those levels in early 2017, which supports the payment terms discount component of our motor fuel gross margin on an absolute basis while this price increase negatively impacts our retail motor fuel gross margin in our Retail Segment. We expect our rent income to increase in 2017 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, accretive to our unitholders, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nNew Accounting Policies\nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. Acquisitions of assets or entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs are accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 3 to the consolidated and statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIn the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value\u201d of goodwill. The determination of our implied fair value\u201d requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value\u201d of goodwill, which is compared to the corresponding carrying value. If the implied fair value\u201d is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, and considering valuation data of our reporting units as provided by a third party independent appraisal firm, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nWe base our estimates of such future costs on our prior experience with removal and include normal and customary costs we expect to incur associated with UST removal. We compare our cost estimates with our actual removal cost experience on an annual basis, and when the actual costs we experience exceed our original estimates, we will recognize an additional liability for estimated future costs to remove the USTs. Because these estimates are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs, the dollar amount of these obligations could change as more information is obtained.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $27.8 million and $23.5 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2016 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.4 million. See also Note 11 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $4.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2016 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million.\nSee also Note 14 under the caption Environmental Matters\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nTax Matters\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to CrossAmerica's taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. CrossAmerica is subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively.", "item_7_tables": "Table 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
