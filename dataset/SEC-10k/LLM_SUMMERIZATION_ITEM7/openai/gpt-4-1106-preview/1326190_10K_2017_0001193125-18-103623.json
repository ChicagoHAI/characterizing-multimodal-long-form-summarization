Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

The forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nOverview\nAltimmune, Inc. is a clinical stage immunotherapeutics company focused on the development of products to stimulate robust and durable immune responses for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen, each of which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates which potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an adenovector to achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September 2017. Initial data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect to move forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in early 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed to provide rapid, stable protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data the third quarter of 2018.\nWith the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (two years at room temperature and six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have shown it to be 100%\nprotective with a two-dose regiment (zero and 14 days) with higher toxin neutralizing antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine.\nFrom the Densigen platform, HepTcell, an immunotherapy for patients chronically infected with the HBV HepTcell is currently in a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients with chronic HBV. Preliminary results from this trial were inconclusive and the company is awaiting six-month follow up results which will be available in the third quarter of 2018, to determine whether to continue with further development of HepTcell, including any further clinical trials. Oncosyn, a cancer immunotherapeutic is in preclinical development.\nMerger with PharmAthene\nOur business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene and Private Altimmune. In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated January 18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Merger Sub Corp and Merger Sub LLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in the Mergers. Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine.\nOn May 4, 2017, Private Altimmune and PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i) Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as the surviving corporation; (ii) Private Altimmune then merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC (renamed as \u201cAltimmune LLC\u201d) remaining as the surviving entity; and (iii) PharmAthene was renamed as \u201cAltimmune, Inc.\u201d\nPrior to and as a condition for the Mergers, in January 2017, Private Altimmune entered into the Note Agreement for the private placement of the Notes for $8.6 million at 6% to be issued in two separate closings. The initial closing dated March 9, 2017 resulted in $3,150,630 of gross proceeds. The initial closing also included $196,496 of certain existing outstanding notes payable and $881,044 of certain accrued expenses that were modified and became a component of the Notes on February 28, 2017. The second closing contemplated by the Note Agreement was satisfied by the completion of the offering of redeemable preferred stock (\u201credeemable preferred stock\u201d) in August of 2017. In connection with the offering of the Notes, Private Altimmune issued warrants to purchase 49,776 shares of Private Altimmune common stock to certain noteholders, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, PharmAthene issued 0.749106 (the \u201cshare exchange ratio\u201d) of a share of PharmAthene common stock for each share of Private Altimmune common stock outstanding as of the closing date. All historical share and per share information - including common stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable preferred stock, common stock warrants, restricted stock, and stock options - has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the share exchange ratio. In addition, Private Altimmune stock options and warrants were also replaced with options and warrants to purchase PharmAthene's common stock at the same exchange ratio of 0.749106 share. Immediately prior to closing, 599,285 shares of our Series B convertible preferred (\u201cconvertible preferred\u201d) stock were converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a 1-for-1 basis. In addition, outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Notes were converted into 316,734 shares of Private Altimmune common stock. Further, 39,758 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued pursuant to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, and 660,715 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued as a result of warrant exercises, both in accordance with their original terms. Upon the closing of the Mergers, all outstanding shares of Private Altimmune common stock were exchanged for 6,883,498 shares of PharmAthene common stock.\nFollowing the closing, shareholders of Private Altimmune held 58.2% of the equity interest of the combined entity and assumed control of the combined entity. As a result, the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, and the assets and liabilities of PharmAthene will be recorded at their estimated fair value. The unadjusted purchase price to be allocated to PharmAthene's assets and liabilities was estimated to be\n$44,742,737 as of the closing date and consisted of the shares of the combined company retained by PharmAthene shareholders, and the estimated fair value of vested PharmAthene stock options and warrants which remained outstanding as of the closing date. Also at the closing, 7,569 shares of PharmAthene outstanding stock options with an estimated fair value of $15,173 remained subject to vesting and service requirements. These unvested options will be recorded as operating expense in future periods as the services are delivered and the options vest.\nExcept where the context indicates otherwise, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cAltimmune\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Mergers, to Private Altimmune and its subsidiaries, and for periods following the completion of the Mergers to the combined company and its subsidiaries.\n2017 Financing\nOn August 16, 2017, we issued 15,656 shares of $0.0001 par value, redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,345,427 shares of our common stock for total gross proceeds of $14,716,370, and incurred issuance costs totaling $1,697,800. The redeemable preferred stock matures on August 16, 2018. The maturity date may be extended at the option of the holders to ten trading days after the curing of a triggering event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or ten business days after the consummation of a change of control. In addition, the redeemable preferred agreements require that we reserve a sufficient number of common shares to cover at least 150% of the common shares expected to be issued upon the conversion of the redeemable preferred stock at the then current conversion price, and the exercises of common stock warrants issued in connection with the redeemable preferred stock. The redeemable preferred stock will be redeemed in nine specified installments. On each of the nine monthly specified installment dates beginning in December 2017 through maturity, we are required to convert, redeem, or a combination, one-ninth of the originally issued number of redeemable preferred share at their stated value of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate value of $1,739,524 for each installment. If we elect to convert the installment shares, the conversion price is determined based on the lowest of (i) the then applicable conversion price (initially $2.67 per share), (ii) 85% of the average of the three lowest weighted-average prices of the common stock during the ten trading days up to the installment date, and (iii) 85% of the weighted average price of common stock on the trading day immediately before the installment date. If we elect cash redemption, the redemption amount is $1,000 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and any accrued but unpaid late charges. As of December 31, 2017, there are 12,177 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding and we had issued an aggregate of 2,474,480 shares of common stock in connection with the redemption of 3,479 shares of redeemable preferred stock. As of March 30, 2018, there are 6,958 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding.\nCurrent Resources\nWe have incurred accumulated losses since inception. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, in addition to the Notes and the redeemable preferred stock issuance, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nAdequate financing opportunities might not be available to us, when and if needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms under such circumstances, our operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017, the\ncombination of the net proceeds from the Notes, cash assumed from the Mergers, the anticipated receipt of tax refunds, the August 2017 redeemable preferred stock financing, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts will be insufficient to fund our operations and research and development efforts into the first quarter of 2019.\nThe consolidated financial information presented below includes the accounts of Altimmune, Inc. Altimmune UK, PharmAthene UK and Altimmune France. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any product sales. Our revenues have been derived from license agreements and research grants that generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. We recognize revenue and related accounts receivable from license agreements when the related services are provided, and from research grants when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations, including the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for insurance and other supplies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, CROs and clinical sites.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when or to what extent we will generate sales from the commercialization of any of our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may never result in approved products. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>scope, rate of enrollment and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials, and other research and development activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>significant and potentially changing government regulation; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals, if any. </td> </tr>\n</table> A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of clinical and preclinical candidates. Our current planned research and development activities include the following:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Complete the ongoing Phase 2a trial of NasoVAX monovalent influenza vaccine in which interim data was released in March 2018.

We do not allocate personnel-related costs, costs associated with our general research platform improvements, depreciation or other indirect costs to specific programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs and professional fees for directors, accounting and legal services, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, investor relations costs and other costs associated with being a public company. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in staffing and related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgment and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nBusiness combination\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.\nOur in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) assets represent the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of substantive in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The valuation of IPR&D assets is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&D assets, the Company considers, among other factors, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and goodwill\nWe evaluate our long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including IPR&D assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value.\nOur IPR&D assets are currently non-amortizing. Until such time as the projects are either completed or abandoned, we test those assets for impairment at least annually at year end, or more frequently at interim periods, by evaluating qualitative factors which could be indicative of impairment. Qualitative factors being considered include, but are not limited to, the current project status, forecasted changes in the timing or amounts\nrequired to complete the project, forecasted changes in the future cash flows to be generated by the completed products, and changes to other market-based assumptions, such as discount rates. If impairment indicators are present as a result of our qualitative assessment, we test those assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying value. Upon completion or abandonment, the value of the IPR&D assets will be amortized to expense or the anticipated useful life of the developed products, if completed, or charged to expense when abandoned if no alternative future use exists. We performed qualitative assessments of our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, and have determined that our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, are not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill impairment using a one-step quantitative test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We consider multiple methods including both market and income approaches to determine fair value of our one reporting unit, and primarily rely on fair value estimated based on our market capitalization (a Level 2 input) as of or near the testing date, adjusted for an estimated control premium. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we have concluded that our goodwill was impaired and the full amount of its carrying value of $35,919,695 was written off as an impairment charge.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates of assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.\nTo the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may change for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified within levels in the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nResearch grants and contracts\nResearch grants are derived from government and foundation grants and contracts that support our efforts on specific research projects. We have determined that the government agencies and foundations providing grants and contracts to us are not our customers. These grants and contracts generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. Research grants and the related accounts receivable are recognized as earned when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete. Payments received in advance of services being provided are recorded as deferred revenue.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include payroll and personnel expense, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, raw materials, drug product manufacturing costs and allocated overhead including depreciation and amortization, rent and utilities. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized over the service period as the services are provided.\nStock based Compensation\nWe account for all stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation awarded to employees is measured at the grant date fair value of stock option grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation awarded to non-employees are subject to revaluation over their vesting terms. For performance-based awards where the vesting of the options may be accelerated upon the achievement of certain milestones, vesting and the related stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense when it is probable the milestone will be met. For awards containing a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in measuring the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures.\nWhen awards are modified, we compare the fair value of the affected award measured immediately prior to modification to its value after modification. To the extent that the fair value of the modified award exceeds the original award, the incremental fair value of the modified award is recognized as compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, and over the remaining vesting period for unvested awards. We estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of future tax benefits or liabilities on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. To date, we have not incurred interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Should such costs be incurred, they would be classified as a component of provision for income taxes. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. It also aligns lease accounting for lessors with the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to December 31, 2016\nTable 245:

</tr>\n</table> Increase in research grants and contracts is the combined results of our signing a five-year contract with BARDA in July 2016 which we amended in March 2017, and revenue from NIAID which we assumed from the Mergers with PharmAthene. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not include PharmAthene or the NIAID contract.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of expenses related to product candidate development.

The increased expense was due to an increase of $5.1 million for NasoShield in accordance with our BARDA contract, $3.4 million for NasoVAX to prepare for and start a Phase I clinical trial, $1.0 million of spending on SparVax-L acquired in the Mergers, $0.6 million for HepTcell to continue the Phase 2 clinical trials and $1.6 million in general overhead due to increased activity, offset by $0.5 million reduced spending on the Oncosyn product. In addition, research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not include PharmAthene or costs incurred under the NIAID contract.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> General and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 19%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase is due to an increase of $2.7 million in professional fees related to the Mergers and public company costs, $0.2 million in labor costs, $0.4 million in insurance costs and $0.5 million in stock compensation, offset by $2.4 million of offering costs incurred in 2016 that did not recur in\n2017. Increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 is less significant as compared to the changes in revenue and research and development expenses because we did not retain any general and administrative personnel from PharmAthene or its facilities.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> As a result of the continued declined in our common stock trading price, we had determined that our goodwill was impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the full carrying value of goodwill of $35.9 million was written off and recorded as impairment charges.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of imbedded derivative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(326 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,600 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Other expense increased by $24,000, or 480%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other comprehensive income (loss) - foreign currency translation adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,805 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign currency translation adjustment primarily related to the exchange rate differences in the carrying values of IPR&D and goodwill. We had elected to push down assets acquired and liabilities assumed to our U.K. subsidiary whose functional currency is the British pound. The exchange rate as of May 4, 2017, the date of the Mergers was \u00a31.00 = $1.2916. The exchange rate was \u00a31.00 = $1.2339 as of December 31, 2016 and \u00a31.00 = $1.3515 as of December 31, 2017. The translation adjustment gains of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the net effect of an increase in the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.0 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes, $13.7 million in cash assumed from the Mergers, and $13.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable preferred stock and warrants. Our primary source of cash during the comparable period in 2016 was $5.7 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $12.3 million at December 31, 2017. We believe, based on the operating cash requirements and capital expenditures expected for 2018, our cash on hand at December 31, 2017, expected tax refunds, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts, are insufficient to fund operations for a 12-month period from the date our consolidated financial statements are expected to be issued, and only provide cash into the first quarter of 2019. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. The current terms of our financing arrangements may make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date, and there is no assurance of any future revenues from product sales. Our sources of revenue consist of revenues under our contract with BARDA and NIAID for the development of NasalShield and SparVax-L, respectively, and to a lesser degree from other licensing arrangements. We have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had accumulated losses of $77.7 million since our inception. In addition, we have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We have had to rely on a variety of financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities. As capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nIn July 2016, we signed a five-year contract with BARDA which was amended in March 2017. The contract has a total value of up to $127.5 million and is used to fund clinical development of NasoShield. Under the contract, BARDA pays us a fixed fee and reimburses certain costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through cGMP manufacture and conduct of a Phase 2 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consists of an initial base performance period providing approximately $21.6 million in funding for the period July 2016 through July 2018. BARDA has seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical studies. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would provide additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million for the period July 2018 through July 2021. Through December 31, 2017, we have received an aggregate of approximately $6.5 million under the current BARDA contract.\nAs part of the Mergers, we assumed a PharmAthene contract with NIAID. The NIAID contract is incrementally funded. Over the base period of the contract, PharmAthene was awarded initial funding of approximately $5.2 million, which includes a cost reimbursement component and a fixed fee component payable\nupon achievement of certain milestones. NIAID exercised four options under this agreement to provide additional funding of approximately $8.8 million and an extension of the period of performance through December 31, 2017. In April 2017, PharmAthene was notified by NIAID that it will exercise only one of the additional remaining options under the contract to provide funding for a rabbit challenge study. Work under all exercised options will bring total committed and final funding under the NIAID contract to $15.1 million.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 3017, we had outstanding borrowings from a credit facility and two research and development funding arrangements as described in more detail below.\nCredit Facility\nWe have a secured line of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for borrowings up to $250,000 and matures in April 2018. The borrowings are secured by certain assets of the Company. Interest is payable monthly at the financial institution's prime rate (5.00% at December 31, 2017) plus 2.0% per annum with a floor of 5.0%. Accrued interest was $536 and $33 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $830 and $2,956, respectively.\nBPI France Notes\nAltimmune France has two non-interest-bearing research and development funding arrangements with BPI France that were entered into in December 2013 to provide Altimmune France up to \u0080750,000 ($899,890 at December 31, 2017) in research funding in the first arrangement and up to \u0080250,000 ($299,963 at December 31, 2017) in the second arrangement. Altimmune France is permitted to draw 50% of the funds upon the signing of the arrangements, an additional 30% contingent upon a financial audit and technical progress report, and the remaining amounts at the completion of the research and development project being funded by the arrangements. In October 2016, the Company and BPI agreed to extend the term on the arrangement by two years. Each of the two obligations is repayable in sixteen quarterly installments from June 2019 through March 2023. The total amount advanced under the arrangements was \u0080500,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 ($599,927 and $525,950 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively).\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,214 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,353 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,861 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(218 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(221 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,311 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included our net loss of $46.4 million, adjusted for $35.9 million in goodwill impairment charges, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $98,000 from the accretion of debt discount and deferred financing costs, a $98,000\nchanges in the fair value of warrant liability, a $1.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $2.6 million decrease in accounts payable, a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.4 million decrease in accrued expenses, a $3.4 million increase in tax refunds receivable, a $2.4 million decrease in deferred tax liability and $0.1 million from net changes in other balances.\nIn comparison, net cash used in operating activities of $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 included our net loss of $11.1 million, adjusted for $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense; write off of $2.6 million in deferred offering costs; a $0.1 million decrease in accounts receivable; an $0.9 million increase in accounts payable; a $0.6 million increase in accrued expenses; a $0.3 million increase in tax refund receivable, and $0.2 million from net changes in other balances.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities of $13.7 million was primarily the result of $13.7 million cash assumed from the Mergers with PharmAthene that closed in May 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of $3.0 million net proceeds received from the Notes that closed in March 2017 and $13.0 million net proceeds from the redeemable preferred financing in August 2017, offset by the repayment of notes payable for $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of $5.7 million net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible preferred stock in April 2016 offset by payments of deferred offering costs for $0.6 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen, each of which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates which potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an adenovector to achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September 2017. Initial data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect to move forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in early 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed to provide rapid, stable protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data the third quarter of 2018.\nWith the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (two years at room temperature and six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have shown it to be 100%\nprotective with a two-dose regiment (zero and 14 days) with higher toxin neutralizing antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine.\nFrom the Densigen platform, HepTcell, an immunotherapy for patients chronically infected with the HBV HepTcell is currently in a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients with chronic HBV. Preliminary results from this trial were inconclusive and the company is awaiting six-month follow up results which will be available in the third quarter of 2018, to determine whether to continue with further development of HepTcell, including any further clinical trials. Oncosyn, a cancer immunotherapeutic is in preclinical development.\nMerger with PharmAthene\nOur business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene and Private Altimmune. In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated January 18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Merger Sub Corp and Merger Sub LLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in the Mergers. Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine.\nOn May 4, 2017, Private Altimmune and PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i) Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as the surviving corporation; (ii) Private Altimmune then merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC (renamed as \u201cAltimmune LLC\u201d) remaining as the surviving entity; and (iii) PharmAthene was renamed as \u201cAltimmune, Inc.\u201d\nPrior to and as a condition for the Mergers, in January 2017, Private Altimmune entered into the Note Agreement for the private placement of the Notes for $8.6 million at 6% to be issued in two separate closings. The initial closing dated March 9, 2017 resulted in $3,150,630 of gross proceeds. The initial closing also included $196,496 of certain existing outstanding notes payable and $881,044 of certain accrued expenses that were modified and became a component of the Notes on February 28, 2017. The second closing contemplated by the Note Agreement was satisfied by the completion of the offering of redeemable preferred stock (\u201credeemable preferred stock\u201d) in August of 2017. In connection with the offering of the Notes, Private Altimmune issued warrants to purchase 49,776 shares of Private Altimmune common stock to certain noteholders, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, PharmAthene issued 0.749106 (the \u201cshare exchange ratio\u201d) of a share of PharmAthene common stock for each share of Private Altimmune common stock outstanding as of the closing date. All historical share and per share information - including common stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable preferred stock, common stock warrants, restricted stock, and stock options - has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the share exchange ratio. In addition, Private Altimmune stock options and warrants were also replaced with options and warrants to purchase PharmAthene's common stock at the same exchange ratio of 0.749106 share. Immediately prior to closing, 599,285 shares of our Series B convertible preferred (\u201cconvertible preferred\u201d) stock were converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a 1-for-1 basis. In addition, outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Notes were converted into 316,734 shares of Private Altimmune common stock. Further, 39,758 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued pursuant to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, and 660,715 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued as a result of warrant exercises, both in accordance with their original terms. Upon the closing of the Mergers, all outstanding shares of Private Altimmune common stock were exchanged for 6,883,498 shares of PharmAthene common stock.\nFollowing the closing, shareholders of Private Altimmune held 58.2% of the equity interest of the combined entity and assumed control of the combined entity. As a result, the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, and the assets and liabilities of PharmAthene will be recorded at their estimated fair value. The unadjusted purchase price to be allocated to PharmAthene's assets and liabilities was estimated to be\n$44,742,737 as of the closing date and consisted of the shares of the combined company retained by PharmAthene shareholders, and the estimated fair value of vested PharmAthene stock options and warrants which remained outstanding as of the closing date. Also at the closing, 7,569 shares of PharmAthene outstanding stock options with an estimated fair value of $15,173 remained subject to vesting and service requirements. These unvested options will be recorded as operating expense in future periods as the services are delivered and the options vest.\nExcept where the context indicates otherwise, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cAltimmune\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Mergers, to Private Altimmune and its subsidiaries, and for periods following the completion of the Mergers to the combined company and its subsidiaries.\n2017 Financing\nOn August 16, 2017, we issued 15,656 shares of $0.0001 par value, redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,345,427 shares of our common stock for total gross proceeds of $14,716,370, and incurred issuance costs totaling $1,697,800. The redeemable preferred stock matures on August 16, 2018. The maturity date may be extended at the option of the holders to ten trading days after the curing of a triggering event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or ten business days after the consummation of a change of control. In addition, the redeemable preferred agreements require that we reserve a sufficient number of common shares to cover at least 150% of the common shares expected to be issued upon the conversion of the redeemable preferred stock at the then current conversion price, and the exercises of common stock warrants issued in connection with the redeemable preferred stock. The redeemable preferred stock will be redeemed in nine specified installments. On each of the nine monthly specified installment dates beginning in December 2017 through maturity, we are required to convert, redeem, or a combination, one-ninth of the originally issued number of redeemable preferred share at their stated value of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate value of $1,739,524 for each installment. If we elect to convert the installment shares, the conversion price is determined based on the lowest of (i) the then applicable conversion price (initially $2.67 per share), (ii) 85% of the average of the three lowest weighted-average prices of the common stock during the ten trading days up to the installment date, and (iii) 85% of the weighted average price of common stock on the trading day immediately before the installment date. If we elect cash redemption, the redemption amount is $1,000 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and any accrued but unpaid late charges. As of December 31, 2017, there are 12,177 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding and we had issued an aggregate of 2,474,480 shares of common stock in connection with the redemption of 3,479 shares of redeemable preferred stock. As of March 30, 2018, there are 6,958 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding.\nCurrent Resources\nWe have incurred accumulated losses since inception. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, in addition to the Notes and the redeemable preferred stock issuance, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nAdequate financing opportunities might not be available to us, when and if needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms under such circumstances, our operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017, the\ncombination of the net proceeds from the Notes, cash assumed from the Mergers, the anticipated receipt of tax refunds, the August 2017 redeemable preferred stock financing, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts will be insufficient to fund our operations and research and development efforts into the first quarter of 2019.\nThe consolidated financial information presented below includes the accounts of Altimmune, Inc. Altimmune UK, PharmAthene UK and Altimmune France. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any product sales. Our revenues have been derived from license agreements and research grants that generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. We recognize revenue and related accounts receivable from license agreements when the related services are provided, and from research grants when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations, including the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for insurance and other supplies. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, CROs and clinical sites.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when or to what extent we will generate sales from the commercialization of any of our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may never result in approved products. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 scope, rate of enrollment and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials, and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 significant and potentially changing government regulation; and \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals, if any.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of clinical and preclinical candidates. Our current planned research and development activities include the following:\n \u2022 Complete the ongoing Phase 2a trial of NasoVAX monovalent influenza vaccine in which interim data was released in March 2018. Final data is anticipated in Q3 2018; \n \u2022 commence a Phase 2 dose ranging trial of a quadrivalent formulation of NasoVAX influenza vaccine in early 2019 and a dose confirmation trial to follow; \n \u2022 additional development of NasoVAX for the treatment of pandemic influenza, contingent on successful results in the treatment of seasonal influenza and non-dilutive funding from BARDA or other governmental agencies; \n \u2022 complete follow up and data analysis of our Phase 1b clinical trial for HepTcell for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, which began enrollment in July 2015, initial results were reported at the end of 2017 with additional unblinded results reported in the first quarter of 2018; final data is anticipated by the end of 2018; \n \u2022 complete enrollment of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for NasoShield anthrax vaccine and present initial data in mid-year 2018. Commence Phase 2 dose confirming trial for NasoShield anthrax vaccine in Q4 2018 (subject to continued funding and other support from BARDA) and; \n \u2022 manufacture clinical trial materials in support of our clinical trials.  To date, a significant portion of our research and development efforts have been related to the development of NasoVAX and HepTcell product candidates. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, costs associated with our general research platform improvements, depreciation or other indirect costs to specific programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs and professional fees for directors, accounting and legal services, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, investor relations costs and other costs associated with being a public company. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in staffing and related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgment and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nBusiness combination\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.\nOur in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) assets represent the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of substantive in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The valuation of IPR&D assets is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&D assets, the Company considers, among other factors, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and goodwill\nWe evaluate our long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including IPR&D assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value.\nOur IPR&D assets are currently non-amortizing. Until such time as the projects are either completed or abandoned, we test those assets for impairment at least annually at year end, or more frequently at interim periods, by evaluating qualitative factors which could be indicative of impairment. Qualitative factors being considered include, but are not limited to, the current project status, forecasted changes in the timing or amounts\nrequired to complete the project, forecasted changes in the future cash flows to be generated by the completed products, and changes to other market-based assumptions, such as discount rates. If impairment indicators are present as a result of our qualitative assessment, we test those assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying value. Upon completion or abandonment, the value of the IPR&D assets will be amortized to expense or the anticipated useful life of the developed products, if completed, or charged to expense when abandoned if no alternative future use exists. We performed qualitative assessments of our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, and have determined that our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, are not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill impairment using a one-step quantitative test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We consider multiple methods including both market and income approaches to determine fair value of our one reporting unit, and primarily rely on fair value estimated based on our market capitalization (a Level 2 input) as of or near the testing date, adjusted for an estimated control premium. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we have concluded that our goodwill was impaired and the full amount of its carrying value of $35,919,695 was written off as an impairment charge.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates of assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.\nTo the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may change for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified within levels in the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nResearch grants and contracts\nResearch grants are derived from government and foundation grants and contracts that support our efforts on specific research projects. We have determined that the government agencies and foundations providing grants and contracts to us are not our customers. These grants and contracts generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. Research grants and the related accounts receivable are recognized as earned when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete. Payments received in advance of services being provided are recorded as deferred revenue.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include payroll and personnel expense, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, raw materials, drug product manufacturing costs and allocated overhead including depreciation and amortization, rent and utilities. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized over the service period as the services are provided.\nStock based Compensation\nWe account for all stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation awarded to employees is measured at the grant date fair value of stock option grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation awarded to non-employees are subject to revaluation over their vesting terms. For performance-based awards where the vesting of the options may be accelerated upon the achievement of certain milestones, vesting and the related stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense when it is probable the milestone will be met. For awards containing a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in measuring the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures.\nWhen awards are modified, we compare the fair value of the affected award measured immediately prior to modification to its value after modification. To the extent that the fair value of the modified award exceeds the original award, the incremental fair value of the modified award is recognized as compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, and over the remaining vesting period for unvested awards. We estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of future tax benefits or liabilities on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. To date, we have not incurred interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Should such costs be incurred, they would be classified as a component of provision for income taxes. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. It also aligns lease accounting for lessors with the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to December 31, 2016\nTable 245:

Increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 is less significant as compared to the changes in revenue and research and development expenses because we did not retain any general and administrative personnel from PharmAthene or its facilities.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> As a result of the continued declined in our common stock trading price, we had determined that our goodwill was impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the full carrying value of goodwill of $35.9 million was written off and recorded as impairment charges.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of imbedded derivative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(326 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,600 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Other expense increased by $24,000, or 480%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million from the issuance of the Notes during 2017, offset by a $98,000 change in the fair value of warrant liability.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We recorded an income tax benefit of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflected estimated tax refunds we expect to receive from carrying back the 2017 NOLs to offset the 2016 federal and state income taxes paid by PharmAthene. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other comprehensive income (loss) - foreign currency translation adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,805 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign currency translation adjustment primarily related to the exchange rate differences in the carrying values of IPR&D and goodwill. We had elected to push down assets acquired and liabilities assumed to our U.K. subsidiary whose functional currency is the British pound. The exchange rate as of May 4, 2017, the date of the Mergers was \u00a31.00 = $1.2916. The exchange rate was \u00a31.00 = $1.2339 as of December 31, 2016 and \u00a31.00 = $1.3515 as of December 31, 2017. The translation adjustment gains of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the net effect of an increase in the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.0 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes, $13.7 million in cash assumed from the Mergers, and $13.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable preferred stock and warrants. Our primary source of cash during the comparable period in 2016 was $5.7 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $12.3 million at December 31, 2017. We believe, based on the operating cash requirements and capital expenditures expected for 2018, our cash on hand at December 31, 2017, expected tax refunds, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts, are insufficient to fund operations for a 12-month period from the date our consolidated financial statements are expected to be issued, and only provide cash into the first quarter of 2019. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. The current terms of our financing arrangements may make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date, and there is no assurance of any future revenues from product sales. Our sources of revenue consist of revenues under our contract with BARDA and NIAID for the development of NasalShield and SparVax-L, respectively, and to a lesser degree from other licensing arrangements. We have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had accumulated losses of $77.7 million since our inception. In addition, we have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We have had to rely on a variety of financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities. As capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nIn July 2016, we signed a five-year contract with BARDA which was amended in March 2017. The contract has a total value of up to $127.5 million and is used to fund clinical development of NasoShield. Under the contract, BARDA pays us a fixed fee and reimburses certain costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through cGMP manufacture and conduct of a Phase 2 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consists of an initial base performance period providing approximately $21.6 million in funding for the period July 2016 through July 2018. BARDA has seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical studies. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would provide additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million for the period July 2018 through July 2021. Through December 31, 2017, we have received an aggregate of approximately $6.5 million under the current BARDA contract.\nAs part of the Mergers, we assumed a PharmAthene contract with NIAID. The NIAID contract is incrementally funded. Over the base period of the contract, PharmAthene was awarded initial funding of approximately $5.2 million, which includes a cost reimbursement component and a fixed fee component payable\nupon achievement of certain milestones. NIAID exercised four options under this agreement to provide additional funding of approximately $8.8 million and an extension of the period of performance through December 31, 2017. In April 2017, PharmAthene was notified by NIAID that it will exercise only one of the additional remaining options under the contract to provide funding for a rabbit challenge study. Work under all exercised options will bring total committed and final funding under the NIAID contract to $15.1 million.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 3017, we had outstanding borrowings from a credit facility and two research and development funding arrangements as described in more detail below.\nCredit Facility\nWe have a secured line of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for borrowings up to $250,000 and matures in April 2018. The borrowings are secured by certain assets of the Company. Interest is payable monthly at the financial institution's prime rate (5.00% at December 31, 2017) plus 2.0% per annum with a floor of 5.0%. Accrued interest was $536 and $33 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $830 and $2,956, respectively.\nBPI France Notes\nAltimmune France has two non-interest-bearing research and development funding arrangements with BPI France that were entered into in December 2013 to provide Altimmune France up to \u0080750,000 ($899,890 at December 31, 2017) in research funding in the first arrangement and up to \u0080250,000 ($299,963 at December 31, 2017) in the second arrangement. Altimmune France is permitted to draw 50% of the funds upon the signing of the arrangements, an additional 30% contingent upon a financial audit and technical progress report, and the remaining amounts at the completion of the research and development project being funded by the arrangements. In October 2016, the Company and BPI agreed to extend the term on the arrangement by two years. Each of the two obligations is repayable in sixteen quarterly installments from June 2019 through March 2023. The total amount advanced under the arrangements was \u0080500,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 ($599,927 and $525,950 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively).\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,214 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,353 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,861 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(218 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(221 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,311 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included our net loss of $46.4 million, adjusted for $35.9 million in goodwill impairment charges, $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $98,000 from the accretion of debt discount and deferred financing costs, a $98,000\nchanges in the fair value of warrant liability, a $1.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $2.6 million decrease in accounts payable, a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.4 million decrease in accrued expenses, a $3.4 million increase in tax refunds receivable, a $2.4 million decrease in deferred tax liability and $0.1 million from net changes in other balances.\nIn comparison, net cash used in operating activities of $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 included our net loss of $11.1 million, adjusted for $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense; write off of $2.6 million in deferred offering costs; a $0.1 million decrease in accounts receivable; an $0.9 million increase in accounts payable; a $0.6 million increase in accrued expenses; a $0.3 million increase in tax refund receivable, and $0.2 million from net changes in other balances.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities of $13.7 million was primarily the result of $13.7 million cash assumed from the Mergers with PharmAthene that closed in May 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of $3.0 million net proceeds received from the Notes that closed in March 2017 and $13.0 million net proceeds from the redeemable preferred financing in August 2017, offset by the repayment of notes payable for $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of $5.7 million net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible preferred stock in April 2016 offset by payments of deferred offering costs for $0.6 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen, each of which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates which potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an adenovector to achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September 2017. Initial data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect to move forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in early 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed to provide rapid, stable protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data the third quarter of 2018.\nWith the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (two years at room temperature and six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have shown it to be 100%\nprotective with a two-dose regiment (zero and 14 days) with higher toxin neutralizing antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine.\nFrom the Densigen platform, HepTcell, an immunotherapy for patients chronically infected with the HBV HepTcell is currently in a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients with chronic HBV. Preliminary results from this trial were inconclusive and the company is awaiting six-month follow up results which will be available in the third quarter of 2018, to determine whether to continue with further development of HepTcell, including any further clinical trials. Oncosyn, a cancer immunotherapeutic is in preclinical development.\nMerger with PharmAthene\nOur business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene and Private Altimmune. In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated January 18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Merger Sub Corp and Merger Sub LLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in the Mergers. Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine.\nOn May 4, 2017, Private Altimmune and PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i) Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as the surviving corporation; (ii) Private Altimmune then merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC (renamed as \u201cAltimmune LLC\u201d) remaining as the surviving entity; and (iii) PharmAthene was renamed as \u201cAltimmune, Inc.\u201d\nPrior to and as a condition for the Mergers, in January 2017, Private Altimmune entered into the Note Agreement for the private placement of the Notes for $8.6 million at 6% to be issued in two separate closings. The initial closing dated March 9, 2017 resulted in $3,150,630 of gross proceeds. The initial closing also included $196,496 of certain existing outstanding notes payable and $881,044 of certain accrued expenses that were modified and became a component of the Notes on February 28, 2017. The second closing contemplated by the Note Agreement was satisfied by the completion of the offering of redeemable preferred stock (\u201credeemable preferred stock\u201d) in August of 2017. In connection with the offering of the Notes, Private Altimmune issued warrants to purchase 49,776 shares of Private Altimmune common stock to certain noteholders, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, PharmAthene issued 0.749106 (the \u201cshare exchange ratio\u201d) of a share of PharmAthene common stock for each share of Private Altimmune common stock outstanding as of the closing date. All historical share and per share information - including common stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable preferred stock, common stock warrants, restricted stock, and stock options - has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the share exchange ratio. In addition, Private Altimmune stock options and warrants were also replaced with options and warrants to purchase PharmAthene's common stock at the same exchange ratio of 0.749106 share. Immediately prior to closing, 599,285 shares of our Series B convertible preferred (\u201cconvertible preferred\u201d) stock were converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a 1-for-1 basis. In addition, outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Notes were converted into 316,734 shares of Private Altimmune common stock. Further, 39,758 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued pursuant to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, and 660,715 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued as a result of warrant exercises, both in accordance with their original terms. Upon the closing of the Mergers, all outstanding shares of Private Altimmune common stock were exchanged for 6,883,498 shares of PharmAthene common stock.\nFollowing the closing, shareholders of Private Altimmune held 58.2% of the equity interest of the combined entity and assumed control of the combined entity. As a result, the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, and the assets and liabilities of PharmAthene will be recorded at their estimated fair value. The unadjusted purchase price to be allocated to PharmAthene's assets and liabilities was estimated to be\n$44,742,737 as of the closing date and consisted of the shares of the combined company retained by PharmAthene shareholders, and the estimated fair value of vested PharmAthene stock options and warrants which remained outstanding as of the closing date. Also at the closing, 7,569 shares of PharmAthene outstanding stock options with an estimated fair value of $15,173 remained subject to vesting and service requirements. These unvested options will be recorded as operating expense in future periods as the services are delivered and the options vest.\nExcept where the context indicates otherwise, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cAltimmune\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Mergers, to Private Altimmune and its subsidiaries, and for periods following the completion of the Mergers to the combined company and its subsidiaries.\n2017 Financing\nOn August 16, 2017, we issued 15,656 shares of $0.0001 par value, redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,345,427 shares of our common stock for total gross proceeds of $14,716,370, and incurred issuance costs totaling $1,697,800. The redeemable preferred stock matures on August 16, 2018. The maturity date may be extended at the option of the holders to ten trading days after the curing of a triggering event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or ten business days after the consummation of a change of control. In addition, the redeemable preferred agreements require that we reserve a sufficient number of common shares to cover at least 150% of the common shares expected to be issued upon the conversion of the redeemable preferred stock at the then current conversion price, and the exercises of common stock warrants issued in connection with the redeemable preferred stock. The redeemable preferred stock will be redeemed in nine specified installments. On each of the nine monthly specified installment dates beginning in December 2017 through maturity, we are required to convert, redeem, or a combination, one-ninth of the originally issued number of redeemable preferred share at their stated value of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate value of $1,739,524 for each installment. If we elect to convert the installment shares, the conversion price is determined based on the lowest of (i) the then applicable conversion price (initially $2.67 per share), (ii) 85% of the average of the three lowest weighted-average prices of the common stock during the ten trading days up to the installment date, and (iii) 85% of the weighted average price of common stock on the trading day immediately before the installment date. If we elect cash redemption, the redemption amount is $1,000 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and any accrued but unpaid late charges. As of December 31, 2017, there are 12,177 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding and we had issued an aggregate of 2,474,480 shares of common stock in connection with the redemption of 3,479 shares of redeemable preferred stock. As of March 30, 2018, there are 6,958 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding.\nCurrent Resources\nWe have incurred accumulated losses since inception. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, in addition to the Notes and the redeemable preferred stock issuance, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nAdequate financing opportunities might not be available to us, when and if needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms under such circumstances, our operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017, the\ncombination of the net proceeds from the Notes, cash assumed from the Mergers, the anticipated receipt of tax refunds, the August 2017 redeemable preferred stock financing, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts will be insufficient to fund our operations and research and development efforts into the first quarter of 2019.\nThe consolidated financial information presented below includes the accounts of Altimmune, Inc. Altimmune UK, PharmAthene UK and Altimmune France. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any product sales. Our revenues have been derived from license agreements and research grants that generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. We recognize revenue and related accounts receivable from license agreements when the related services are provided, and from research grants when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations, including the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for insurance and other supplies. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, CROs and clinical sites.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when or to what extent we will generate sales from the commercialization of any of our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may never result in approved products. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 scope, rate of enrollment and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials, and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 significant and potentially changing government regulation; and \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals, if any.  A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of clinical and preclinical candidates. Our current planned research and development activities include the following:\n \u2022 Complete the ongoing Phase 2a trial of NasoVAX monovalent influenza vaccine in which interim data was released in March 2018. Final data is anticipated in Q3 2018; \n \u2022 commence a Phase 2 dose ranging trial of a quadrivalent formulation of NasoVAX influenza vaccine in early 2019 and a dose confirmation trial to follow; \n \u2022 additional development of NasoVAX for the treatment of pandemic influenza, contingent on successful results in the treatment of seasonal influenza and non-dilutive funding from BARDA or other governmental agencies; \n \u2022 complete follow up and data analysis of our Phase 1b clinical trial for HepTcell for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, which began enrollment in July 2015, initial results were reported at the end of 2017 with additional unblinded results reported in the first quarter of 2018; final data is anticipated by the end of 2018; \n \u2022 complete enrollment of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for NasoShield anthrax vaccine and present initial data in mid-year 2018. Commence Phase 2 dose confirming trial for NasoShield anthrax vaccine in Q4 2018 (subject to continued funding and other support from BARDA) and; \n \u2022 manufacture clinical trial materials in support of our clinical trials.  To date, a significant portion of our research and development efforts have been related to the development of NasoVAX and HepTcell product candidates. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, costs associated with our general research platform improvements, depreciation or other indirect costs to specific programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs and professional fees for directors, accounting and legal services, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, investor relations costs and other costs associated with being a public company. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in staffing and related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgment and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nBusiness combination\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.\nOur in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) assets represent the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of substantive in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The valuation of IPR&D assets is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&D assets, the Company considers, among other factors, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and goodwill\nWe evaluate our long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including IPR&D assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value.\nOur IPR&D assets are currently non-amortizing. Until such time as the projects are either completed or abandoned, we test those assets for impairment at least annually at year end, or more frequently at interim periods, by evaluating qualitative factors which could be indicative of impairment. Qualitative factors being considered include, but are not limited to, the current project status, forecasted changes in the timing or amounts\nrequired to complete the project, forecasted changes in the future cash flows to be generated by the completed products, and changes to other market-based assumptions, such as discount rates. If impairment indicators are present as a result of our qualitative assessment, we test those assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying value. Upon completion or abandonment, the value of the IPR&D assets will be amortized to expense or the anticipated useful life of the developed products, if completed, or charged to expense when abandoned if no alternative future use exists. We performed qualitative assessments of our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, and have determined that our long-lived assets, including IPR&D, are not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill impairment using a one-step quantitative test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We consider multiple methods including both market and income approaches to determine fair value of our one reporting unit, and primarily rely on fair value estimated based on our market capitalization (a Level 2 input) as of or near the testing date, adjusted for an estimated control premium. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we have concluded that our goodwill was impaired and the full amount of its carrying value of $35,919,695 was written off as an impairment charge.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates of assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.\nTo the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may change for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified within levels in the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nResearch grants and contracts\nResearch grants are derived from government and foundation grants and contracts that support our efforts on specific research projects. We have determined that the government agencies and foundations providing grants and contracts to us are not our customers. These grants and contracts generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs as those costs are incurred by the Company. Research grants and the related accounts receivable are recognized as earned when reimbursable expenses are incurred and the earnings process is complete. Payments received in advance of services being provided are recorded as deferred revenue.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include payroll and personnel expense, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, raw materials, drug product manufacturing costs and allocated overhead including depreciation and amortization, rent and utilities. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized over the service period as the services are provided.\nStock based Compensation\nWe account for all stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation awarded to employees is measured at the grant date fair value of stock option grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation awarded to non-employees are subject to revaluation over their vesting terms. For performance-based awards where the vesting of the options may be accelerated upon the achievement of certain milestones, vesting and the related stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense when it is probable the milestone will be met. For awards containing a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in measuring the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures.\nWhen awards are modified, we compare the fair value of the affected award measured immediately prior to modification to its value after modification. To the extent that the fair value of the modified award exceeds the original award, the incremental fair value of the modified award is recognized as compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, and over the remaining vesting period for unvested awards. We estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of future tax benefits or liabilities on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. To date, we have not incurred interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Should such costs be incurred, they would be classified as a component of provision for income taxes. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. It also aligns lease accounting for lessors with the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to December 31, 2016\n\nRevenue\nRevenue from grants and contracts for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of research grants from BARDA and NIAID in the United States for our anthrax vaccine product candidates.\n Increase in research grants and contracts is the combined results of our signing a five-year contract with BARDA in July 2016 which we amended in March 2017, and revenue from NIAID which we assumed from the Mergers with PharmAthene. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not include PharmAthene or the NIAID contract.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of expenses related to product candidate development. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\n Research and development expenses increased by $11.2 million, or 155%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increased expense was due to an increase of $5.1 million for NasoShield in accordance with our BARDA contract, $3.4 million for NasoVAX to prepare for and start a Phase I clinical trial, $1.0 million of spending on SparVax-L acquired in the Mergers, $0.6 million for HepTcell to continue the Phase 2 clinical trials and $1.6 million in general overhead due to increased activity, offset by $0.5 million reduced spending on the Oncosyn product. In addition, research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not include PharmAthene or costs incurred under the NIAID contract.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n General and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 19%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase is due to an increase of $2.7 million in professional fees related to the Mergers and public company costs, $0.2 million in labor costs, $0.4 million in insurance costs and $0.5 million in stock compensation, offset by $2.4 million of offering costs incurred in 2016 that did not recur in\n2017. Increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 is less significant as compared to the changes in revenue and research and development expenses because we did not retain any general and administrative personnel from PharmAthene or its facilities.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\n As a result of the continued declined in our common stock trading price, we had determined that our goodwill was impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the full carrying value of goodwill of $35.9 million was written off and recorded as impairment charges.\nOther Income (Expense)\n Other expense increased by $24,000, or 480%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million from the issuance of the Notes during 2017, offset by a $98,000 change in the fair value of warrant liability.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n We recorded an income tax benefit of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflected estimated tax refunds we expect to receive from carrying back the 2017 NOLs to offset the 2016 federal and state income taxes paid by PharmAthene. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene's tax return for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\n\nForeign currency translation adjustment primarily related to the exchange rate differences in the carrying values of IPR&D and goodwill. We had elected to push down assets acquired and liabilities assumed to our U.K. subsidiary whose functional currency is the British pound. The exchange rate as of May 4, 2017, the date of the Mergers was \u00a31.00 = $1.2916. The exchange rate was \u00a31.00 = $1.2339 as of December 31, 2016 and \u00a31.00 = $1.3515 as of December 31, 2017. The translation adjustment gains of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the net effect of an increase in the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.0 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes, $13.7 million in cash assumed from the Mergers, and $13.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable preferred stock and warrants. Our primary source of cash during the comparable period in 2016 was $5.7 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $12.3 million at December 31, 2017. We believe, based on the operating cash requirements and capital expenditures expected for 2018, our cash on hand at December 31, 2017, expected tax refunds, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts, are insufficient to fund operations for a 12-month period from the date our consolidated financial statements are expected to be issued, and only provide cash into the first quarter of 2019. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. The current terms of our financing arrangements may make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date, and there is no assurance of any future revenues from product sales. Our sources of revenue consist of revenues under our contract with BARDA and NIAID for the development of NasalShield and SparVax-L, respectively, and to a lesser degree from other licensing arrangements. We have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had accumulated losses of $77.7 million since our inception. In addition, we have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We have had to rely on a variety of financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities. As capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing.\nIn July 2016, we signed a five-year contract with BARDA which was amended in March 2017. The contract has a total value of up to $127.5 million and is used to fund clinical development of NasoShield. Under the contract, BARDA pays us a fixed fee and reimburses certain costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through cGMP manufacture and conduct of a Phase 2 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consists of an initial base performance period providing approximately $21.6 million in funding for the period July 2016 through July 2018. BARDA has seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical studies. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would provide additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million for the period July 2018 through July 2021. Through December 31, 2017, we have received an aggregate of approximately $6.5 million under the current BARDA contract.\nAs part of the Mergers, we assumed a PharmAthene contract with NIAID. The NIAID contract is incrementally funded. Over the base period of the contract, PharmAthene was awarded initial funding of approximately $5.2 million, which includes a cost reimbursement component and a fixed fee component payable\nupon achievement of certain milestones. NIAID exercised four options under this agreement to provide additional funding of approximately $8.8 million and an extension of the period of performance through December 31, 2017. In April 2017, PharmAthene was notified by NIAID that it will exercise only one of the additional remaining options under the contract to provide funding for a rabbit challenge study. Work under all exercised options will bring total committed and final funding under the NIAID contract to $15.1 million.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 3017, we had outstanding borrowings from a credit facility and two research and development funding arrangements as described in more detail below.\nCredit Facility\nWe have a secured line of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for borrowings up to $250,000 and matures in April 2018. The borrowings are secured by certain assets of the Company. Interest is payable monthly at the financial institution's prime rate (5.00% at December 31, 2017) plus 2.0% per annum with a floor of 5.0%. Accrued interest was $536 and $33 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $830 and $2,956, respectively.\nBPI France Notes\nAltimmune France has two non-interest-bearing research and development funding arrangements with BPI France that were entered into in December 2013 to provide Altimmune France up to \u0080750,000 ($899,890 at December 31, 2017) in research funding in the first arrangement and up to \u0080250,000 ($299,963 at December 31, 2017) in the second arrangement. Altimmune France is permitted to draw 50% of the funds upon the signing of the arrangements, an additional 30% contingent upon a financial audit and technical progress report, and the remaining amounts at the completion of the research and development project being funded by the arrangements. In October 2016, the Company and BPI agreed to extend the term on the arrangement by two years.

The Phase 2 program for NasoVAX began in September 2017, showing promising tolerance and effectiveness, with further development ongoing. Development of SparVax-L, an anthrax vaccine with improved shelf-life, has also shown progress with successful preclinical trials.\n\nThe company merged with PharmAthene in May 2017, and the combined entity continued under Altimmune, Inc. The merger involved complex financial arrangements including the issuance of notes, conversion of preferred stock, and the exchange of common stock.\n\nPost-merger, Altimmune conducted financing activities, raising funds through the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and warrants. The company's ongoing research efforts and trials have been funded partially by government contracts. They have not generated product sales revenue, and continue to operate at a loss, relying on additional equity or debt financing to maintain operations.\n\nThe report also outlines that Altimmune has incurred accumulated losses since inception and its future success may require further funding, which is not assured. The company's financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nUltimately, the report underscores the uncertainties surrounding Altimmune's operations, the reliance on forward-looking statements and projections in the report's content, and the inherent risks in the company's development-focus pursuits. The company plans to continue developing its clinical and preclinical candidates and securing necessary financing to support these efforts."}
