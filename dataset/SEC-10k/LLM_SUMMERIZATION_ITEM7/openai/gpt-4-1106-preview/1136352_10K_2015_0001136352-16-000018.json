Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States. Crestwood Equity owns a 99.9% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream and Crestwood Gas Services GP LLC (CGS GP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owns a 0.1% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream as of December 31, 2015. Crestwood Midstream's general partner, Crestwood Midstream GP LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, NGL and natural gas sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. We own or control:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>natural gas facilities with approximately 2.6 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 481 MMcf/d of processing capacity, 40.9 Bcf of certificated working gas storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transmission capacity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NGL facilities with approximately 24,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity and 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting more than 294,000 Bbls/d of NGLs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, approximately 1.5 million barrels of total storage capacity, 48,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity, and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On May 5, 2015, Crestwood Equity, Crestwood Midstream and certain of its affiliates entered into a definitive agreement under which CMLP agreed to merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity (the Simplification Merger). On September 30, 2015, CMLP's unitholders approved the Simplification Merger and we completed the merger on that date. As part of the merger consideration, CMLP's common and preferred unitholders (other than the Company and our subsidiaries) received 2.75 common or preferred units of the Company for each common or preferred unit of CMLP held upon completion of the merger. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Equity contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to Crestwood Midstream. Crestwood Operations' assets consist primarily of the assets utilized by our NGL supply and logistics business, including our West Coast NGL operations, our Seymour NGL storage facility and our fleet of NGL transportation and related rail-to-truck terminal assets. As a result of these transactions, Crestwood Equity is a holding company and all of our operating assets and investments are owned by or through Crestwood Midstream.\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our business segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing (G&P), which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics (formerly NGL and crude services operations), which includes our NGL supply and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet, and salt production business. Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT and PRBIC operations are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations. All of our operations are conducted by or through Crestwood Midstream. Below is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays across the United States and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in the near term while commodity prices remain depressed, (ii) capture greater upside economics when commodity prices normalize, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nOur G&P operations primarily include:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bakken Shale. We own and operate an integrated crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering system (the Arrow system) on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota. The Arrow system consists of 590 miles of low-pressure gathering pipeline capable of gathering 100 MMcf/d of natural gas, 125 MBbls/d of crude oil, and 40 MBbls/d of produced water. We also have approximately 266,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity at the Arrow central delivery point;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Marcellus Shale. We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison, Doddridge and Barbour Counties, West Virginia. These systems have a total gathering capacity of 875 MMcf/d and 138,080 horsepower of compression;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Barnett Shale. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 425 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Hood and Somervell Counties, Texas, which delivers the rich gas to our processing plant where NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream; and (ii) low-pressure gathering systems with a gathering capacity of 530 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Tarrant and Denton Counties, Texas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fayetteville Shale. We own and operate five low-pressure gas gathering systems with a gathering capacity of approximately 510 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Conway, Faulkner, Van Buren, and White Counties, Arkansas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delaware Permian. We own and operate low-pressure dry gas and rich natural gas systems with a primary focus on the Willow Lake system that includes a gathering and processing system with approximately 50 MMcf/d of capacity to serve our customers in Eddy County, New Mexico (Willow Lake system);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other 100% Owned and Operated Systems. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 36 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Roberts County, Texas, and a processing plant that extracts NGLs from the natural gas stream (Granite Wash system); and (ii) high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines with a gathering capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d that provide gathering and treating services to our customers located in Sabine Parish, Louisiana (Haynesville/Bossier system); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PRB Niobrara Shale. We own a 50% ownership interest in the Jackalope joint venture with Williams, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. The joint venture, operated by Williams, owns the Jackalope gas gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant. The Jackalope system is supported by a 20-year gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake under an area of dedication of approximately 388,000 gross acres in the core of the PRB Niobrara.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough the cash flows from our G&P operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with original terms ranging from 5-20 years, the results of our G&P operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. During 2015, two of our G&P customers, Quicksilver and Sabine filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In January 2016, Quicksilver executed an asset purchase agreement with a third party for the sale of its U.S. oil and gas assets. The sale is expected to close on March 31, 2016, pending certain closing conditions. On February 5, 2016, Quicksilver filed a motion to reject its gathering agreements with us. We filed an objection to this motion on February 26, 2016 and a hearing is scheduled in Delaware on March 4, 2016. We are in discussions with the third party regarding those agreements. We continue to provide services to Quicksilver, and the outcome of its restructuring process could have a material impact on our G&P segment's results of operations. Sabine continues to work with the bankruptcy court on its bankruptcy filing, and we continue to monitor their proceedings, and the outcome could impact our G&P segment's results of operations in the future.\nThe cash flows from our G&P operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality and weather fluctuations. We gather, process, treat, compress, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas pursuant to fixed-fee and, to a lesser extent, percent-of-proceeds contracts. We have historically taken title to the crude oil and natural gas volumes gathered under Arrow's fixed-fee contracts, and we remit netbacks to our producer customers based on the market prices at which we sell the crude oil and natural gas. On our other G&P systems, we do not take title to natural gas or NGLs under our fixed-fee contracts, whereas under our percent-of-proceeds contracts, we take title to the residue gas, NGLs and condensate and remit a portion of the sale proceeds to the producer based on prevailing commodity prices. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts minimizes our G&P segment's commodity price exposure and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur storage and transportation segment consists of our natural gas storage and transportation assets as follow:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Northeast Storage and Transportation. We have four natural gas storage facilities (Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Steuben and Seneca Lake) and three transportation pipelines (North/South Facilities, MARC I and the East Pipeline) located in the Northeast in or near the Marcellus Shale. Our storage facilities provide 40.9 Bcf of certificated firm storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity to producers, utilities, marketers and other customers. We believe the location of our storage and transportation assets in the Northeast relative to New York City and other premium demand markets along the East Coast helps to insulate our operations from production and commodity price changes that can more easily impact storage and transportation operators in other geographic regions, including Texas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>COLT Hub. We own and operate the COLT Hub, which is one of the largest crude oil rail terminals in the Bakken Shale based on actual throughput and which complements our Arrow acquisition. Located approximately 60 miles away from Arrow's central delivery point, the COLT Hub interconnects with the Arrow system through the Hiland and Tesoro pipeline systems. The hub, which can be sourced by numerous pipeline systems or truck, is capable of loading up to 160,000 Bbls/d and has approximately 1.2 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PRBIC. PRBIC, our 50% equity method investment, owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal, located in Douglas County, Wyoming, which provides a market for crude oil production from the PRB Niobrara. The joint venture, operated by Twin Eagle, sources crude oil production from Chesapeake and other PRB Niobrara producers. PRBIC includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity. Additionally, in anticipation of growing PRB Niobrara crude oil volumes, PRBIC expanded its pipeline terminal to include connections to Kinder Morgan's HH Pipeline system in July 2015 and initiated a pipeline project to interconnect with Plains All American Pipeline's Rocky Mountain Pipeline system, which is expected to be completed in March 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tres Holdings. We own a 50.01% ownership interest in Tres Holdings LLC (Tres Holdings), a joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and an affiliate of Brookfield, which owns the remaining 49.99% interest in Tres Holdings. Tres Holdings owns Tres Palacios, which owns a FERC-certificated 38.4 Bcf multi-cycle, salt dome natural gas storage facility. Its 63-mile, dual 24-inch diameter header system (including a 52-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 11-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 10 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan Inc.'s Houston central processing plant. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% membership interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings. As a result of the sale, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated Tres Palacios' operations. We account for the investment in Tres Holdings under the equity method of accounting. Brookfield and Tres Palacios entered into a five-year, fixed fee contract under which Tres Palacios will make 15 Bcf of firm storage capacity and 150,000 Dth/d of enhanced interruptible services available to Brookfield.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cash flows from our storage and transportation operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with an original term ranging from 1-10 years. Our cash flows from interruptible and other hub services tends to increase during the peak winter season. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are largely supported by take-or-pay contracts with refiners and, to a lesser extent, marketer customers and are not significantly affected in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality or weather fluctuations. We are working to renew long-term storage and loading contracts associated with our COLT Hub operations. Several of these contracts expire in 2016 and we expect to extend the contract terms for several of our existing customers. We are also pursuing multiple pipeline and storage projects at the COLT terminal supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment consists of our NGL supply and logistics business and US Salt. We utilize our over-the-road and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics operations primarily include:\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NGL Supply and Logistics Business. Our NGL supply and logistics business serves producers, refiners and other customers that produce or consume natural gas liquids, including primarily propane, butane and natural gasoline. To provide these services, we utilize our portfolio of proprietary and third party NGL processing, fractionation, storage, terminal and trucking assets including our fleet of rail and rolling stock, rail-to-truck terminals, West Coast processing, fractionation and storage operations, NGL storage facilities, and contracted capacity (including leased storage capacity at major hubs and leased transportation capacity on major NGL pipelines);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Crude Oil and Produced Water Trucking. Our crude oil and produced water trucking fleet has 48,000 Bbls/d of crude oil and produced water transportation capacity. These assets were acquired in the first half of 2014. We provide hauling services to customers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Texas and New Mexico; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>US Salt. Our salt production business, which has a plant near Watkins Glen, New York, is capable of producing more than 400,000 tons of evaporated salt products annually. US Salt's solution mining process creates underground caverns that can be developed into natural gas and NGL storage capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cash flows from our marketing, supply and logistics business represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods. The cash flows from our salt operations represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts that are less than one year in duration, and are relatively stable and not subject to seasonal or cyclical variation due to the use of, and demand for, salt products in everyday life.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our stakeholders by maximizing throughput on our assets, expanding our services and exercising prudent control of operating and administrative costs, resulting in stable operating margins and improving cash flows from operations. Our business strategy further depends on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees and develop growth projects that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have positioned the Company to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment. Many of our assets are located on long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays which are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of midstream infrastructure to flow production to market and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. We believe the diversity of our asset portfolio, wide range of services provided and extensive customer portfolio, taken together, provides us with a positive forward view of our ability to be successful in the current market which has been impacted by prolonged low commodity prices. In addition, a substantial portion of the midstream services we provide to customers in the shale plays are based on fixed fee, take-or-pay or cost-of-service agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. We are actively working with our customers to further improve the profitability of their operations through the services we offer, and in certain instances, by adjusting our rate, service and/or volume commitment structures to incentivize them to utilize our services in the short-term while preserving long-term flexibility in a challenging market. In particular, we are in active discussions with a number of our customers regarding amendments and/or extensions of their contracts, and these discussions will continue into 2016.\nIn 2016, we are evaluating strategic actions to substantially de-risk the investment profile of Crestwood and position the Company to emerge from this challenging market environment as a stronger, better capitalized company. These are designed to address our near-term cost of capital limitations and position the Company for long-term value creation for all stakeholders when the market improves and include reducing capital expenditures, further reducing costs, divesting of assets, evaluating distributions and strengthening the balance sheet including repayment of indebtedness.\nDuring 2015, we completed a number of cost-reduction efforts, including the Simplification Merger, and we decreased our on-going expenses related to operations, maintenance and general and administrative matters by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, excluding $29.4 million of upfront costs related to this cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. We continue to pursue additional opportunities to further reduce costs in 2016, which we believe will result in lower expenses in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be limited to previously committed contractual projects around our existing asset footprint of approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2016.\nBased on current operations, we expect financial results in 2016 that are relatively consistent with our 2015 results, despite continued anticipated depressed commodity prices. Through the execution of strategic efforts described above, we expect to reposition the Company for increasing stability and strength through a continued challenging market environment, which will over the long-term, best position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany activities within the energy midstream sector have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years, and we expect the trend of regulatory oversight to continue for the foreseeable future. We anticipate greater regulatory oversight related to activities that have attracted significant negative attention in the public domain (e.g., transportation of crude oil by rail). We also anticipate greater regulatory oversight in states like North Dakota and tribal sovereignties like the MHA Nation, where regulation in certain areas is now starting to align with the tremendous production growth experienced in those jurisdictions in a short period of time.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (net interest and debt expense and loss on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates for our proportionate share of their depreciation and interest. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, gains and losses on acquisition-related contingencies, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, certain costs related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory that these derivatives relate to. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nIn conjunction with the closing of the Simplification Merger on September 30, 2015, CEQP contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to CMLP, and as a result of this equity contribution, CMLP controls the operating and financial decisions of Crestwood Operations. CMLP accounted for this transaction as a reorganization of entities under common control and the accounting standards related to such transactions requires CMLP to retroactively adjust its historical results to reflect the operations of Crestwood Operations as being acquired on June 19, 2013, the date in which CMLP and Crestwood Operations came under common control. The contribution of Crestwood Operations to CMLP had no impact on CEQP's results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, primarily includes costs incurred related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the Simplification Merger, the Crestwood Merger and the Arrow Acquisition.\nSegment Results\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing operations; (ii) storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics operations (formerly NGL and crude services operations). Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT operations and PRBIC investment are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations.\nThe following tables summarize the EBITDA of our segments (in millions):\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>

years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGathering and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $250.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments of approximately $265.5 million recorded during 2015 related to our Fayetteville, Granite Wash and Haynesville operations, compared to $51.7 million of impairments during the year ended December 31, 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to CMLP's EBITDA decrease was a $769.1 million decrease in revenues, offset by a $756.0 million decrease in costs of products/services sold and a $13.8 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense. The revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $742.9 million partially offset by a decrease in its costs of product/services sold of $738.4 million. The decrease in product revenues and costs of product/services sold was driven by the decreases in market prices on crude oil, which caused average crude oil prices on our crude oil sales to decrease by approximately 50% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced a $21.7 million increase in Arrow's service revenues due to an increase of 14%, 30% and 49% in its crude oil, natural gas and water volumes, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, as new wells were connected to the system.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a decrease in our G&P segment's operations and maintenance expense of approximately $13.8 million compared to 2014 resulting from cost-reduction efforts undertaken in 2015, which is further described in Outlook and Trends above.\nCMLP's G&P segment EBITDA was also impacted by an $8.6 million loss on contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss on contingent consideration that reflected the fair value of an earn-out premium associated with the original acquisition of our Marcellus G&P assets from Antero Resources Appalachian Corporation (Antero) in 2012. The earn-out provision, which was settled in February 2015, allowed Antero to receive an additional $40.0 million payment when gathering volumes exceeded a certain threshold as defined in the acquisition agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million impairment of our Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope) equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from Jackalope increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to Jackalope placing its Bucking Horse processing plant in service in January 2015.\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $1,100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition to the impairments described above, CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA was impacted by $850.5 million of property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments related to our Barnett operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA increased by approximately $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of operations from our Arrow assets compared to two months in 2013. Arrow contributed EBITDA of approximately $55.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nRevenues increased by approximately $1,706.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. Arrow contributed revenues of approximately $1,884.3 million and $218.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The remaining revenue increase was primarily driven by higher gathering and compression volumes during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. We gathered approximately 1.2 Bcf/d of natural gas on our G&P systems during 2014 compared to 1.0 Bcf/d during 2013. Our compression volumes increased from 0.3 Bcf/d during 2013 to 0.5 Bcf/d in 2014. The increases in our G&P gathering and compression volumes\nwere primarily due to several new compressor stations placed in service during 2013 and 2014 in the Marcellus Shale and new wells connected to our systems during 2014.\nPartially offsetting the increases described above were higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 of approximately $1,592.4 million and $44.1 million primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. The remaining increase in our costs of product/services sold was primarily due to higher volumes gathered on our New Mexico gathering systems under a gathering and processing agreement we entered into with Trinity River Energy in April 2014 and increased production at Granite Wash due to new wells connected during 2014.\nIn addition to the higher costs discussed above, CEQP's G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million and $31.4 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as described above.\nWe recorded impairments of $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our Granite Wash and Fayetteville operations compared to $4.1 million of impairments recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to our Haynesville operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $631.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $623.4 million goodwill impairment recorded related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of this goodwill impairment, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA were higher operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the expansion of the COLT Hub facility (including the release and departure tracks placed in service in December 2014) and other expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, primarily the NS-1 Expansion project.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA described above were higher revenues of approximately $15.5 million and lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $2.7 million. The increase in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of our expansion of the facility discussed above and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system, which resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we loaded approximately 117 MBbls/d of crude on rail cars entering the facility compared to 110 MBbls/d in 2014. Also contributing to the revenue increase was additional firm transportation services resulting from expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015 which increased volumes delivered into Millennium Pipeline. Partially offsetting these revenue increases, was a reduction in firm storage revenues due to recontracting efforts yielding rates which were lower in 2015 compared to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged 1.5 Bcf/d in both years.\nAlso impacting CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was a $23.4 million impairment of our PRBIC equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from our PRBIC investment increased by $4.9 million.\nIn December 2014, Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield formed the Tres Holdings joint venture and during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded equity earnings of approximately $2.5 million and $0.2 million from Tres Holdings.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $663.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition, in December 2014, CEQP sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to the newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million (of which approximately $66.4 million was paid by Crestwood Midstream), and as a result, CEQP deconsolidated Tres Palacios. Tres Palacios generated approximately $0.4 million of EBITDA to CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA prior to its deconsolidation on December 1, 2014. CEQP recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the portion of the sale related to Brookfield. For a further discussion of our investment in Tres Holdings, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur storage and transportation segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our storage and transportation segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $138.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was due to our 2014 results having a full year of operating results compared to only six months in 2013. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the sale of our Tres Palacios membership interest as discussed above.\nWe experienced an increase in demand for our storage and transportation services as evidenced by higher usage on our firm storage and transportation contracts and increased volumes from interruptible services, resulting from increased producer activity and increased locational basis spreads in the Northeast, which was the primary driver for the increase in revenues of approximately $88.7 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf/d compared to 1.4 Bcf/d during 2013. The remaining increase in revenues of approximately $45.0 million was due primarily to having a full year of operations from our COLT Hub assets in 2014 compared to six months in 2013. In addition, we experienced higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of the expansion of the facility and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system. During 2014 and 2013, we loaded approximately 110 MBbls/d and 82 MBbls/d of crude oil on rail cars entering the facility.\nPartially offsetting the increases in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's revenues were higher costs of product/services sold primarily related to higher throughput volumes at our North-South and MARC I facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense due to having a full year of storage and transportation operations in 2014 compared to six months in 2013.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $469.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to impairments of property, plant and equipment and goodwill of approximately $484.4 million related to our West Coast, Watkins Glen, supply and logistics, storage and terminals and trucking operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $31.6 million related to Watkins Glen and US Salt operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA was a year over year decrease in revenues of approximately $531.1 million, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $512.6 million. These revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, and include approximately $18.9 million and $51.2 million of gains on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations decreased by $541.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared 2014, compared to a decrease of $527.2 million in its costs of product/services sold year over year. These decreases were driven by decreased demand for propane and butane at our NGL terminals and other facilities resulting from lower commodity prices, and the fact that we experienced a milder winter during early 2015 compared to the unusually cold winter during 2014, which reduced our opportunities to capture incremental demand and margin opportunities in these operations.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nEBITDA for CEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $468.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our NGL and crude services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA increased by approximately $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher revenues of $664.1 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense of $597.0 million. Our costs of product/services sold included $51.2 million of gains and $11.2 million of losses on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we recorded $31.6 million of impairments of our Watkins Glen and US Salt reporting units in 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nOur NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations produced CEQP EBITDA of $75.6 million and $25.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase was due primarily to our 2014 results having a full year of operating compared to six months in 2013.\nOther EBITDA Results\nAs discussed in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule, Note 17, our corporate operations include all general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to our reporting segments, however such expenses impact our consolidated EBITDA.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CEQP incurred costs of $32.4 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CEQP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. CEQP's general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of expenses related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition, partially offset by approximately $40.6 million of transaction costs incurred in 2013 primarily related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CMLP incurred costs of $23.9 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CMLP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense - During the year ended December 31, 2015, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased compared to 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the assets acquired during 2014 and the Crestwood Merger in June 2013. For a further discussion of our acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nInterest and Debt Expense - Interest and debt expense, net increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013, primarily due to (i) the issuance of $700 million of 6.25% senior notes in March 2015; (ii) higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities; (iii) the assumption of $1.1 billion of long-term debt due to the Crestwood Merger in June 2013; and (iv) the issuance of $600 million of 6.125% senior notes in November 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were repayments of CEQP's credit facility in conjunction with the Simplification Merger, the redemption of Crestwood Midstream's 2019 Senior Notes and repayments of Crestwood Midstream's $1.0 billion credit facility.\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense (in millions):\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CEQP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CMLP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>108.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt-related costs\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest and debt expense\n</td> <td>142.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: capitalized interest\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and debt expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, credit facilities, debt issuances, and sales of common and preferred units. Our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements based on our successful execution of our strategy detailed in Outlook and Trends above.\nContemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Midstream amended and restated its senior secured credit agreement to provide for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the CMLP Credit Facility), which expires in September 2020. On September 30, 2015, Crestwood Midstream borrowed approximately $720 million under the CMLP Credit Facility to (i) repay all borrowings outstanding under its $1.0 billion credit facility, (ii) fund a distribution to CEQP of approximately $378.3 million for purposes of repaying (or, if applicable, satisfying and discharging) substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and (iii) pay merger-related fees and expenses. As of December 31, 2015, Crestwood Midstream had $399.0 million of available capacity under its credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in its credit agreement. Crestwood Midstream also has approximately $1.8 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015, with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2023. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 8 for a more detailed discussion of the CMLP Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all our debt covenants related to the CMLP credit facility and CMLP senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the CMLP Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe our current liquidity sources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our future operating and capital requirements.\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(212.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(483.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,042.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(236.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>859.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows increased approximately $157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $169.7 million net cash inflow from working capital resulting primarily from lesser working capital requirements of our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, primarily due to lower commodity prices. In addition, we experienced a $1,298.5 million decrease in operating revenues primarily from our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $1,281.1 million primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices on our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 our operating cash flows increased approximately $94.7 million compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to the Crestwood Merger and the acquisition of our Arrow operations which occurred in June 2013 and November 2013, respectively. These acquisitions contributed higher operating revenues of $2,504.6 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold, operations and maintenance expense and general and administrative expense of approximately $2,268.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, our interest paid increased approximately $49.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities.\nInvesting Activities\nThe energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions). We have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flow and earnings.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>182.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(73.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents gross purchases of property, plant and equipment that are reimbursable by third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the capital expenditures described in the table above, our cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the following significant items during the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nAcquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid approximately $19.5 million and $555.6 million to acquire our transportation fleet from Red Rock and LT Enterprises in 2014 and our Arrow assets in 2013. For a further discussion of these acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment. Our purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by approximately $77 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to organic growth projects placed in service related to our Marcellus assets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired a 50% interest in Jackalope and a 50.01% interest in PRBIC for approximately $107.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we contributed approximately $42.0 million, $108.6 million and $21.5 million to our\nequity investments. For a further discussion of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nProceeds from the Sale of Tres Palacios. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings, a newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream's consolidated subsidiary and an affiliate of Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million. As a result of this transaction, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated the operations of Tres Palacios. Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield paid approximately $66.4 million each to acquire their respective interests in Tres Palacios. For a further discussion of our sale in Tres Palacios, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nFinancing Activities\nSignificant items impacting our financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included the following:\nEquity Transactions\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in distributions to partners of approximately $69.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $34.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in the number of limited partner units outstanding;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease in distributions to non-controlling partners of approximately $62.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the Simplification Merger and a $92.0 million increase in distributions to non-controlling partners in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the Crestwood Merger;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$58.8 million and $430.5 million net proceeds from the issuance of Crestwood Midstream's Class A Preferred Units in 2015 and 2014, respectively, prior to the completion of the Simplification Merger.

Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future\ngrowth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCommodity prices have continued to decline since late 2014, and that decline has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2015 and 2014. The following table summarizes the goodwill of our various reporting units (in millions):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering and Processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Fayetteville\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marcellus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arrow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Northeast Storage and Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COLT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Coast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US Salt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watkins Glen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Crestwood Midstream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,234.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,149.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barnett (Gathering and Processing)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Crestwood Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,491.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe goodwill impairments recorded during 2015 primarily resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the reporting units considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our customers. We utilized discount rates ranging from 10% to 16% to determine the fair value of our reporting units as of December 31, 2015.\nWe continue to monitor the remaining goodwill described in the table above, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. In particular, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses that recorded goodwill impairments in 2015 could have resulted in an additional $45 million and $55 million of goodwill impairments as of December 31, 2015, respectively. For more information about the market for our common equity, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nIn addition, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rate utilized to determine the fair value of our Northeast Storage and Transportation business could result in the fair value of that business falling below the carrying value of the business, which could result in a goodwill impairment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in that reporting unit. During 2015 and 2014, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2015 and 2014, we incurred $8.5 million and $33.2 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Granite Wash gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our major customer of those assets has declared bankruptcy and has ceased any substantial drilling in the Granite Wash in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas and NGLs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2015, we incurred $593.3 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Barnett gathering and processing operations, which resulted from the recent actions of our primary customer in the Barnett Shale, Quicksilver, related to its filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2015, we incurred $185.5 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Fayetteville and Haynesville gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our customers for those assets have ceased any substantial drilling in the Fayetteville and Haynesville Shales in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2015, we incurred $31.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment related to our Watkins Glen marketing, supply and logistics segment development project, which resulted from continued delays and uncertainties in the permitting of our proposed NGL storage facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur other operations that incurred goodwill impairments during 2015 did not incur significant impairments on their long-lived assets based on our assessment that the undiscounted cash flows related to those assets exceeded their carrying value at December 31, 2015.\nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity-Method Investments\nWe acquired our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments in 2013, which required us to record the respective investments at fair value on the date they were acquired. We evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity-method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity-method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity-method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity-method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity-method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nBecause our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments were acquired in 2013, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these investments or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those investments from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the equity-method investment falling below their carrying value, and could result in an assessment of whether that investment is impaired.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million and $23.4 million impairment of our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments, respectively, as a result of decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rate utilized in determining the fair value of the equity-method investment considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our equity-method investments' customers.\nWe continue to monitor our equity-method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity-method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe gather, treat, compress, process, store, transport and sell various commodities pursuant to fixed-fee and percent-of-proceeds contracts. We recognize revenue on these contracts when certain criteria are met, the most important of which is that the delivery of the service has been performed. Certain of our contracts in our gathering and processing segment and storage and transportation segment contain minimum volume features under which the customers must deliver a set quantity of crude or gas or pay a deficiency fee based on the amount the customers' actual volume is short of the contractual minimum volume. The\nminimum volume feature generally allows customers a recoupment period in subsequent periods to make up certain previous volumetric shortfalls by delivering additional crude or gas above their minimum threshold. We recognize revenue from these contracts based on the physical volume that is delivered to our systems in the current period and any minimum volume deficiency amounts billable to customers under the minimum volume features are recorded as a deferred revenue liability until we determine that the revenue is earned. We will recognize the deferred revenue as income at such time as the customer does not have the physical ability to make up the deficiency due to system capacity limitations or the contractually allowed recoupment period expires. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had deferred revenue of approximately $14.2 million and $12.2 million, which is reflected as accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States. Crestwood Equity owns a 99.9% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream and Crestwood Gas Services GP LLC (CGS GP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owns a 0.1% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream as of December 31, 2015. Crestwood Midstream's general partner, Crestwood Midstream GP LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, NGL and natural gas sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. We own or control:\n \u2022 natural gas facilities with approximately 2.6 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 481 MMcf/d of processing capacity, 40.9 Bcf of certificated working gas storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transmission capacity; \n \u2022 NGL facilities with approximately 24,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity and 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting more than 294,000 Bbls/d of NGLs; and \n \u2022 crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, approximately 1.5 million barrels of total storage capacity, 48,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity, and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity.  On May 5, 2015, Crestwood Equity, Crestwood Midstream and certain of its affiliates entered into a definitive agreement under which CMLP agreed to merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity (the Simplification Merger). On September 30, 2015, CMLP's unitholders approved the Simplification Merger and we completed the merger on that date. As part of the merger consideration, CMLP's common and preferred unitholders (other than the Company and our subsidiaries) received 2.75 common or preferred units of the Company for each common or preferred unit of CMLP held upon completion of the merger. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Equity contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to Crestwood Midstream. Crestwood Operations' assets consist primarily of the assets utilized by our NGL supply and logistics business, including our West Coast NGL operations, our Seymour NGL storage facility and our fleet of NGL transportation and related rail-to-truck terminal assets. As a result of these transactions, Crestwood Equity is a holding company and all of our operating assets and investments are owned by or through Crestwood Midstream.\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our business segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing (G&P), which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics (formerly NGL and crude services operations), which includes our NGL supply and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet, and salt production business. Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT and PRBIC operations are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations. All of our operations are conducted by or through Crestwood Midstream. Below is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays across the United States and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in the near term while commodity prices remain depressed, (ii) capture greater upside economics when commodity prices normalize, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nOur G&P operations primarily include:\n \u2022 Bakken Shale. We own and operate an integrated crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering system (the Arrow system) on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota. The Arrow system consists of 590 miles of low-pressure gathering pipeline capable of gathering 100 MMcf/d of natural gas, 125 MBbls/d of crude oil, and 40 MBbls/d of produced water. We also have approximately 266,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity at the Arrow central delivery point; \n \u2022 Marcellus Shale. We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison, Doddridge and Barbour Counties, West Virginia. These systems have a total gathering capacity of 875 MMcf/d and 138,080 horsepower of compression; \n \u2022 Barnett Shale. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 425 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Hood and Somervell Counties, Texas, which delivers the rich gas to our processing plant where NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream; and (ii) low-pressure gathering systems with a gathering capacity of 530 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Tarrant and Denton Counties, Texas; \n \u2022 Fayetteville Shale. We own and operate five low-pressure gas gathering systems with a gathering capacity of approximately 510 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Conway, Faulkner, Van Buren, and White Counties, Arkansas; \n \u2022 Delaware Permian. We own and operate low-pressure dry gas and rich natural gas systems with a primary focus on the Willow Lake system that includes a gathering and processing system with approximately 50 MMcf/d of capacity to serve our customers in Eddy County, New Mexico (Willow Lake system); \n \u2022 Other 100% Owned and Operated Systems. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 36 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Roberts County, Texas, and a processing plant that extracts NGLs from the natural gas stream (Granite Wash system); and (ii) high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines with a gathering capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d that provide gathering and treating services to our customers located in Sabine Parish, Louisiana (Haynesville/Bossier system); and \n \u2022 PRB Niobrara Shale. We own a 50% ownership interest in the Jackalope joint venture with Williams, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. The joint venture, operated by Williams, owns the Jackalope gas gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant. The Jackalope system is supported by a 20-year gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake under an area of dedication of approximately 388,000 gross acres in the core of the PRB Niobrara. \nAlthough the cash flows from our G&P operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with original terms ranging from 5-20 years, the results of our G&P operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. During 2015, two of our G&P customers, Quicksilver and Sabine filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In January 2016, Quicksilver executed an asset purchase agreement with a third party for the sale of its U.S. oil and gas assets. The sale is expected to close on March 31, 2016, pending certain closing conditions. On February 5, 2016, Quicksilver filed a motion to reject its gathering agreements with us. We filed an objection to this motion on February 26, 2016 and a hearing is scheduled in Delaware on March 4, 2016. We are in discussions with the third party regarding those agreements. We continue to provide services to Quicksilver, and the outcome of its restructuring process could have a material impact on our G&P segment's results of operations. Sabine continues to work with the bankruptcy court on its bankruptcy filing, and we continue to monitor their proceedings, and the outcome could impact our G&P segment's results of operations in the future.\nThe cash flows from our G&P operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality and weather fluctuations. We gather, process, treat, compress, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas pursuant to fixed-fee and, to a lesser extent, percent-of-proceeds contracts. We have historically taken title to the crude oil and natural gas volumes gathered under Arrow's fixed-fee contracts, and we remit netbacks to our producer customers based on the market prices at which we sell the crude oil and natural gas. On our other G&P systems, we do not take title to natural gas or NGLs under our fixed-fee contracts, whereas under our percent-of-proceeds contracts, we take title to the residue gas, NGLs and condensate and remit a portion of the sale proceeds to the producer based on prevailing commodity prices. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts minimizes our G&P segment's commodity price exposure and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur storage and transportation segment consists of our natural gas storage and transportation assets as follow:\n \u2022 Northeast Storage and Transportation. We have four natural gas storage facilities (Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Steuben and Seneca Lake) and three transportation pipelines (North/South Facilities, MARC I and the East Pipeline) located in the Northeast in or near the Marcellus Shale. Our storage facilities provide 40.9 Bcf of certificated firm storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity to producers, utilities, marketers and other customers. We believe the location of our storage and transportation assets in the Northeast relative to New York City and other premium demand markets along the East Coast helps to insulate our operations from production and commodity price changes that can more easily impact storage and transportation operators in other geographic regions, including Texas; \n \u2022 COLT Hub. We own and operate the COLT Hub, which is one of the largest crude oil rail terminals in the Bakken Shale based on actual throughput and which complements our Arrow acquisition. Located approximately 60 miles away from Arrow's central delivery point, the COLT Hub interconnects with the Arrow system through the Hiland and Tesoro pipeline systems. The hub, which can be sourced by numerous pipeline systems or truck, is capable of loading up to 160,000 Bbls/d and has approximately 1.2 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity; and \n \u2022 PRBIC. PRBIC, our 50% equity method investment, owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal, located in Douglas County, Wyoming, which provides a market for crude oil production from the PRB Niobrara. The joint venture, operated by Twin Eagle, sources crude oil production from Chesapeake and other PRB Niobrara producers. PRBIC includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity. Additionally, in anticipation of growing PRB Niobrara crude oil volumes, PRBIC expanded its pipeline terminal to include connections to Kinder Morgan's HH Pipeline system in July 2015 and initiated a pipeline project to interconnect with Plains All American Pipeline's Rocky Mountain Pipeline system, which is expected to be completed in March 2016. \n \u2022 Tres Holdings. We own a 50.01% ownership interest in Tres Holdings LLC (Tres Holdings), a joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and an affiliate of Brookfield, which owns the remaining 49.99% interest in Tres Holdings. Tres Holdings owns Tres Palacios, which owns a FERC-certificated 38.4 Bcf multi-cycle, salt dome natural gas storage facility. Its 63-mile, dual 24-inch diameter header system (including a 52-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 11-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 10 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan Inc.'s Houston central processing plant. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% membership interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings. As a result of the sale, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated Tres Palacios' operations. We account for the investment in Tres Holdings under the equity method of accounting. Brookfield and Tres Palacios entered into a five-year, fixed fee contract under which Tres Palacios will make 15 Bcf of firm storage capacity and 150,000 Dth/d of enhanced interruptible services available to Brookfield. \nThe cash flows from our storage and transportation operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with an original term ranging from 1-10 years. Our cash flows from interruptible and other hub services tends to increase during the peak winter season. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are largely supported by take-or-pay contracts with refiners and, to a lesser extent, marketer customers and are not significantly affected in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality or weather fluctuations. We are working to renew long-term storage and loading contracts associated with our COLT Hub operations. Several of these contracts expire in 2016 and we expect to extend the contract terms for several of our existing customers. We are also pursuing multiple pipeline and storage projects at the COLT terminal supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment consists of our NGL supply and logistics business and US Salt. We utilize our over-the-road and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics operations primarily include:\n \u2022 NGL Supply and Logistics Business. Our NGL supply and logistics business serves producers, refiners and other customers that produce or consume natural gas liquids, including primarily propane, butane and natural gasoline. To provide these services, we utilize our portfolio of proprietary and third party NGL processing, fractionation, storage, terminal and trucking assets including our fleet of rail and rolling stock, rail-to-truck terminals, West Coast processing, fractionation and storage operations, NGL storage facilities, and contracted capacity (including leased storage capacity at major hubs and leased transportation capacity on major NGL pipelines); \n \u2022 Crude Oil and Produced Water Trucking. Our crude oil and produced water trucking fleet has 48,000 Bbls/d of crude oil and produced water transportation capacity. These assets were acquired in the first half of 2014. We provide hauling services to customers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Texas and New Mexico; and \n \u2022 US Salt. Our salt production business, which has a plant near Watkins Glen, New York, is capable of producing more than 400,000 tons of evaporated salt products annually. US Salt's solution mining process creates underground caverns that can be developed into natural gas and NGL storage capacity. \nThe cash flows from our marketing, supply and logistics business represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods. The cash flows from our salt operations represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts that are less than one year in duration, and are relatively stable and not subject to seasonal or cyclical variation due to the use of, and demand for, salt products in everyday life.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our stakeholders by maximizing throughput on our assets, expanding our services and exercising prudent control of operating and administrative costs, resulting in stable operating margins and improving cash flows from operations. Our business strategy further depends on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees and develop growth projects that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have positioned the Company to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment. Many of our assets are located on long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays which are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of midstream infrastructure to flow production to market and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. We believe the diversity of our asset portfolio, wide range of services provided and extensive customer portfolio, taken together, provides us with a positive forward view of our ability to be successful in the current market which has been impacted by prolonged low commodity prices. In addition, a substantial portion of the midstream services we provide to customers in the shale plays are based on fixed fee, take-or-pay or cost-of-service agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. We are actively working with our customers to further improve the profitability of their operations through the services we offer, and in certain instances, by adjusting our rate, service and/or volume commitment structures to incentivize them to utilize our services in the short-term while preserving long-term flexibility in a challenging market. In particular, we are in active discussions with a number of our customers regarding amendments and/or extensions of their contracts, and these discussions will continue into 2016.\nIn 2016, we are evaluating strategic actions to substantially de-risk the investment profile of Crestwood and position the Company to emerge from this challenging market environment as a stronger, better capitalized company. These are designed to address our near-term cost of capital limitations and position the Company for long-term value creation for all stakeholders when the market improves and include reducing capital expenditures, further reducing costs, divesting of assets, evaluating distributions and strengthening the balance sheet including repayment of indebtedness.\nDuring 2015, we completed a number of cost-reduction efforts, including the Simplification Merger, and we decreased our on-going expenses related to operations, maintenance and general and administrative matters by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, excluding $29.4 million of upfront costs related to this cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. We continue to pursue additional opportunities to further reduce costs in 2016, which we believe will result in lower expenses in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be limited to previously committed contractual projects around our existing asset footprint of approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2016.\nBased on current operations, we expect financial results in 2016 that are relatively consistent with our 2015 results, despite continued anticipated depressed commodity prices. Through the execution of strategic efforts described above, we expect to reposition the Company for increasing stability and strength through a continued challenging market environment, which will over the long-term, best position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany activities within the energy midstream sector have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years, and we expect the trend of regulatory oversight to continue for the foreseeable future. We anticipate greater regulatory oversight related to activities that have attracted significant negative attention in the public domain (e.g., transportation of crude oil by rail). We also anticipate greater regulatory oversight in states like North Dakota and tribal sovereignties like the MHA Nation, where regulation in certain areas is now starting to align with the tremendous production growth experienced in those jurisdictions in a short period of time.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (net interest and debt expense and loss on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates for our proportionate share of their depreciation and interest. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, gains and losses on acquisition-related contingencies, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, certain costs related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory that these derivatives relate to. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nIn conjunction with the closing of the Simplification Merger on September 30, 2015, CEQP contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to CMLP, and as a result of this equity contribution, CMLP controls the operating and financial decisions of Crestwood Operations. CMLP accounted for this transaction as a reorganization of entities under common control and the accounting standards related to such transactions requires CMLP to retroactively adjust its historical results to reflect the operations of Crestwood Operations as being acquired on June 19, 2013, the date in which CMLP and Crestwood Operations came under common control. The contribution of Crestwood Operations to CMLP had no impact on CEQP's results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, primarily includes costs incurred related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the Simplification Merger, the Crestwood Merger and the Arrow Acquisition.\nSegment Results\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing operations; (ii) storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics operations (formerly NGL and crude services operations). Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT operations and PRBIC investment are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations.\nThe following tables summarize the EBITDA of our segments (in millions):\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>

years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGathering and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $250.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments of approximately $265.5 million recorded during 2015 related to our Fayetteville, Granite Wash and Haynesville operations, compared to $51.7 million of impairments during the year ended December 31, 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to CMLP's EBITDA decrease was a $769.1 million decrease in revenues, offset by a $756.0 million decrease in costs of products/services sold and a $13.8 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense. The revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $742.9 million partially offset by a decrease in its costs of product/services sold of $738.4 million. The decrease in product revenues and costs of product/services sold was driven by the decreases in market prices on crude oil, which caused average crude oil prices on our crude oil sales to decrease by approximately 50% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced a $21.7 million increase in Arrow's service revenues due to an increase of 14%, 30% and 49% in its crude oil, natural gas and water volumes, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, as new wells were connected to the system.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a decrease in our G&P segment's operations and maintenance expense of approximately $13.8 million compared to 2014 resulting from cost-reduction efforts undertaken in 2015, which is further described in Outlook and Trends above.\nCMLP's G&P segment EBITDA was also impacted by an $8.6 million loss on contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss on contingent consideration that reflected the fair value of an earn-out premium associated with the original acquisition of our Marcellus G&P assets from Antero Resources Appalachian Corporation (Antero) in 2012. The earn-out provision, which was settled in February 2015, allowed Antero to receive an additional $40.0 million payment when gathering volumes exceeded a certain threshold as defined in the acquisition agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million impairment of our Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope) equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from Jackalope increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to Jackalope placing its Bucking Horse processing plant in service in January 2015.\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $1,100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition to the impairments described above, CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA was impacted by $850.5 million of property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments related to our Barnett operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA increased by approximately $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of operations from our Arrow assets compared to two months in 2013. Arrow contributed EBITDA of approximately $55.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nRevenues increased by approximately $1,706.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. Arrow contributed revenues of approximately $1,884.3 million and $218.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The remaining revenue increase was primarily driven by higher gathering and compression volumes during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. We gathered approximately 1.2 Bcf/d of natural gas on our G&P systems during 2014 compared to 1.0 Bcf/d during 2013. Our compression volumes increased from 0.3 Bcf/d during 2013 to 0.5 Bcf/d in 2014. The increases in our G&P gathering and compression volumes\nwere primarily due to several new compressor stations placed in service during 2013 and 2014 in the Marcellus Shale and new wells connected to our systems during 2014.\nPartially offsetting the increases described above were higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 of approximately $1,592.4 million and $44.1 million primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. The remaining increase in our costs of product/services sold was primarily due to higher volumes gathered on our New Mexico gathering systems under a gathering and processing agreement we entered into with Trinity River Energy in April 2014 and increased production at Granite Wash due to new wells connected during 2014.\nIn addition to the higher costs discussed above, CEQP's G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million and $31.4 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as described above.\nWe recorded impairments of $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our Granite Wash and Fayetteville operations compared to $4.1 million of impairments recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to our Haynesville operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $631.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $623.4 million goodwill impairment recorded related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of this goodwill impairment, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA were higher operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the expansion of the COLT Hub facility (including the release and departure tracks placed in service in December 2014) and other expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, primarily the NS-1 Expansion project.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA described above were higher revenues of approximately $15.5 million and lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $2.7 million. The increase in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of our expansion of the facility discussed above and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system, which resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we loaded approximately 117 MBbls/d of crude on rail cars entering the facility compared to 110 MBbls/d in 2014. Also contributing to the revenue increase was additional firm transportation services resulting from expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015 which increased volumes delivered into Millennium Pipeline. Partially offsetting these revenue increases, was a reduction in firm storage revenues due to recontracting efforts yielding rates which were lower in 2015 compared to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged 1.5 Bcf/d in both years.\nAlso impacting CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was a $23.4 million impairment of our PRBIC equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from our PRBIC investment increased by $4.9 million.\nIn December 2014, Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield formed the Tres Holdings joint venture and during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded equity earnings of approximately $2.5 million and $0.2 million from Tres Holdings.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $663.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition, in December 2014, CEQP sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to the newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million (of which approximately $66.4 million was paid by Crestwood Midstream), and as a result, CEQP deconsolidated Tres Palacios. Tres Palacios generated approximately $0.4 million of EBITDA to CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA prior to its deconsolidation on December 1, 2014. CEQP recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the portion of the sale related to Brookfield. For a further discussion of our investment in Tres Holdings, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur storage and transportation segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our storage and transportation segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $138.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was due to our 2014 results having a full year of operating results compared to only six months in 2013. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the sale of our Tres Palacios membership interest as discussed above.\nWe experienced an increase in demand for our storage and transportation services as evidenced by higher usage on our firm storage and transportation contracts and increased volumes from interruptible services, resulting from increased producer activity and increased locational basis spreads in the Northeast, which was the primary driver for the increase in revenues of approximately $88.7 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf/d compared to 1.4 Bcf/d during 2013. The remaining increase in revenues of approximately $45.0 million was due primarily to having a full year of operations from our COLT Hub assets in 2014 compared to six months in 2013. In addition, we experienced higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of the expansion of the facility and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system. During 2014 and 2013, we loaded approximately 110 MBbls/d and 82 MBbls/d of crude oil on rail cars entering the facility.\nPartially offsetting the increases in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's revenues were higher costs of product/services sold primarily related to higher throughput volumes at our North-South and MARC I facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense due to having a full year of storage and transportation operations in 2014 compared to six months in 2013.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $469.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to impairments of property, plant and equipment and goodwill of approximately $484.4 million related to our West Coast, Watkins Glen, supply and logistics, storage and terminals and trucking operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $31.6 million related to Watkins Glen and US Salt operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA was a year over year decrease in revenues of approximately $531.1 million, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $512.6 million. These revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, and include approximately $18.9 million and $51.2 million of gains on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations decreased by $541.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared 2014, compared to a decrease of $527.2 million in its costs of product/services sold year over year. These decreases were driven by decreased demand for propane and butane at our NGL terminals and other facilities resulting from lower commodity prices, and the fact that we experienced a milder winter during early 2015 compared to the unusually cold winter during 2014, which reduced our opportunities to capture incremental demand and margin opportunities in these operations.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nEBITDA for CEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $468.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our NGL and crude services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA increased by approximately $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher revenues of $664.1 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense of $597.0 million. Our costs of product/services sold included $51.2 million of gains and $11.2 million of losses on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we recorded $31.6 million of impairments of our Watkins Glen and US Salt reporting units in 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nOur NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations produced CEQP EBITDA of $75.6 million and $25.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase was due primarily to our 2014 results having a full year of operating compared to six months in 2013.\nOther EBITDA Results\nAs discussed in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule, Note 17, our corporate operations include all general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to our reporting segments, however such expenses impact our consolidated EBITDA.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CEQP incurred costs of $32.4 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CEQP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. CEQP's general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of expenses related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition, partially offset by approximately $40.6 million of transaction costs incurred in 2013 primarily related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CMLP incurred costs of $23.9 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CMLP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense - During the year ended December 31, 2015, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased compared to 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the assets acquired during 2014 and the Crestwood Merger in June 2013. For a further discussion of our acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nInterest and Debt Expense - Interest and debt expense, net increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013, primarily due to (i) the issuance of $700 million of 6.25% senior notes in March 2015; (ii) higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities; (iii) the assumption of $1.1 billion of long-term debt due to the Crestwood Merger in June 2013; and (iv) the issuance of $600 million of 6.125% senior notes in November 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were repayments of CEQP's credit facility in conjunction with the Simplification Merger, the redemption of Crestwood Midstream's 2019 Senior Notes and repayments of Crestwood Midstream's $1.0 billion credit facility.\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense (in millions):\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CEQP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CMLP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>108.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt-related costs\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest and debt expense\n</td> <td>142.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: capitalized interest\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and debt expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, credit facilities, debt issuances, and sales of common and preferred units. Our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements based on our successful execution of our strategy detailed in Outlook and Trends above.\nContemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Midstream amended and restated its senior secured credit agreement to provide for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the CMLP Credit Facility), which expires in September 2020. On September 30, 2015, Crestwood Midstream borrowed approximately $720 million under the CMLP Credit Facility to (i) repay all borrowings outstanding under its $1.0 billion credit facility, (ii) fund a distribution to CEQP of approximately $378.3 million for purposes of repaying (or, if applicable, satisfying and discharging) substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and (iii) pay merger-related fees and expenses. As of December 31, 2015, Crestwood Midstream had $399.0 million of available capacity under its credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in its credit agreement. Crestwood Midstream also has approximately $1.8 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015, with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2023. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 8 for a more detailed discussion of the CMLP Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all our debt covenants related to the CMLP credit facility and CMLP senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the CMLP Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe our current liquidity sources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our future operating and capital requirements.\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(212.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(483.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,042.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(236.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>859.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows increased approximately $157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $169.7 million net cash inflow from working capital resulting primarily from lesser working capital requirements of our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, primarily due to lower commodity prices. In addition, we experienced a $1,298.5 million decrease in operating revenues primarily from our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $1,281.1 million primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices on our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 our operating cash flows increased approximately $94.7 million compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to the Crestwood Merger and the acquisition of our Arrow operations which occurred in June 2013 and November 2013, respectively. These acquisitions contributed higher operating revenues of $2,504.6 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold, operations and maintenance expense and general and administrative expense of approximately $2,268.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, our interest paid increased approximately $49.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities.\nInvesting Activities\nThe energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements. \nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions). We have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flow and earnings.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>182.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(73.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents gross purchases of property, plant and equipment that are reimbursable by third parties. \nIn addition to the capital expenditures described in the table above, our cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the following significant items during the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nAcquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid approximately $19.5 million and $555.6 million to acquire our transportation fleet from Red Rock and LT Enterprises in 2014 and our Arrow assets in 2013. For a further discussion of these acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment. Our purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by approximately $77 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to organic growth projects placed in service related to our Marcellus assets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired a 50% interest in Jackalope and a 50.01% interest in PRBIC for approximately $107.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we contributed approximately $42.0 million, $108.6 million and $21.5 million to our\nequity investments. For a further discussion of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nProceeds from the Sale of Tres Palacios. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings, a newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream's consolidated subsidiary and an affiliate of Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million. As a result of this transaction, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated the operations of Tres Palacios. Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield paid approximately $66.4 million each to acquire their respective interests in Tres Palacios. For a further discussion of our sale in Tres Palacios, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nFinancing Activities\nSignificant items impacting our financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included the following:\nEquity Transactions\n \u2022 Increase in distributions to partners of approximately $69.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $34.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in the number of limited partner units outstanding; \n \u2022 Decrease in distributions to non-controlling partners of approximately $62.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the Simplification Merger and a $92.0 million increase in distributions to non-controlling partners in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the Crestwood Merger; \n \u2022 $58.8 million and $430.5 million net proceeds from the issuance of Crestwood Midstream's Class A Preferred Units in 2015 and 2014, respectively, prior to the completion of the Simplification Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CEQP issued 1,372,573 preferred units to its preferred unitholders in lieu of paying a quarterly cash distribution of $12.5 million, and CEQP has the option of continuing to issue preferred units to its preferred unitholders in lieu of paying cash distributions throughout 2016; \n \u2022 $53.9 million and $96.1 million net proceeds from the issuance of preferred security units to GE in 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $11.3 million of cash distributions on these units to GE, and no longer have the option to pay distributions by issuing additional preferred units to GE; \n \u2022 $129.0 million distribution to Crestwood Holdings for the acquisition of Legacy Crestwood's additional interest in Crestwood Marcellus Midstream LLC in 2013; and \n \u2022 $714.0 million net proceeds from the issuance of Crestwood Midstream's common units in 2013. \nDebt Transactions\n \u2022 $688.3 million net proceeds from Crestwood Midstream's issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes in 2015; \n \u2022 $363.6 million redemption of Crestwood Midstream's 2019 Senior Notes in 2015; \n \u2022 $332.8 million increase in net repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities in 2015 compared to 2014; and \n \u2022 $340.2 million decrease in net borrowings of long-term debt in 2014 compared to 2013. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are party to various contractual obligations. A portion of these obligations are reflected in our financial statements, such as long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, while other obligations, such as operating leases, capital commitments and contractual interest amounts are not reflected on our balance sheet. The following table and discussion summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in millions):\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,239.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,543.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(1)\n</td> <td>132.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>753.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum payments under operating leases(2)\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum payments under capital leases(2)\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed price commodity purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td>156.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>62.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments and other contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,483.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,703.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) $735.0 million of our long-term debt is variable interest rate debt at prime rate or LIBOR plus an applicable spread. These rates plus their applicable spreads were between 2.70% and 5.00% at December 31, 2015. These rates have been applied for each period presented in the table. \n (2) See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 15 for a further discussion of these obligations. \n (3) Fixed price purchase commitments are volumetrically offset by third party fixed price sale contracts. \n (4) Primarily related to growth and maintenance contractual purchase obligations in our G&P segment, the development of a rail terminal project, certain upgrades to the US Salt facility, and environmental obligations included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet. Other contractual purchase obligations are defined as legally enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that have fixed or minimum quantities and fixed or minimum variable price provisions, and that detail approximate timing of the underlying obligations. \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future\ngrowth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCommodity prices have continued to decline since late 2014, and that decline has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2015 and 2014. The following table summarizes the goodwill of our various reporting units (in millions):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering and Processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Fayetteville\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marcellus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arrow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Northeast Storage and Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>726.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COLT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>623.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Coast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>US Salt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watkins Glen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Crestwood Midstream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,234.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,149.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barnett (Gathering and Processing)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Crestwood Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,491.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe goodwill impairments recorded during 2015 primarily resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the reporting units considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our customers. We utilized discount rates ranging from 10% to 16% to determine the fair value of our reporting units as of December 31, 2015.\nWe continue to monitor the remaining goodwill described in the table above, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. In particular, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses that recorded goodwill impairments in 2015 could have resulted in an additional $45 million and $55 million of goodwill impairments as of December 31, 2015, respectively. For more information about the market for our common equity, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nIn addition, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rate utilized to determine the fair value of our Northeast Storage and Transportation business could result in the fair value of that business falling below the carrying value of the business, which could result in a goodwill impairment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in that reporting unit. During 2015 and 2014, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\n \u2022 During 2015 and 2014, we incurred $8.5 million and $33.2 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Granite Wash gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our major customer of those assets has declared bankruptcy and has ceased any substantial drilling in the Granite Wash in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas and NGLs. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $593.3 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Barnett gathering and processing operations, which resulted from the recent actions of our primary customer in the Barnett Shale, Quicksilver, related to its filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2015. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $185.5 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Fayetteville and Haynesville gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our customers for those assets have ceased any substantial drilling in the Fayetteville and Haynesville Shales in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $31.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment related to our Watkins Glen marketing, supply and logistics segment development project, which resulted from continued delays and uncertainties in the permitting of our proposed NGL storage facility. \nOur other operations that incurred goodwill impairments during 2015 did not incur significant impairments on their long-lived assets based on our assessment that the undiscounted cash flows related to those assets exceeded their carrying value at December 31, 2015.\nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity-Method Investments\nWe acquired our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments in 2013, which required us to record the respective investments at fair value on the date they were acquired. We evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity-method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity-method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity-method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity-method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity-method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nBecause our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments were acquired in 2013, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these investments or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those investments from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the equity-method investment falling below their carrying value, and could result in an assessment of whether that investment is impaired.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million and $23.4 million impairment of our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments, respectively, as a result of decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rate utilized in determining the fair value of the equity-method investment considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our equity-method investments' customers.\nWe continue to monitor our equity-method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity-method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe gather, treat, compress, process, store, transport and sell various commodities pursuant to fixed-fee and percent-of-proceeds contracts. We recognize revenue on these contracts when certain criteria are met, the most important of which is that the delivery of the service has been performed. Certain of our contracts in our gathering and processing segment and storage and transportation segment contain minimum volume features under which the customers must deliver a set quantity of crude or gas or pay a deficiency fee based on the amount the customers' actual volume is short of the contractual minimum volume. The\nminimum volume feature generally allows customers a recoupment period in subsequent periods to make up certain previous volumetric shortfalls by delivering additional crude or gas above their minimum threshold. We recognize revenue from these contracts based on the physical volume that is delivered to our systems in the current period and any minimum volume deficiency amounts billable to customers under the minimum volume features are recorded as a deferred revenue liability until we determine that the revenue is earned. We will recognize the deferred revenue as income at such time as the customer does not have the physical ability to make up the deficiency due to system capacity limitations or the contractually allowed recoupment period expires. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had deferred revenue of approximately $14.2 million and $12.2 million, which is reflected as accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes.\nThis report, including information included or incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements concerning the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of our company and its subsidiaries.

Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States. Crestwood Equity owns a 99.9% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream and Crestwood Gas Services GP LLC (CGS GP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owns a 0.1% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream as of December 31, 2015. Crestwood Midstream's general partner, Crestwood Midstream GP LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, NGL and natural gas sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. We own or control:\n \u2022 natural gas facilities with approximately 2.6 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 481 MMcf/d of processing capacity, 40.9 Bcf of certificated working gas storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transmission capacity; \n \u2022 NGL facilities with approximately 24,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity and 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting more than 294,000 Bbls/d of NGLs; and \n \u2022 crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, approximately 1.5 million barrels of total storage capacity, 48,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity, and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity.  On May 5, 2015, Crestwood Equity, Crestwood Midstream and certain of its affiliates entered into a definitive agreement under which CMLP agreed to merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity (the Simplification Merger). On September 30, 2015, CMLP's unitholders approved the Simplification Merger and we completed the merger on that date. As part of the merger consideration, CMLP's common and preferred unitholders (other than the Company and our subsidiaries) received 2.75 common or preferred units of the Company for each common or preferred unit of CMLP held upon completion of the merger. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Equity contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to Crestwood Midstream. Crestwood Operations' assets consist primarily of the assets utilized by our NGL supply and logistics business, including our West Coast NGL operations, our Seymour NGL storage facility and our fleet of NGL transportation and related rail-to-truck terminal assets. As a result of these transactions, Crestwood Equity is a holding company and all of our operating assets and investments are owned by or through Crestwood Midstream.\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our business segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing (G&P), which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics (formerly NGL and crude services operations), which includes our NGL supply and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet, and salt production business. Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT and PRBIC operations are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations. All of our operations are conducted by or through Crestwood Midstream. Below is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays across the United States and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in the near term while commodity prices remain depressed, (ii) capture greater upside economics when commodity prices normalize, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nOur G&P operations primarily include:\n \u2022 Bakken Shale. We own and operate an integrated crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering system (the Arrow system) on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota. The Arrow system consists of 590 miles of low-pressure gathering pipeline capable of gathering 100 MMcf/d of natural gas, 125 MBbls/d of crude oil, and 40 MBbls/d of produced water. We also have approximately 266,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity at the Arrow central delivery point; \n \u2022 Marcellus Shale. We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison, Doddridge and Barbour Counties, West Virginia. These systems have a total gathering capacity of 875 MMcf/d and 138,080 horsepower of compression; \n \u2022 Barnett Shale. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 425 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Hood and Somervell Counties, Texas, which delivers the rich gas to our processing plant where NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream; and (ii) low-pressure gathering systems with a gathering capacity of 530 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Tarrant and Denton Counties, Texas; \n \u2022 Fayetteville Shale. We own and operate five low-pressure gas gathering systems with a gathering capacity of approximately 510 MMcf/d of dry natural gas produced by our customers in Conway, Faulkner, Van Buren, and White Counties, Arkansas; \n \u2022 Delaware Permian. We own and operate low-pressure dry gas and rich natural gas systems with a primary focus on the Willow Lake system that includes a gathering and processing system with approximately 50 MMcf/d of capacity to serve our customers in Eddy County, New Mexico (Willow Lake system); \n \u2022 Other 100% Owned and Operated Systems. We own and operate (i) a low-pressure natural gas gathering system with a gathering capacity of approximately 36 MMcf/d of rich gas produced by our customers in Roberts County, Texas, and a processing plant that extracts NGLs from the natural gas stream (Granite Wash system); and (ii) high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines with a gathering capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d that provide gathering and treating services to our customers located in Sabine Parish, Louisiana (Haynesville/Bossier system); and \n \u2022 PRB Niobrara Shale. We own a 50% ownership interest in the Jackalope joint venture with Williams, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. The joint venture, operated by Williams, owns the Jackalope gas gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant. The Jackalope system is supported by a 20-year gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake under an area of dedication of approximately 388,000 gross acres in the core of the PRB Niobrara. \nAlthough the cash flows from our G&P operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with original terms ranging from 5-20 years, the results of our G&P operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. During 2015, two of our G&P customers, Quicksilver and Sabine filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In January 2016, Quicksilver executed an asset purchase agreement with a third party for the sale of its U.S. oil and gas assets. The sale is expected to close on March 31, 2016, pending certain closing conditions. On February 5, 2016, Quicksilver filed a motion to reject its gathering agreements with us. We filed an objection to this motion on February 26, 2016 and a hearing is scheduled in Delaware on March 4, 2016. We are in discussions with the third party regarding those agreements. We continue to provide services to Quicksilver, and the outcome of its restructuring process could have a material impact on our G&P segment's results of operations. Sabine continues to work with the bankruptcy court on its bankruptcy filing, and we continue to monitor their proceedings, and the outcome could impact our G&P segment's results of operations in the future.\nThe cash flows from our G&P operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality and weather fluctuations. We gather, process, treat, compress, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas pursuant to fixed-fee and, to a lesser extent, percent-of-proceeds contracts. We have historically taken title to the crude oil and natural gas volumes gathered under Arrow's fixed-fee contracts, and we remit netbacks to our producer customers based on the market prices at which we sell the crude oil and natural gas. On our other G&P systems, we do not take title to natural gas or NGLs under our fixed-fee contracts, whereas under our percent-of-proceeds contracts, we take title to the residue gas, NGLs and condensate and remit a portion of the sale proceeds to the producer based on prevailing commodity prices. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts minimizes our G&P segment's commodity price exposure and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur storage and transportation segment consists of our natural gas storage and transportation assets as follow:\n \u2022 Northeast Storage and Transportation. We have four natural gas storage facilities (Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Steuben and Seneca Lake) and three transportation pipelines (North/South Facilities, MARC I and the East Pipeline) located in the Northeast in or near the Marcellus Shale. Our storage facilities provide 40.9 Bcf of certificated firm storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity to producers, utilities, marketers and other customers. We believe the location of our storage and transportation assets in the Northeast relative to New York City and other premium demand markets along the East Coast helps to insulate our operations from production and commodity price changes that can more easily impact storage and transportation operators in other geographic regions, including Texas; \n \u2022 COLT Hub. We own and operate the COLT Hub, which is one of the largest crude oil rail terminals in the Bakken Shale based on actual throughput and which complements our Arrow acquisition. Located approximately 60 miles away from Arrow's central delivery point, the COLT Hub interconnects with the Arrow system through the Hiland and Tesoro pipeline systems. The hub, which can be sourced by numerous pipeline systems or truck, is capable of loading up to 160,000 Bbls/d and has approximately 1.2 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity; and \n \u2022 PRBIC. PRBIC, our 50% equity method investment, owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal, located in Douglas County, Wyoming, which provides a market for crude oil production from the PRB Niobrara. The joint venture, operated by Twin Eagle, sources crude oil production from Chesapeake and other PRB Niobrara producers. PRBIC includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity. Additionally, in anticipation of growing PRB Niobrara crude oil volumes, PRBIC expanded its pipeline terminal to include connections to Kinder Morgan's HH Pipeline system in July 2015 and initiated a pipeline project to interconnect with Plains All American Pipeline's Rocky Mountain Pipeline system, which is expected to be completed in March 2016. \n \u2022 Tres Holdings. We own a 50.01% ownership interest in Tres Holdings LLC (Tres Holdings), a joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and an affiliate of Brookfield, which owns the remaining 49.99% interest in Tres Holdings. Tres Holdings owns Tres Palacios, which owns a FERC-certificated 38.4 Bcf multi-cycle, salt dome natural gas storage facility. Its 63-mile, dual 24-inch diameter header system (including a 52-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 11-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 10 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan Inc.'s Houston central processing plant. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% membership interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings. As a result of the sale, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated Tres Palacios' operations. We account for the investment in Tres Holdings under the equity method of accounting. Brookfield and Tres Palacios entered into a five-year, fixed fee contract under which Tres Palacios will make 15 Bcf of firm storage capacity and 150,000 Dth/d of enhanced interruptible services available to Brookfield. \nThe cash flows from our storage and transportation operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with an original term ranging from 1-10 years. Our cash flows from interruptible and other hub services tends to increase during the peak winter season. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are largely supported by take-or-pay contracts with refiners and, to a lesser extent, marketer customers and are not significantly affected in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality or weather fluctuations. We are working to renew long-term storage and loading contracts associated with our COLT Hub operations. Several of these contracts expire in 2016 and we expect to extend the contract terms for several of our existing customers. We are also pursuing multiple pipeline and storage projects at the COLT terminal supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment consists of our NGL supply and logistics business and US Salt. We utilize our over-the-road and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics operations primarily include:\n \u2022 NGL Supply and Logistics Business. Our NGL supply and logistics business serves producers, refiners and other customers that produce or consume natural gas liquids, including primarily propane, butane and natural gasoline. To provide these services, we utilize our portfolio of proprietary and third party NGL processing, fractionation, storage, terminal and trucking assets including our fleet of rail and rolling stock, rail-to-truck terminals, West Coast processing, fractionation and storage operations, NGL storage facilities, and contracted capacity (including leased storage capacity at major hubs and leased transportation capacity on major NGL pipelines); \n \u2022 Crude Oil and Produced Water Trucking. Our crude oil and produced water trucking fleet has 48,000 Bbls/d of crude oil and produced water transportation capacity. These assets were acquired in the first half of 2014. We provide hauling services to customers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Texas and New Mexico; and \n \u2022 US Salt. Our salt production business, which has a plant near Watkins Glen, New York, is capable of producing more than 400,000 tons of evaporated salt products annually. US Salt's solution mining process creates underground caverns that can be developed into natural gas and NGL storage capacity. \nThe cash flows from our marketing, supply and logistics business represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods. The cash flows from our salt operations represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts that are less than one year in duration, and are relatively stable and not subject to seasonal or cyclical variation due to the use of, and demand for, salt products in everyday life.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our stakeholders by maximizing throughput on our assets, expanding our services and exercising prudent control of operating and administrative costs, resulting in stable operating margins and improving cash flows from operations. Our business strategy further depends on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees and develop growth projects that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have positioned the Company to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment. Many of our assets are located on long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays which are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of midstream infrastructure to flow production to market and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. We believe the diversity of our asset portfolio, wide range of services provided and extensive customer portfolio, taken together, provides us with a positive forward view of our ability to be successful in the current market which has been impacted by prolonged low commodity prices. In addition, a substantial portion of the midstream services we provide to customers in the shale plays are based on fixed fee, take-or-pay or cost-of-service agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. We are actively working with our customers to further improve the profitability of their operations through the services we offer, and in certain instances, by adjusting our rate, service and/or volume commitment structures to incentivize them to utilize our services in the short-term while preserving long-term flexibility in a challenging market. In particular, we are in active discussions with a number of our customers regarding amendments and/or extensions of their contracts, and these discussions will continue into 2016.\nIn 2016, we are evaluating strategic actions to substantially de-risk the investment profile of Crestwood and position the Company to emerge from this challenging market environment as a stronger, better capitalized company. These are designed to address our near-term cost of capital limitations and position the Company for long-term value creation for all stakeholders when the market improves and include reducing capital expenditures, further reducing costs, divesting of assets, evaluating distributions and strengthening the balance sheet including repayment of indebtedness.\nDuring 2015, we completed a number of cost-reduction efforts, including the Simplification Merger, and we decreased our on-going expenses related to operations, maintenance and general and administrative matters by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, excluding $29.4 million of upfront costs related to this cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. We continue to pursue additional opportunities to further reduce costs in 2016, which we believe will result in lower expenses in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be limited to previously committed contractual projects around our existing asset footprint of approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2016.\nBased on current operations, we expect financial results in 2016 that are relatively consistent with our 2015 results, despite continued anticipated depressed commodity prices. Through the execution of strategic efforts described above, we expect to reposition the Company for increasing stability and strength through a continued challenging market environment, which will over the long-term, best position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany activities within the energy midstream sector have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years, and we expect the trend of regulatory oversight to continue for the foreseeable future. We anticipate greater regulatory oversight related to activities that have attracted significant negative attention in the public domain (e.g., transportation of crude oil by rail). We also anticipate greater regulatory oversight in states like North Dakota and tribal sovereignties like the MHA Nation, where regulation in certain areas is now starting to align with the tremendous production growth experienced in those jurisdictions in a short period of time.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (net interest and debt expense and loss on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates for our proportionate share of their depreciation and interest. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, gains and losses on acquisition-related contingencies, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, certain costs related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory that these derivatives relate to. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nIn conjunction with the closing of the Simplification Merger on September 30, 2015, CEQP contributed 100% of its interest in Crestwood Operations to CMLP, and as a result of this equity contribution, CMLP controls the operating and financial decisions of Crestwood Operations. CMLP accounted for this transaction as a reorganization of entities under common control and the accounting standards related to such transactions requires CMLP to retroactively adjust its historical results to reflect the operations of Crestwood Operations as being acquired on June 19, 2013, the date in which CMLP and Crestwood Operations came under common control. The contribution of Crestwood Operations to CMLP had no impact on CEQP's results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31 (in millions).\n\n\n(1) Significant transaction and environmental-related costs and other items for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, primarily includes costs incurred related to our 2015 cost savings initiatives, the Simplification Merger, the Crestwood Merger and the Arrow Acquisition.\nSegment Results\nIn conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our segments and our financial statements now reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing operations; (ii) storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics operations (formerly NGL and crude services operations). Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT operations and PRBIC investment are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations.\nThe following tables summarize the EBITDA of our segments (in millions):\n\n\nSegment Results\nBelow is a discussion of the factors that impacted EBITDA by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nGathering and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $250.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments of approximately $265.5 million recorded during 2015 related to our Fayetteville, Granite Wash and Haynesville operations, compared to $51.7 million of impairments during the year ended December 31, 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to CMLP's EBITDA decrease was a $769.1 million decrease in revenues, offset by a $756.0 million decrease in costs of products/services sold and a $13.8 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense. The revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $742.9 million partially offset by a decrease in its costs of product/services sold of $738.4 million. The decrease in product revenues and costs of product/services sold was driven by the decreases in market prices on crude oil, which caused average crude oil prices on our crude oil sales to decrease by approximately 50% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced a $21.7 million increase in Arrow's service revenues due to an increase of 14%, 30% and 49% in its crude oil, natural gas and water volumes, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, as new wells were connected to the system.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a decrease in our G&P segment's operations and maintenance expense of approximately $13.8 million compared to 2014 resulting from cost-reduction efforts undertaken in 2015, which is further described in Outlook and Trends above.\nCMLP's G&P segment EBITDA was also impacted by an $8.6 million loss on contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss on contingent consideration that reflected the fair value of an earn-out premium associated with the original acquisition of our Marcellus G&P assets from Antero Resources Appalachian Corporation (Antero) in 2012. The earn-out provision, which was settled in February 2015, allowed Antero to receive an additional $40.0 million payment when gathering volumes exceeded a certain threshold as defined in the acquisition agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million impairment of our Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope) equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from Jackalope increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to Jackalope placing its Bucking Horse processing plant in service in January 2015.\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment decreased by approximately $1,100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition to the impairments described above, CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA was impacted by $850.5 million of property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and goodwill impairments related to our Barnett operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nEBITDA for CEQP's G&P segment EBITDA increased by approximately $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of operations from our Arrow assets compared to two months in 2013. Arrow contributed EBITDA of approximately $55.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nRevenues increased by approximately $1,706.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. Arrow contributed revenues of approximately $1,884.3 million and $218.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The remaining revenue increase was primarily driven by higher gathering and compression volumes during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. We gathered approximately 1.2 Bcf/d of natural gas on our G&P systems during 2014 compared to 1.0 Bcf/d during 2013. Our compression volumes increased from 0.3 Bcf/d during 2013 to 0.5 Bcf/d in 2014. The increases in our G&P gathering and compression volumes\nwere primarily due to several new compressor stations placed in service during 2013 and 2014 in the Marcellus Shale and new wells connected to our systems during 2014.\nPartially offsetting the increases described above were higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 of approximately $1,592.4 million and $44.1 million primarily due to our Arrow operations as discussed above. The remaining increase in our costs of product/services sold was primarily due to higher volumes gathered on our New Mexico gathering systems under a gathering and processing agreement we entered into with Trinity River Energy in April 2014 and increased production at Granite Wash due to new wells connected during 2014.\nIn addition to the higher costs discussed above, CEQP's G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million and $31.4 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as described above.\nWe recorded impairments of $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our Granite Wash and Fayetteville operations compared to $4.1 million of impairments recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to our Haynesville operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $631.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $623.4 million goodwill impairment recorded related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of this goodwill impairment, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA were higher operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the expansion of the COLT Hub facility (including the release and departure tracks placed in service in December 2014) and other expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, primarily the NS-1 Expansion project.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA described above were higher revenues of approximately $15.5 million and lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $2.7 million. The increase in CMLP's storage and transportation segment's revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of our expansion of the facility discussed above and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system, which resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we loaded approximately 117 MBbls/d of crude on rail cars entering the facility compared to 110 MBbls/d in 2014. Also contributing to the revenue increase was additional firm transportation services resulting from expansion projects placed in service during the last half of 2014 and the first half of 2015 which increased volumes delivered into Millennium Pipeline. Partially offsetting these revenue increases, was a reduction in firm storage revenues due to recontracting efforts yielding rates which were lower in 2015 compared to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged 1.5 Bcf/d in both years.\nAlso impacting CMLP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was a $23.4 million impairment of our PRBIC equity investment. Offsetting this impairment, our equity earnings from our PRBIC investment increased by $4.9 million.\nIn December 2014, Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield formed the Tres Holdings joint venture and during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded equity earnings of approximately $2.5 million and $0.2 million from Tres Holdings.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $663.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP. In addition, in December 2014, CEQP sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to the newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million (of which approximately $66.4 million was paid by Crestwood Midstream), and as a result, CEQP deconsolidated Tres Palacios. Tres Palacios generated approximately $0.4 million of EBITDA to CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA prior to its deconsolidation on December 1, 2014. CEQP recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the portion of the sale related to Brookfield. For a further discussion of our investment in Tres Holdings, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur storage and transportation segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our storage and transportation segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $138.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was due to our 2014 results having a full year of operating results compared to only six months in 2013. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain of approximately $30.6 million on the sale of our Tres Palacios membership interest as discussed above.\nWe experienced an increase in demand for our storage and transportation services as evidenced by higher usage on our firm storage and transportation contracts and increased volumes from interruptible services, resulting from increased producer activity and increased locational basis spreads in the Northeast, which was the primary driver for the increase in revenues of approximately $88.7 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2014, total firm throughput from our Northeast storage and transportation services averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf/d compared to 1.4 Bcf/d during 2013. The remaining increase in revenues of approximately $45.0 million was due primarily to having a full year of operations from our COLT Hub assets in 2014 compared to six months in 2013. In addition, we experienced higher volumes on our COLT Hub as a result of the expansion of the facility and increased utilization of non-firm capacity on the system. During 2014 and 2013, we loaded approximately 110 MBbls/d and 82 MBbls/d of crude oil on rail cars entering the facility.\nPartially offsetting the increases in CEQP's storage and transportation segment's revenues were higher costs of product/services sold primarily related to higher throughput volumes at our North-South and MARC I facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense due to having a full year of storage and transportation operations in 2014 compared to six months in 2013.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nEBITDA for CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $469.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to impairments of property, plant and equipment and goodwill of approximately $484.4 million related to our West Coast, Watkins Glen, supply and logistics, storage and terminals and trucking operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $31.6 million related to Watkins Glen and US Salt operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nAlso contributing to the decrease in CMLP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA was a year over year decrease in revenues of approximately $531.1 million, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $512.6 million. These revenue and costs of product/services sold decreases were primarily driven by our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, and include approximately $18.9 million and $51.2 million of gains on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations decreased by $541.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared 2014, compared to a decrease of $527.2 million in its costs of product/services sold year over year. These decreases were driven by decreased demand for propane and butane at our NGL terminals and other facilities resulting from lower commodity prices, and the fact that we experienced a milder winter during early 2015 compared to the unusually cold winter during 2014, which reduced our opportunities to capture incremental demand and margin opportunities in these operations.\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nEBITDA for CEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment decreased by approximately $468.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, due to all of the factors as discussed above for CMLP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur marketing, supply and logistics segment results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning June 19, 2013 (the date that Crestwood Holdings acquired control of CEQP's general partner), which should be considered in the following discussion of the results of operations of our NGL and crude services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCEQP's marketing, supply and logistics segment's EBITDA increased by approximately $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher revenues of $664.1 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold and operations and maintenance expense of $597.0 million. Our costs of product/services sold included $51.2 million of gains and $11.2 million of losses on our commodity-based derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we recorded $31.6 million of impairments of our Watkins Glen and US Salt reporting units in 2014. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Part IV, Item 15. Financial Statements Schedules, Note 2.\nOur NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations produced CEQP EBITDA of $75.6 million and $25.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase was due primarily to our 2014 results having a full year of operating compared to six months in 2013.\nOther EBITDA Results\nAs discussed in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule, Note 17, our corporate operations include all general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to our reporting segments, however such expenses impact our consolidated EBITDA.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CEQP incurred costs of $32.4 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CEQP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. CEQP's general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our 2014 results having a full year of expenses related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition, partially offset by approximately $40.6 million of transaction costs incurred in 2013 primarily related to the Crestwood Merger and Arrow Acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CMLP incurred costs of $23.9 million primarily related to our 2015 cost savings initiative and the Simplification Merger. Offsetting the impact of these costs, general and administrative expenses related to CMLP's Corporate operations decreased by approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense - During the year ended December 31, 2015, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased compared to 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the assets acquired during 2014 and the Crestwood Merger in June 2013. For a further discussion of our acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nInterest and Debt Expense - Interest and debt expense, net increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013, primarily due to (i) the issuance of $700 million of 6.25% senior notes in March 2015; (ii) higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities; (iii) the assumption of $1.1 billion of long-term debt due to the Crestwood Merger in June 2013; and (iv) the issuance of $600 million of 6.125% senior notes in November 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were repayments of CEQP's credit facility in conjunction with the Simplification Merger, the redemption of Crestwood Midstream's 2019 Senior Notes and repayments of Crestwood Midstream's $1.0 billion credit facility.\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense (in millions):\n\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, credit facilities, debt issuances, and sales of common and preferred units. Our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements based on our successful execution of our strategy detailed in Outlook and Trends above.\nContemporaneously with the closing of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Midstream amended and restated its senior secured credit agreement to provide for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the CMLP Credit Facility), which expires in September 2020. On September 30, 2015, Crestwood Midstream borrowed approximately $720 million under the CMLP Credit Facility to (i) repay all borrowings outstanding under its $1.0 billion credit facility, (ii) fund a distribution to CEQP of approximately $378.3 million for purposes of repaying (or, if applicable, satisfying and discharging) substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and (iii) pay merger-related fees and expenses. As of December 31, 2015, Crestwood Midstream had $399.0 million of available capacity under its credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in its credit agreement. Crestwood Midstream also has approximately $1.8 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015, with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2023. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 8 for a more detailed discussion of the CMLP Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all our debt covenants related to the CMLP credit facility and CMLP senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the CMLP Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe our current liquidity sources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our future operating and capital requirements.\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\n\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows increased approximately $157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $169.7 million net cash inflow from working capital resulting primarily from lesser working capital requirements of our NGL terminalling, supply and logistics operations, primarily due to lower commodity prices. In addition, we experienced a $1,298.5 million decrease in operating revenues primarily from our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above, partially offset by lower costs of product/services sold of approximately $1,281.1 million primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices on our G&P and marketing, supply and logistics segments' operations described above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 our operating cash flows increased approximately $94.7 million compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to the Crestwood Merger and the acquisition of our Arrow operations which occurred in June 2013 and November 2013, respectively. These acquisitions contributed higher operating revenues of $2,504.6 million, partially offset by higher costs of product/services sold, operations and maintenance expense and general and administrative expense of approximately $2,268.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, our interest paid increased approximately $49.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities.\nInvesting Activities\nThe energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements. \nThe following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions). We have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flow and earnings.\n\n (1) Represents gross purchases of property, plant and equipment that are reimbursable by third parties. \nIn addition to the capital expenditures described in the table above, our cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the following significant items during the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nAcquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid approximately $19.5 million and $555.6 million to acquire our transportation fleet from Red Rock and LT Enterprises in 2014 and our Arrow assets in 2013. For a further discussion of these acquisitions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment. Our purchases of property, plant and equipment increased by approximately $77 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to organic growth projects placed in service related to our Marcellus assets.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired a 50% interest in Jackalope and a 50.01% interest in PRBIC for approximately $107.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we contributed approximately $42.0 million, $108.6 million and $21.5 million to our\nequity investments. For a further discussion of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nProceeds from the Sale of Tres Palacios. In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold its 100% interest in Tres Palacios to Tres Holdings, a newly formed joint venture between Crestwood Midstream's consolidated subsidiary and an affiliate of Brookfield for total cash consideration of approximately $132.8 million. As a result of this transaction, effective December 1, 2014, Crestwood Equity deconsolidated the operations of Tres Palacios. Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield paid approximately $66.4 million each to acquire their respective interests in Tres Palacios. For a further discussion of our sale in Tres Palacios, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nFinancing Activities\nSignificant items impacting our financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included the following:\nEquity Transactions\n \u2022 Increase in distributions to partners of approximately $69.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $34.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in the number of limited partner units outstanding; \n \u2022 Decrease in distributions to non-controlling partners of approximately $62.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the Simplification Merger and a $92.0 million increase in distributions to non-controlling partners in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the Crestwood Merger; \n \u2022 $58.8 million and $430.5 million net proceeds from the issuance of Crestwood Midstream's Class A Preferred Units in 2015 and 2014, respectively, prior to the completion of the Simplification Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CEQP issued 1,372,573 preferred units to its preferred unitholders in lieu of paying a quarterly cash distribution of $12.5 million, and CEQP has the option of continuing to issue preferred units to its preferred unitholders in lieu of paying cash distributions throughout 2016; \n \u2022 $53.9 million and $96.1 million net proceeds from the issuance of preferred security units to GE in 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $11.3 million of cash distributions on these units to GE, and no longer have the option to pay distributions by issuing additional preferred units to GE; \n \u2022 $129.0 million distribution to Crestwood Holdings for the acquisition of Legacy Crestwood's additional interest in Crestwood Marcellus Midstream LLC in 2013; and \n \u2022 $714.0 million net proceeds from the issuance of Crestwood Midstream's common units in 2013. \nDebt Transactions\n \u2022 $688.3 million net proceeds from Crestwood Midstream's issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes in 2015; \n \u2022 $363.6 million redemption of Crestwood Midstream's 2019 Senior Notes in 2015; \n \u2022 $332.8 million increase in net repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities in 2015 compared to 2014; and \n \u2022 $340.2 million decrease in net borrowings of long-term debt in 2014 compared to 2013. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are party to various contractual obligations. A portion of these obligations are reflected in our financial statements, such as long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, while other obligations, such as operating leases, capital commitments and contractual interest amounts are not reflected on our balance sheet. The following table and discussion summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in millions):\n\n (1) $735.0 million of our long-term debt is variable interest rate debt at prime rate or LIBOR plus an applicable spread. These rates plus their applicable spreads were between 2.70% and 5.00% at December 31, 2015. These rates have been applied for each period presented in the table. \n (2) See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 15 for a further discussion of these obligations. \n (3) Fixed price purchase commitments are volumetrically offset by third party fixed price sale contracts. \n (4) Primarily related to growth and maintenance contractual purchase obligations in our G&P segment, the development of a rail terminal project, certain upgrades to the US Salt facility, and environmental obligations included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet. Other contractual purchase obligations are defined as legally enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that have fixed or minimum quantities and fixed or minimum variable price provisions, and that detail approximate timing of the underlying obligations. \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future\ngrowth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCommodity prices have continued to decline since late 2014, and that decline has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2015 and 2014. The following table summarizes the goodwill of our various reporting units (in millions):\n\nThe goodwill impairments recorded during 2015 primarily resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the reporting units considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our customers. We utilized discount rates ranging from 10% to 16% to determine the fair value of our reporting units as of December 31, 2015.\nWe continue to monitor the remaining goodwill described in the table above, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. In particular, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses that recorded goodwill impairments in 2015 could have resulted in an additional $45 million and $55 million of goodwill impairments as of December 31, 2015, respectively. For more information about the market for our common equity, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nIn addition, a 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rate utilized to determine the fair value of our Northeast Storage and Transportation business could result in the fair value of that business falling below the carrying value of the business, which could result in a goodwill impairment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in that reporting unit. During 2015 and 2014, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\n \u2022 During 2015 and 2014, we incurred $8.5 million and $33.2 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Granite Wash gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our major customer of those assets has declared bankruptcy and has ceased any substantial drilling in the Granite Wash in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas and NGLs. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $593.3 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Barnett gathering and processing operations, which resulted from the recent actions of our primary customer in the Barnett Shale, Quicksilver, related to its filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2015. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $185.5 million of impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment related to our Fayetteville and Haynesville gathering and processing operations, which resulted from decreases in forecasted cash flows for those operations given that our customers for those assets have ceased any substantial drilling in the Fayetteville and Haynesville Shales in the near future given current and future anticipated market conditions related to natural gas. \n \u2022 During 2015, we incurred $31.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment related to our Watkins Glen marketing, supply and logistics segment development project, which resulted from continued delays and uncertainties in the permitting of our proposed NGL storage facility. \nOur other operations that incurred goodwill impairments during 2015 did not incur significant impairments on their long-lived assets based on our assessment that the undiscounted cash flows related to those assets exceeded their carrying value at December 31, 2015.\nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity-Method Investments\nWe acquired our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments in 2013, which required us to record the respective investments at fair value on the date they were acquired. We evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity-method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity-method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity-method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity-method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity-method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nBecause our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments were acquired in 2013, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these investments or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those investments from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the equity-method investment falling below their carrying value, and could result in an assessment of whether that investment is impaired.\nDuring 2015, we recorded a $51.4 million and $23.4 million impairment of our Jackalope and PRBIC equity-method investments, respectively, as a result of decreasing forecasted cash flows and increasing the discount rate utilized in determining the fair value of the equity-method investment considering the continued decrease in commodity prices and its impact on the midstream industry and our equity-method investments' customers.\nWe continue to monitor our equity-method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity-method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe gather, treat, compress, process, store, transport and sell various commodities pursuant to fixed-fee and percent-of-proceeds contracts. We recognize revenue on these contracts when certain criteria are met, the most important of which is that the delivery of the service has been performed. Certain of our contracts in our gathering and processing segment and storage and transportation segment contain minimum volume features under which the customers must deliver a set quantity of crude or gas or pay a deficiency fee based on the amount the customers' actual volume is short of the contractual minimum volume. The\nminimum volume feature generally allows customers a recoupment period in subsequent periods to make up certain previous volumetric shortfalls by delivering additional crude or gas above their minimum threshold. We recognize revenue from these contracts based on the physical volume that is delivered to our systems in the current period and any minimum volume deficiency amounts billable to customers under the minimum volume features are recorded as a deferred revenue liability until we determine that the revenue is earned. We will recognize the deferred revenue as income at such time as the customer does not have the physical ability to make up the deficiency due to system capacity limitations or the contractually allowed recoupment period expires. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had deferred revenue of approximately $14.2 million and $12.2 million, which is reflected as accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.", "item_7_tables": "Table 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition, results of operations, and future performance of a company and its subsidiaries in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). The report includes forward-looking statements about the company's liquidity, potential liabilities in legal proceedings, and the potential benefit of unconventional shale plays as supply basins. The company acknowledges that these forward-looking statements come with risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include the successful implementation of business plans, the impact of legislation, supply and demand influences, economic conditions, operating hazards, and market availability for asset sales or monetization, among others.\n\nThe company owns and operates midstream assets including crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and has conducted a Simplification Merger, restructuring its business into three segments: gathering and processing (G&P), storage and transportation, and marketing, supply and logistics. The merger involved various assets including integration of crude oil and NGL facilities, acquisitions, and business segment modifications.\n\nThe company's G&P operations focus on regions with significant shale plays in the U.S., like the Bakken, Marcellus, and Delaware Permian shales, among others. Their financial performance is linked to volume throughput, as well as various contract structures, including fixed-fee and percent-of-proceeds contracts, which mitigate commodity price exposure.\n\nThe storage and transportation segment includes natural gas storage facilities, transportation pipelines, and crude oil rail terminals, while the marketing, supply, and logistics segment deals with NGL supply, logistics business, and salt production.\n\nThe company's outlook suggests they are positioned to manage the impact of low commodity prices and have a focus on maximizing throughput and cost control to create long-term value for stakeholders. This includes potential strategic actions to de-risk and strengthen the company's investment profile.\n\nRegulatory matters are emphasized, with an expectation of continued oversight, especially in regions which have seen rapid production growth.\n\nThe financial performance of the company is evaluated based on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are significant indicators of operational performance. The report provides detailed reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, broken down by business segment.\n\nFinally, the company's contractual obligations, capital investments, potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, revenue recognition practices, and financing activities are discussed, providing insight into the company's obligations, investment profile, and how they account for certain critical aspects of their financial reporting."}
