This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 50 of this annual report.\nOverview\nHV Bancorp, Inc. provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and from our three additional full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have a loan production office located in Warminster, Pennsylvania and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, construction loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees and service charges on deposit accounts, gain from hedging instruments and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees, real estate owned and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our individual and business customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. Our core business strategies are to:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Continue to Originate and Sell Certain Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential mortgage lending has historically been a significant part of our business, and we recognize that originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans is essential to our status as a community-oriented bank. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we originated $168.0 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $179.3 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $5.5 million. Similarly, during the year ended June 30, 2016, we originated $161.7 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $157.8 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $4.1 million. We intend to continue to sell in the secondary market most of the long-term conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to increase non-interest income and manage the interest rate risk of our loan portfolio. We also intend to expand our portfolio of jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to increase interest income and help manage our interest rate risk. At June 30, 2017, we had $39.9 million in jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which represented 45.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio compared to $38.6 million or 53.6% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. We originate these loans internally through our relationships with real estate brokers and purchase loans through our relationships with certain mortgage originators. All purchased loans must comply with our underwriting standards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Increase Commercial Real Estate Lending. In order to increase the yield on our loan portfolio and reduce the term to repricing, we plan to increase our commercial real estate lending while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards. We will focus our commercial real estate lending on small businesses located in our market area, targeting owner-occupied businesses such as professional service providers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Maintain High Asset Quality. Strong asset quality is critical to the long-term financial success of a community bank. We attribute our high asset quality to maintaining conservative underwriting standards, the diligence of our loan collection personnel and the stability of the local economy. At June 30, 2017, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.65%. Because substantially all of our loans are secured by real estate, and the level of our non-performing loans has been low in recent years, we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Increase our Lower-Cost Core Deposits. NOW, passbook, checking and money market accounts are a lower cost source of funds than time deposits, and we have made a concerted effort to increase lower-cost transaction deposit accounts and reduce time deposits. Our ratio of core (non-time) deposits to total deposits has increased from 73.5% at June 30, 2016 to 83.6% at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. We plan to continue to aggressively market our core transaction accounts, emphasizing our high-quality service and competitive pricing of these products. We also offer the convenience of technology-based products, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking, mobile banking and mobile capture.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expand our banking franchise as opportunities arise through acquisitions of other financial institutions. We currently operate from four full service and one limited service banking offices. In order to grow our assets to mitigate the increasing costs of regulatory compliance, we intend to evaluate expansion opportunities, primarily through potential acquisitions of local financial institutions. We would seek to expand our presence in Montgomery, Bucks or Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania. However, we currently have no understandings or agreements with respect to acquiring any financial institution.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2015, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following represents our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.\nThese qualitative risk factors include:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred Tax Assets. We make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. We also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, no valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets were recorded.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, these assumptions require us to make judgments about future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we must estimate our taxable income in future years and the impact of tax planning strategies. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. Conversely, if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which we had established a valuation allowance would be realized, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nInvestment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nReal Estate Owned. Assets acquired through foreclosure consist of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors. Other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is determined using current market appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers, agreements of sale, and comparable market analyses from real estate brokers, where applicable. Changes in the fair value of assets acquired through foreclosure at future reporting dates or at the time of disposition will result in an adjustment to real estate owned and expense or sale of real estate owned, or net gain (loss) on sale of assets acquired through foreclosure, respectively.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 13 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All of our derivative instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and other liabilities. The fair value of our derivative instruments, other than Interest Rate Lock Commitments ( IRLC\u201d) is determined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities or third-party models utilizing observable market inputs. The fair value of the Company's IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying mortgage loan adjusted for the probability of such commitments being exercised and estimated costs to complete and originate the loan. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nTo be announced securities ( TBAs\u201d) are forward delivery\u201d securities considered derivative instruments under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance, (FASB ASC 815). We utilize TBAs to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments. TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from our approved counterparties. We utilize a third-party market pricing service, which compiles current prices for instruments from market sources and those prices represent the current executable price. TBAs are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition in mortgage derivatives and other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nLoan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and as other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as a gain in hedging instruments in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $34.8 million, or 19.1%, to $216.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $182.0 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increases of $18.3 million in loans receivable, which was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in residential one-to four family loans which was primarily from our new correspondent lending channel which originated loans of $9.7 million during 2017. In addition, investment securities increased by $15.5 million and cash and cash equivalents increased by $13.2 million during 2017 which was partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents increased $13.2 million, or 85.7%, to $28.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $15.4 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the proceeds received by the Company relating to the initial public offering of the Company, which has not yet fully been deployed into loans and securities. Additionally, an increase in deposits of $28.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) Advances of $11.0 million also contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2017.\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities increased by $15.5 million, or 39.6%, to $54.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $39.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $24.8 million in new securities, partially offset by sales and principal repayments of $9.0 million and an increase in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale of $176,000. At June 30, 2017, our held-to-maturity portion of the securities portfolio, at amortized cost, was $11.8 million, and our available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $42.8 million compared to held-to-maturity portion of $5.8 million and $33.3 million available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio at June 30, 2016.\nNet Loans\nNet loans increased $18.3 million, or 19.6%, to $111.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $93.5 million at June 30, 2016. One- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $16.6 million, or 23.1%, to $88.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $72.0 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of our continued strategic emphasis on growing our adjustable-rate jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased by $600,000 from $11.6 million at June 30, 2016 to $12.2 million at June 30, 2017. Construction loans decreased $1.2 million from $3.2 million at June 30, 2016 to $2.0 million at June 30, 2017. Home equity and HELOC loans decreased $900,000 to $5.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $6.4 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of borrower refinancing.\nLoans Held For Sale\nLoans held for sale decreased $11.9 million, or 48.2%, to $12.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $24.7 million at June 30, 2016 as the pipeline of one- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased during the year ended June 30, 2017 due to increases in interest rates resulting in lower demand.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased $28.7 million, or 20.3%, to $170.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $141.8 million at June 30, 2016. Our core deposits (consisting of NOW, money market, pass book and statement and checking accounts) increased by $38.3 million, or 36.7%, to $142.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $104.3 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. Offsetting the increase in core deposits was a decrease of $9.6 million, or 25.6% in certificates of deposit to $27.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $37.5 million at June 30, 2016 which was primarily due to the Bank's allowing higher costing certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks (through deposit listing services) to mature without renewing.\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased by $11.0 million from $20.0 million at June 30, 2016 to $9.0 million at June 30, 2017. The reduction was primarily due to scheduled maturities, which were not replaced due to managements deployment of funds resulting in the $28.7 million or 20.3% increase in deposits between June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017.\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $1.0 million, or 25.6%, to $2.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $3.9 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of a reduction in the underlying deposit balances, which are primarily held by title companies.\nTotal Shareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $18.4 million to $31.4 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $13.0 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the issuance of the Company's common stock from the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion which increased equity by $20.4 million in January 2017, and\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nnet income for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $569,000. These increases in consolidated shareholders' equity were partially offset by purchased ESOP shares of $2.4 million, established as part of the creation of the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan and other comprehensive losses of $104,000 due to the fair value adjustments, net of deferred tax, on the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $457,000 to $569,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in revenue associated with our mortgage banking activities. Our mortgage banking activities include (i) gains on loans held for sale, (ii) gains or losses from hedging instruments and (iii) changes in fair value of loans held for sale. Gains on loans held for sale increased by $1.4 million to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Losses from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale increased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. Changes in the fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000, to a loss of $578,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from a gain of $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net impact of these three components of our mortgage banking activities contributed to a decrease in non-interest income of $404,000 as total mortgage banking revenue decreased to $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe losses from hedging instruments included net gains and losses from derivative instruments on loan commitments for loans that will be held for sale. These gross gains or losses are recorded as (i) gains or losses on interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs\u201d), which reflects the value of the loan commitment at the time the loan is originated; (ii) subsequent gains or losses related to the change in value of the commitment, usually due to interest rate risk or price risk; and (iii) changes in the values of the to be announced ( TBA\u201d) securities that the Bank uses to protect against the price risk of the loan commitments. The recognition of gains/(losses) related to the hedging instruments for the year ended June 30, 2017 was recorded as a result of the IRLCs, the subsequent valuation adjustments of the loan commitments and changes in TBA valuations, which were $368,000, ($699,000) and ($6,000), respectively, and comprises the total loss from hedging instruments of ($337,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017. See note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the consolidated financial statements. Gains recorded from IRLCs decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $368,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily as the result of lower committed loans that were not closed during the 90 days prior to the year ended June 30, 2017 of $59.8 million compared to $74.2 million for 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase of full time equivalent employees from 65 at June 30, 2016 to 74 at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. The provision for loan losses increased $287,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of increased charge-offs of $129,000 and an increase in the general reserves as a result of increased loan volume. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the increases in salary expense and provision for loan losses were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $287,000 and lower other real estate owned expenses of $255,000.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income increased $432,000 or 8.1% to $5.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $5.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of an increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents, interest and fees on loans and investment securities.\nInterest income on cash and cash equivalents increased by $250,000 to $363,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $113,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in the average balances of cash and cash-equivalents of $21.6 million, which increased to $37.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $16.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Interest earning cash and cash equivalents increased primarily as a result of the stock offering proceeds of $21.4 million related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization. Additionally, the average yield on cash and cash equivalents increased 26 basis points, to 96 basis points for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 70\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nbasis points for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to recent rate increases in the Federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Bank during 2017.\nInterest and fees on loans increased $77,000 to $4.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.4 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding of $10.1 million, which increased to $110.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $100.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average balance of one-to-four family residential loans. The benefit from the higher loan volume was partially offset by a reduction in average yield of 34 basis points, which decreased to 4.10% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.44% for 2016.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $87,000 or 12.2% to $802,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $715,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest income on U.S. Government Agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal securities and restricted bank stock which increased $206,000 or 56.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities and collateral mortgage obligation (CMO) securities of $101,000 or 26.9%, which decreased to $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $375,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The average yield on total securities increased 9 basis points to 1.86% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.77% for 2016, as market rates increased slightly. A portion of the conversion proceeds were used to purchase investment securities, which caused the average balance of investment securities to increase by $2.8 million to $43.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $40.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $145,000, or 19.4%, to $891,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $746,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to a $92,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a $53,000 increase in interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $92,000, or 14.2%, to $741,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $649,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $19.5 million to $153.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $133.9 million for 2016, primarily as a result of a $24.3 million increase in the average balance of our core deposit accounts, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the average balance of our certificates of deposit. The increase in the average balance of core deposits was primarily the result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. The average cost of deposits was unchanged at 48 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The rates paid on NOW accounts and money market deposits increased by 35 basis points and eight basis points, respectively. Rates on NOW accounts increased due to the Bank creating a higher tier NOW account product for the purposes of attracting deposits from professionals who maintain escrow or other fiduciary accounts on behalf of their clients. This product can pay up to 1.00% on interest per annum. The average cost of certificates of deposit decreased by ten basis points to 1.00% during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 1.10% for the year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting runoff of higher priced certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks.\nInterest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $53,000 to $147,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $94,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which increased $5.4 million to $14.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest expense on advances was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which decreased from 1.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 to 1.03% for the year ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in average cost was due to decreased rates on advances.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $287,000 to $4.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $4.6 million the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in net interest-earning assets which increased to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $12.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. This increase in net interest-earning assets was primarily the result of the stock offering proceeds related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization during the year ended June 30, 2017. Our interest rate spread decreased 39 basis points to 2.46% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.85% for the year ended June 30, 2016. Our net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 2.52% for\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 as the increase in average interest earning assets occurred primarily in the lower yielding interest earning cash and cash equivalents.\nAverage Balances and Yields.

Loan Losses\nWe establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nThis evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by $192,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as the result of a home equity loan charge-off of $125,000 and an increase in loans outstanding of $18.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2017, total charge-offs of $129,000 were recorded and $34,000 of recoveries were received. During the year ended June 30, 2016, total charge-offs of $37,000 were recorded and $1,000 of recoveries were received.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income decreased $416,000, or 7.8% to $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the income from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale portfolio which decreased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to the less favorable interest rate environments and decreased volume of locked loans associated with hedging. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. These two decreases in non-interest income were partially offset by an increase in the gain on loans held for sale of $1.4 million, which increased to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The offset to the gains incurred from the hedging instruments is realized in the increased value of the loan when it is committed to the investor in the secondary market, and is therefore realized upon the sale of the loan.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $466,000, or 5.6%, to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflected increases in salaries and benefits of $352,000 and increases of $301,000 in professional fees and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate owned expenses of $255,000 during the same years.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.7 million for year ended June 30, 2016. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to seventy-four FTEs as of June 30, 2017, from sixty-one FTEs as of June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. Professional fees increased to $698,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $561,000 for 2016, and other expenses increased to $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.2 million for 2016. The increase in both professional fees and other expenses during the year ended June 30, 2017 was primarily a result of additional professional fees of $95,000 as a result of ongoing compliance associated with being a public company as well as consulting fees of $77,000 for investing in rebranding of the Bank as part of our growth plan. Real estate owned expense decreased $255,000, or 93.1%, to $19,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to reductions in write-downs on real estate owned. Other real estate owned was $0 at June 30, 2017 and $115,000 at June 30, 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $195,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $525,000 for 2016. Federal income taxes included in total taxes for the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $147,000 and $417,000, respectively, with effective federal tax rates of 20.6% and 28.9%, respectively. Due to the increase in municipal tax free bonds during the year ended June 30, 2017,federal income tax expense was reduced which caused a lower effective federal tax rate for 2017 when compared to 2016.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, Pennsylvania state tax was $48,000 and $108,000, respectively, with effective rates of 6.2% and 6.9%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $9.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of $58.4 million as of June 30, 2017. Additionally, at June 30, 2017, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit equal to 95% of the fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was $2.4 million at June 30, 2017. We have not\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nborrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of June 30, 2017.\nWe monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.6 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $42.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.7 million and ($6.2) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Net cash (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was ($34.3) million and ($6.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, we sold $4.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities was $34.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $28.7 million, net proceeds of $20.4 million for the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the initial public offering, partially offset by net repayments of $11.0 million for borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of June 30, 2017, totaled $11.5 million, or 6.7%, of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nCapital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At June 30, 2017, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At June 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $22.0 million, unused lines of credit totaling $8.0 million and no stand-by letters of credit outstanding. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from June 30, 2017 totaled $11.5 million. Management expects that a substantial\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nportion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at June 30, 2017 and 2016 and our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 50 of this annual report.\nOverview\nHV Bancorp, Inc. provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and from our three additional full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have a loan production office located in Warminster, Pennsylvania and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, construction loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees and service charges on deposit accounts, gain from hedging instruments and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees, real estate owned and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our individual and business customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. Our core business strategies are to:\n \u2022 Continue to Originate and Sell Certain Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential mortgage lending has historically been a significant part of our business, and we recognize that originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans is essential to our status as a community-oriented bank. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we originated $168.0 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $179.3 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $5.5 million. Similarly, during the year ended June 30, 2016, we originated $161.7 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $157.8 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $4.1 million. We intend to continue to sell in the secondary market most of the long-term conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to increase non-interest income and manage the interest rate risk of our loan portfolio. We also intend to expand our portfolio of jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to increase interest income and help manage our interest rate risk. At June 30, 2017, we had $39.9 million in jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which represented 45.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio compared to $38.6 million or 53.6% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. We originate these loans internally through our relationships with real estate brokers and purchase loans through our relationships with certain mortgage originators. All purchased loans must comply with our underwriting standards. \n \n \u2022 Increase Commercial Real Estate Lending. In order to increase the yield on our loan portfolio and reduce the term to repricing, we plan to increase our commercial real estate lending while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards. We will focus our commercial real estate lending on small businesses located in our market area, targeting owner-occupied businesses such as professional service providers. \n \u2022 Maintain High Asset Quality. Strong asset quality is critical to the long-term financial success of a community bank. We attribute our high asset quality to maintaining conservative underwriting standards, the diligence of our loan collection personnel and the stability of the local economy. At June 30, 2017, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.65%. Because substantially all of our loans are secured by real estate, and the level of our non-performing loans has been low in recent years, we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Increase our Lower-Cost Core Deposits. NOW, passbook, checking and money market accounts are a lower cost source of funds than time deposits, and we have made a concerted effort to increase lower-cost transaction deposit accounts and reduce time deposits. Our ratio of core (non-time) deposits to total deposits has increased from 73.5% at June 30, 2016 to 83.6% at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. We plan to continue to aggressively market our core transaction accounts, emphasizing our high-quality service and competitive pricing of these products. We also offer the convenience of technology-based products, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking, mobile banking and mobile capture. \n \u2022 Expand our banking franchise as opportunities arise through acquisitions of other financial institutions. We currently operate from four full service and one limited service banking offices. In order to grow our assets to mitigate the increasing costs of regulatory compliance, we intend to evaluate expansion opportunities, primarily through potential acquisitions of local financial institutions. We would seek to expand our presence in Montgomery, Bucks or Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania. However, we currently have no understandings or agreements with respect to acquiring any financial institution. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2015, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\n \nThe following represents our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.\nThese qualitative risk factors include:\n \u2022 Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; \n \u2022 National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; \n \u2022 Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; \n \u2022 Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications; \n \u2022 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and \n \u2022 Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. \nAlthough we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\n \nDeferred Tax Assets. We make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. We also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, no valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets were recorded.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, these assumptions require us to make judgments about future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we must estimate our taxable income in future years and the impact of tax planning strategies. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. Conversely, if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which we had established a valuation allowance would be realized, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nInvestment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nReal Estate Owned. Assets acquired through foreclosure consist of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors. Other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is determined using current market appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers, agreements of sale, and comparable market analyses from real estate brokers, where applicable. Changes in the fair value of assets acquired through foreclosure at future reporting dates or at the time of disposition will result in an adjustment to real estate owned and expense or sale of real estate owned, or net gain (loss) on sale of assets acquired through foreclosure, respectively.\n \nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 13 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All of our derivative instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and other liabilities. The fair value of our derivative instruments, other than Interest Rate Lock Commitments ( IRLC\u201d) is determined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities or third-party models utilizing observable market inputs. The fair value of the Company's IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying mortgage loan adjusted for the probability of such commitments being exercised and estimated costs to complete and originate the loan. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nTo be announced securities ( TBAs\u201d) are forward delivery\u201d securities considered derivative instruments under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance, (FASB ASC 815). We utilize TBAs to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments. TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from our approved counterparties. We utilize a third-party market pricing service, which compiles current prices for instruments from market sources and those prices represent the current executable price. TBAs are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition in mortgage derivatives and other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nLoan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and as other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as a gain in hedging instruments in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $34.8 million, or 19.1%, to $216.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $182.0 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increases of $18.3 million in loans receivable, which was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in residential one-to four family loans which was primarily from our new correspondent lending channel which originated loans of $9.7 million during 2017. In addition, investment securities increased by $15.5 million and cash and cash equivalents increased by $13.2 million during 2017 which was partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents increased $13.2 million, or 85.7%, to $28.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $15.4 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the proceeds received by the Company relating to the initial public offering of the Company, which has not yet fully been deployed into loans and securities. Additionally, an increase in deposits of $28.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) Advances of $11.0 million also contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2017.\n \nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities increased by $15.5 million, or 39.6%, to $54.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $39.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $24.8 million in new securities, partially offset by sales and principal repayments of $9.0 million and an increase in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale of $176,000. At June 30, 2017, our held-to-maturity portion of the securities portfolio, at amortized cost, was $11.8 million, and our available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $42.8 million compared to held-to-maturity portion of $5.8 million and $33.3 million available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio at June 30, 2016.\nNet Loans\nNet loans increased $18.3 million, or 19.6%, to $111.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $93.5 million at June 30, 2016. One- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $16.6 million, or 23.1%, to $88.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $72.0 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of our continued strategic emphasis on growing our adjustable-rate jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased by $600,000 from $11.6 million at June 30, 2016 to $12.2 million at June 30, 2017. Construction loans decreased $1.2 million from $3.2 million at June 30, 2016 to $2.0 million at June 30, 2017. Home equity and HELOC loans decreased $900,000 to $5.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $6.4 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of borrower refinancing.\nLoans Held For Sale\nLoans held for sale decreased $11.9 million, or 48.2%, to $12.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $24.7 million at June 30, 2016 as the pipeline of one- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased during the year ended June 30, 2017 due to increases in interest rates resulting in lower demand.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased $28.7 million, or 20.3%, to $170.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $141.8 million at June 30, 2016. Our core deposits (consisting of NOW, money market, pass book and statement and checking accounts) increased by $38.3 million, or 36.7%, to $142.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $104.3 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. Offsetting the increase in core deposits was a decrease of $9.6 million, or 25.6% in certificates of deposit to $27.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $37.5 million at June 30, 2016 which was primarily due to the Bank's allowing higher costing certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks (through deposit listing services) to mature without renewing.\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased by $11.0 million from $20.0 million at June 30, 2016 to $9.0 million at June 30, 2017. The reduction was primarily due to scheduled maturities, which were not replaced due to managements deployment of funds resulting in the $28.7 million or 20.3% increase in deposits between June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017.\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $1.0 million, or 25.6%, to $2.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $3.9 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of a reduction in the underlying deposit balances, which are primarily held by title companies.\nTotal Shareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $18.4 million to $31.4 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $13.0 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the issuance of the Company's common stock from the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion which increased equity by $20.4 million in January 2017, and\n \nnet income for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $569,000. These increases in consolidated shareholders' equity were partially offset by purchased ESOP shares of $2.4 million, established as part of the creation of the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan and other comprehensive losses of $104,000 due to the fair value adjustments, net of deferred tax, on the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $457,000 to $569,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in revenue associated with our mortgage banking activities. Our mortgage banking activities include (i) gains on loans held for sale, (ii) gains or losses from hedging instruments and (iii) changes in fair value of loans held for sale. Gains on loans held for sale increased by $1.4 million to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Losses from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale increased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. Changes in the fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000, to a loss of $578,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from a gain of $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net impact of these three components of our mortgage banking activities contributed to a decrease in non-interest income of $404,000 as total mortgage banking revenue decreased to $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe losses from hedging instruments included net gains and losses from derivative instruments on loan commitments for loans that will be held for sale. These gross gains or losses are recorded as (i) gains or losses on interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs\u201d), which reflects the value of the loan commitment at the time the loan is originated; (ii) subsequent gains or losses related to the change in value of the commitment, usually due to interest rate risk or price risk; and (iii) changes in the values of the to be announced ( TBA\u201d) securities that the Bank uses to protect against the price risk of the loan commitments. The recognition of gains/(losses) related to the hedging instruments for the year ended June 30, 2017 was recorded as a result of the IRLCs, the subsequent valuation adjustments of the loan commitments and changes in TBA valuations, which were $368,000, ($699,000) and ($6,000), respectively, and comprises the total loss from hedging instruments of ($337,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017. See note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the consolidated financial statements. Gains recorded from IRLCs decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $368,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily as the result of lower committed loans that were not closed during the 90 days prior to the year ended June 30, 2017 of $59.8 million compared to $74.2 million for 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase of full time equivalent employees from 65 at June 30, 2016 to 74 at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. The provision for loan losses increased $287,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of increased charge-offs of $129,000 and an increase in the general reserves as a result of increased loan volume. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the increases in salary expense and provision for loan losses were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $287,000 and lower other real estate owned expenses of $255,000.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income increased $432,000 or 8.1% to $5.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $5.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of an increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents, interest and fees on loans and investment securities.\nInterest income on cash and cash equivalents increased by $250,000 to $363,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $113,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in the average balances of cash and cash-equivalents of $21.6 million, which increased to $37.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $16.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Interest earning cash and cash equivalents increased primarily as a result of the stock offering proceeds of $21.4 million related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization. Additionally, the average yield on cash and cash equivalents increased 26 basis points, to 96 basis points for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 70\n \nbasis points for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to recent rate increases in the Federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Bank during 2017.\nInterest and fees on loans increased $77,000 to $4.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.4 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding of $10.1 million, which increased to $110.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $100.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average balance of one-to-four family residential loans. The benefit from the higher loan volume was partially offset by a reduction in average yield of 34 basis points, which decreased to 4.10% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.44% for 2016.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $87,000 or 12.2% to $802,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $715,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest income on U.S. Government Agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal securities and restricted bank stock which increased $206,000 or 56.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities and collateral mortgage obligation (CMO) securities of $101,000 or 26.9%, which decreased to $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $375,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The average yield on total securities increased 9 basis points to 1.86% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.77% for 2016, as market rates increased slightly. A portion of the conversion proceeds were used to purchase investment securities, which caused the average balance of investment securities to increase by $2.8 million to $43.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $40.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $145,000, or 19.4%, to $891,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $746,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to a $92,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a $53,000 increase in interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $92,000, or 14.2%, to $741,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $649,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $19.5 million to $153.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $133.9 million for 2016, primarily as a result of a $24.3 million increase in the average balance of our core deposit accounts, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the average balance of our certificates of deposit. The increase in the average balance of core deposits was primarily the result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. The average cost of deposits was unchanged at 48 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The rates paid on NOW accounts and money market deposits increased by 35 basis points and eight basis points, respectively. Rates on NOW accounts increased due to the Bank creating a higher tier NOW account product for the purposes of attracting deposits from professionals who maintain escrow or other fiduciary accounts on behalf of their clients. This product can pay up to 1.00% on interest per annum. The average cost of certificates of deposit decreased by ten basis points to 1.00% during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 1.10% for the year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting runoff of higher priced certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks.\nInterest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $53,000 to $147,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $94,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which increased $5.4 million to $14.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest expense on advances was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which decreased from 1.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 to 1.03% for the year ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in average cost was due to decreased rates on advances.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $287,000 to $4.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $4.6 million the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in net interest-earning assets which increased to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $12.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. This increase in net interest-earning assets was primarily the result of the stock offering proceeds related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization during the year ended June 30, 2017. Our interest rate spread decreased 39 basis points to 2.46% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.85% for the year ended June 30, 2016. Our net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 2.52% for\n \nthe year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 as the increase in average interest earning assets occurred primarily in the lower yielding interest earning cash and cash equivalents.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nJune 30, 2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nJune 30, 2016 vs 2015\n</td>

Loan Losses\nWe establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nThis evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by $192,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as the result of a home equity loan charge-off of $125,000 and an increase in loans outstanding of $18.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2017, total charge-offs of $129,000 were recorded and $34,000 of recoveries were received. During the year ended June 30, 2016, total charge-offs of $37,000 were recorded and $1,000 of recoveries were received.\n \nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income decreased $416,000, or 7.8% to $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the income from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale portfolio which decreased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to the less favorable interest rate environments and decreased volume of locked loans associated with hedging. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. These two decreases in non-interest income were partially offset by an increase in the gain on loans held for sale of $1.4 million, which increased to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The offset to the gains incurred from the hedging instruments is realized in the increased value of the loan when it is committed to the investor in the secondary market, and is therefore realized upon the sale of the loan.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $466,000, or 5.6%, to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflected increases in salaries and benefits of $352,000 and increases of $301,000 in professional fees and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate owned expenses of $255,000 during the same years.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.7 million for year ended June 30, 2016. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to seventy-four FTEs as of June 30, 2017, from sixty-one FTEs as of June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. Professional fees increased to $698,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $561,000 for 2016, and other expenses increased to $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.2 million for 2016. The increase in both professional fees and other expenses during the year ended June 30, 2017 was primarily a result of additional professional fees of $95,000 as a result of ongoing compliance associated with being a public company as well as consulting fees of $77,000 for investing in rebranding of the Bank as part of our growth plan. Real estate owned expense decreased $255,000, or 93.1%, to $19,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to reductions in write-downs on real estate owned. Other real estate owned was $0 at June 30, 2017 and $115,000 at June 30, 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $195,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $525,000 for 2016. Federal income taxes included in total taxes for the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $147,000 and $417,000, respectively, with effective federal tax rates of 20.6% and 28.9%, respectively. Due to the increase in municipal tax free bonds during the year ended June 30, 2017,federal income tax expense was reduced which caused a lower effective federal tax rate for 2017 when compared to 2016.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, Pennsylvania state tax was $48,000 and $108,000, respectively, with effective rates of 6.2% and 6.9%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $9.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of $58.4 million as of June 30, 2017. Additionally, at June 30, 2017, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit equal to 95% of the fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was $2.4 million at June 30, 2017. We have not\n \nborrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of June 30, 2017.\nWe monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.6 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $42.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.7 million and ($6.2) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Net cash (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was ($34.3) million and ($6.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, we sold $4.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities was $34.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $28.7 million, net proceeds of $20.4 million for the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the initial public offering, partially offset by net repayments of $11.0 million for borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of June 30, 2017, totaled $11.5 million, or 6.7%, of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nCapital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At June 30, 2017, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At June 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $22.0 million, unused lines of credit totaling $8.0 million and no stand-by letters of credit outstanding. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from June 30, 2017 totaled $11.5 million. Management expects that a substantial\n \nportion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at June 30, 2017 and 2016 and our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 50 of this annual report.\nOverview\nHV Bancorp, Inc. provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and from our three additional full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have a loan production office located in Warminster, Pennsylvania and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, construction loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees and service charges on deposit accounts, gain from hedging instruments and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees, real estate owned and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our individual and business customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. Our core business strategies are to:\n \u2022 Continue to Originate and Sell Certain Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential mortgage lending has historically been a significant part of our business, and we recognize that originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans is essential to our status as a community-oriented bank. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we originated $168.0 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $179.3 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $5.5 million. Similarly, during the year ended June 30, 2016, we originated $161.7 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $157.8 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $4.1 million. We intend to continue to sell in the secondary market most of the long-term conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to increase non-interest income and manage the interest rate risk of our loan portfolio. We also intend to expand our portfolio of jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to increase interest income and help manage our interest rate risk. At June 30, 2017, we had $39.9 million in jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which represented 45.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio compared to $38.6 million or 53.6% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. We originate these loans internally through our relationships with real estate brokers and purchase loans through our relationships with certain mortgage originators. All purchased loans must comply with our underwriting standards. \n \n \u2022 Increase Commercial Real Estate Lending. In order to increase the yield on our loan portfolio and reduce the term to repricing, we plan to increase our commercial real estate lending while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards. We will focus our commercial real estate lending on small businesses located in our market area, targeting owner-occupied businesses such as professional service providers. \n \u2022 Maintain High Asset Quality. Strong asset quality is critical to the long-term financial success of a community bank. We attribute our high asset quality to maintaining conservative underwriting standards, the diligence of our loan collection personnel and the stability of the local economy. At June 30, 2017, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.65%. Because substantially all of our loans are secured by real estate, and the level of our non-performing loans has been low in recent years, we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Increase our Lower-Cost Core Deposits. NOW, passbook, checking and money market accounts are a lower cost source of funds than time deposits, and we have made a concerted effort to increase lower-cost transaction deposit accounts and reduce time deposits. Our ratio of core (non-time) deposits to total deposits has increased from 73.5% at June 30, 2016 to 83.6% at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. We plan to continue to aggressively market our core transaction accounts, emphasizing our high-quality service and competitive pricing of these products. We also offer the convenience of technology-based products, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking, mobile banking and mobile capture. \n \u2022 Expand our banking franchise as opportunities arise through acquisitions of other financial institutions. We currently operate from four full service and one limited service banking offices. In order to grow our assets to mitigate the increasing costs of regulatory compliance, we intend to evaluate expansion opportunities, primarily through potential acquisitions of local financial institutions. We would seek to expand our presence in Montgomery, Bucks or Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania. However, we currently have no understandings or agreements with respect to acquiring any financial institution. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2015, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\n \nThe following represents our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.\nThese qualitative risk factors include:\n \u2022 Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; \n \u2022 National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; \n \u2022 Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; \n \u2022 Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications; \n \u2022 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and \n \u2022 Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. \nAlthough we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\n \nDeferred Tax Assets. We make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. We also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, no valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets were recorded.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, these assumptions require us to make judgments about future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we must estimate our taxable income in future years and the impact of tax planning strategies. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. Conversely, if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which we had established a valuation allowance would be realized, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded.\nSee Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nInvestment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term other-than-temporary\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nReal Estate Owned. Assets acquired through foreclosure consist of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors. Other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of other real estate owned is determined using current market appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers, agreements of sale, and comparable market analyses from real estate brokers, where applicable. Changes in the fair value of assets acquired through foreclosure at future reporting dates or at the time of disposition will result in an adjustment to real estate owned and expense or sale of real estate owned, or net gain (loss) on sale of assets acquired through foreclosure, respectively.\n \nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 13 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All of our derivative instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and other liabilities. The fair value of our derivative instruments, other than Interest Rate Lock Commitments ( IRLC\u201d) is determined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities or third-party models utilizing observable market inputs. The fair value of the Company's IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying mortgage loan adjusted for the probability of such commitments being exercised and estimated costs to complete and originate the loan. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nTo be announced securities ( TBAs\u201d) are forward delivery\u201d securities considered derivative instruments under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance, (FASB ASC 815). We utilize TBAs to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments. TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from our approved counterparties. We utilize a third-party market pricing service, which compiles current prices for instruments from market sources and those prices represent the current executable price. TBAs are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition in mortgage derivatives and other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nLoan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and as other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as a gain in hedging instruments in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $34.8 million, or 19.1%, to $216.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $182.0 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increases of $18.3 million in loans receivable, which was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in residential one-to four family loans which was primarily from our new correspondent lending channel which originated loans of $9.7 million during 2017. In addition, investment securities increased by $15.5 million and cash and cash equivalents increased by $13.2 million during 2017 which was partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents increased $13.2 million, or 85.7%, to $28.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $15.4 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the proceeds received by the Company relating to the initial public offering of the Company, which has not yet fully been deployed into loans and securities. Additionally, an increase in deposits of $28.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) Advances of $11.0 million also contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2017.\n \nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities increased by $15.5 million, or 39.6%, to $54.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $39.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $24.8 million in new securities, partially offset by sales and principal repayments of $9.0 million and an increase in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale of $176,000. At June 30, 2017, our held-to-maturity portion of the securities portfolio, at amortized cost, was $11.8 million, and our available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $42.8 million compared to held-to-maturity portion of $5.8 million and $33.3 million available-for-sale portion of the securities portfolio at June 30, 2016.\nNet Loans\nNet loans increased $18.3 million, or 19.6%, to $111.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $93.5 million at June 30, 2016. One- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $16.6 million, or 23.1%, to $88.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $72.0 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of our continued strategic emphasis on growing our adjustable-rate jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased by $600,000 from $11.6 million at June 30, 2016 to $12.2 million at June 30, 2017. Construction loans decreased $1.2 million from $3.2 million at June 30, 2016 to $2.0 million at June 30, 2017. Home equity and HELOC loans decreased $900,000 to $5.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $6.4 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of borrower refinancing.\nLoans Held For Sale\nLoans held for sale decreased $11.9 million, or 48.2%, to $12.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $24.7 million at June 30, 2016 as the pipeline of one- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased during the year ended June 30, 2017 due to increases in interest rates resulting in lower demand.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased $28.7 million, or 20.3%, to $170.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $141.8 million at June 30, 2016. Our core deposits (consisting of NOW, money market, pass book and statement and checking accounts) increased by $38.3 million, or 36.7%, to $142.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $104.3 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. Offsetting the increase in core deposits was a decrease of $9.6 million, or 25.6% in certificates of deposit to $27.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $37.5 million at June 30, 2016 which was primarily due to the Bank's allowing higher costing certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks (through deposit listing services) to mature without renewing.\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased by $11.0 million from $20.0 million at June 30, 2016 to $9.0 million at June 30, 2017. The reduction was primarily due to scheduled maturities, which were not replaced due to managements deployment of funds resulting in the $28.7 million or 20.3% increase in deposits between June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017.\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $1.0 million, or 25.6%, to $2.9 million at June 30, 2017 from $3.9 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of a reduction in the underlying deposit balances, which are primarily held by title companies.\nTotal Shareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $18.4 million to $31.4 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $13.0 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the issuance of the Company's common stock from the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion which increased equity by $20.4 million in January 2017, and\n \nnet income for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $569,000. These increases in consolidated shareholders' equity were partially offset by purchased ESOP shares of $2.4 million, established as part of the creation of the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan and other comprehensive losses of $104,000 due to the fair value adjustments, net of deferred tax, on the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $457,000 to $569,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in revenue associated with our mortgage banking activities. Our mortgage banking activities include (i) gains on loans held for sale, (ii) gains or losses from hedging instruments and (iii) changes in fair value of loans held for sale. Gains on loans held for sale increased by $1.4 million to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Losses from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale increased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. Changes in the fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000, to a loss of $578,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from a gain of $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net impact of these three components of our mortgage banking activities contributed to a decrease in non-interest income of $404,000 as total mortgage banking revenue decreased to $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe losses from hedging instruments included net gains and losses from derivative instruments on loan commitments for loans that will be held for sale. These gross gains or losses are recorded as (i) gains or losses on interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs\u201d), which reflects the value of the loan commitment at the time the loan is originated; (ii) subsequent gains or losses related to the change in value of the commitment, usually due to interest rate risk or price risk; and (iii) changes in the values of the to be announced ( TBA\u201d) securities that the Bank uses to protect against the price risk of the loan commitments. The recognition of gains/(losses) related to the hedging instruments for the year ended June 30, 2017 was recorded as a result of the IRLCs, the subsequent valuation adjustments of the loan commitments and changes in TBA valuations, which were $368,000, ($699,000) and ($6,000), respectively, and comprises the total loss from hedging instruments of ($337,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017. See note 9 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the consolidated financial statements. Gains recorded from IRLCs decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $368,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily as the result of lower committed loans that were not closed during the 90 days prior to the year ended June 30, 2017 of $59.8 million compared to $74.2 million for 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase of full time equivalent employees from 65 at June 30, 2016 to 74 at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. The provision for loan losses increased $287,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of increased charge-offs of $129,000 and an increase in the general reserves as a result of increased loan volume. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the increases in salary expense and provision for loan losses were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $287,000 and lower other real estate owned expenses of $255,000.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income increased $432,000 or 8.1% to $5.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $5.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of an increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents, interest and fees on loans and investment securities.\nInterest income on cash and cash equivalents increased by $250,000 to $363,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $113,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in the average balances of cash and cash-equivalents of $21.6 million, which increased to $37.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $16.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Interest earning cash and cash equivalents increased primarily as a result of the stock offering proceeds of $21.4 million related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization. Additionally, the average yield on cash and cash equivalents increased 26 basis points, to 96 basis points for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 70\n \nbasis points for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to recent rate increases in the Federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Bank during 2017.\nInterest and fees on loans increased $77,000 to $4.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.4 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding of $10.1 million, which increased to $110.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $100.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average balance of one-to-four family residential loans. The benefit from the higher loan volume was partially offset by a reduction in average yield of 34 basis points, which decreased to 4.10% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.44% for 2016.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $87,000 or 12.2% to $802,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $715,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest income on U.S. Government Agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal securities and restricted bank stock which increased $206,000 or 56.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities and collateral mortgage obligation (CMO) securities of $101,000 or 26.9%, which decreased to $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $375,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The average yield on total securities increased 9 basis points to 1.86% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.77% for 2016, as market rates increased slightly. A portion of the conversion proceeds were used to purchase investment securities, which caused the average balance of investment securities to increase by $2.8 million to $43.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $40.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $145,000, or 19.4%, to $891,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $746,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, due to a $92,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a $53,000 increase in interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $92,000, or 14.2%, to $741,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $649,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $19.5 million to $153.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $133.9 million for 2016, primarily as a result of a $24.3 million increase in the average balance of our core deposit accounts, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the average balance of our certificates of deposit. The increase in the average balance of core deposits was primarily the result of the introduction of a new demand product attracting clients of local professional firms such as CPA firms, totaling $23.3 million at June 30, 2017. The average cost of deposits was unchanged at 48 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The rates paid on NOW accounts and money market deposits increased by 35 basis points and eight basis points, respectively. Rates on NOW accounts increased due to the Bank creating a higher tier NOW account product for the purposes of attracting deposits from professionals who maintain escrow or other fiduciary accounts on behalf of their clients. This product can pay up to 1.00% on interest per annum. The average cost of certificates of deposit decreased by ten basis points to 1.00% during the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 1.10% for the year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting runoff of higher priced certificates of deposit held by credit unions and banks.\nInterest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $53,000 to $147,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $94,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in the average Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which increased $5.4 million to $14.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest expense on advances was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which decreased from 1.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 to 1.03% for the year ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in average cost was due to decreased rates on advances.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $287,000 to $4.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $4.6 million the year ended June 30, 2016 as a result of an increase in net interest-earning assets which increased to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $12.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. This increase in net interest-earning assets was primarily the result of the stock offering proceeds related to the Company's initial public offering and the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization during the year ended June 30, 2017. Our interest rate spread decreased 39 basis points to 2.46% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.85% for the year ended June 30, 2016. Our net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 2.52% for\n \nthe year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 as the increase in average interest earning assets occurred primarily in the lower yielding interest earning cash and cash equivalents.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\n\n (1) Includes loans held for sale. \n (2) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on average interest-earning assets and the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. \n \n (3) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. \n \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nThis evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by $192,000 to $201,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $9,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily as the result of a home equity loan charge-off of $125,000 and an increase in loans outstanding of $18.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2017, total charge-offs of $129,000 were recorded and $34,000 of recoveries were received. During the year ended June 30, 2016, total charge-offs of $37,000 were recorded and $1,000 of recoveries were received.\n \nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income decreased $416,000, or 7.8% to $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the income from hedging instruments associated with the loans held for sale portfolio which decreased by $841,000, to a loss of $337,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, from a gain of $504,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to the less favorable interest rate environments and decreased volume of locked loans associated with hedging. Additionally, the change in fair value of loans held for sale decreased by $962,000 to ($578,000) for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $384,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. These two decreases in non-interest income were partially offset by an increase in the gain on loans held for sale of $1.4 million, which increased to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The offset to the gains incurred from the hedging instruments is realized in the increased value of the loan when it is committed to the investor in the secondary market, and is therefore realized upon the sale of the loan.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $466,000, or 5.6%, to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflected increases in salaries and benefits of $352,000 and increases of $301,000 in professional fees and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate owned expenses of $255,000 during the same years.\nSalary expense increased by $352,000 to $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.7 million for year ended June 30, 2016. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to seventy-four FTEs as of June 30, 2017, from sixty-one FTEs as of June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the expansion in our mortgage loan department. Professional fees increased to $698,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $561,000 for 2016, and other expenses increased to $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.2 million for 2016. The increase in both professional fees and other expenses during the year ended June 30, 2017 was primarily a result of additional professional fees of $95,000 as a result of ongoing compliance associated with being a public company as well as consulting fees of $77,000 for investing in rebranding of the Bank as part of our growth plan. Real estate owned expense decreased $255,000, or 93.1%, to $19,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $274,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to reductions in write-downs on real estate owned. Other real estate owned was $0 at June 30, 2017 and $115,000 at June 30, 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $195,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $525,000 for 2016. Federal income taxes included in total taxes for the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $147,000 and $417,000, respectively, with effective federal tax rates of 20.6% and 28.9%, respectively. Due to the increase in municipal tax free bonds during the year ended June 30, 2017,federal income tax expense was reduced which caused a lower effective federal tax rate for 2017 when compared to 2016.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, Pennsylvania state tax was $48,000 and $108,000, respectively, with effective rates of 6.2% and 6.9%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Management. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $9.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of $58.4 million as of June 30, 2017. Additionally, at June 30, 2017, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit equal to 95% of the fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was $2.4 million at June 30, 2017. We have not\n \nborrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of June 30, 2017.\nWe monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.6 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $42.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.7 million and ($6.2) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Net cash (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was ($34.3) million and ($6.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, we sold $4.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities was $34.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $28.7 million, net proceeds of $20.4 million for the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the initial public offering, partially offset by net repayments of $11.0 million for borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of June 30, 2017, totaled $11.5 million, or 6.7%, of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nCapital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At June 30, 2017, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At June 30, 2017, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $22.0 million, unused lines of credit totaling $8.0 million and no stand-by letters of credit outstanding. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from June 30, 2017 totaled $11.5 million. Management expects that a substantial\n \nportion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 113: <table> <tr>
