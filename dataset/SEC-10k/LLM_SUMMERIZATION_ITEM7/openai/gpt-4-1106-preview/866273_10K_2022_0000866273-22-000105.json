Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of GAAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReportable Segments\nWe operate our business through three reportable segments:\n\u2022Utility and Power Infrastructure: consists of power delivery services provided to investor-owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, transmission and distribution line installations, upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide engineering, fabrication, and construction services for LNG utility peak shaving facilities, and construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, including natural gas fired facilities, in simple or combined cycle configuration.\n\u2022Process and Industrial Facilities: primarily serves customers in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.\n\u2022Storage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.\nOverview\nThe majority of the work for all segments is performed in the United States, with 9.5% of revenue generated internationally during fiscal 2022, 10.2% in fiscal 2021 and 7.3% in fiscal 2020. The percentage of revenue generated internationally decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher levels of revenue generated domestically.\nSignificant period to period changes in revenue, gross profits and operating results between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are discussed below on a consolidated basis for each segment. A discussion of results of operations changes between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on September 13, 2021.\nMatrix Service Company\nResults of Operations\n(In thousands)\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2022 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. However, delays in project starts on certain projects in our backlog as well as delays in awards of larger projects have negatively impacted our operating results. Therefore, we have not been able to generate enough revenue to fully recover construction overhead and SG&A costs despite significant reductions in our cost structure. In addition, projects bid during a competitive environment and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects have further pressured profitability during the fiscal year (see the discussion of our fiscal 2022 results, and Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 - Revenue - Revisions in Estimates, for more information). Based on improving market conditions and strong bidding activity, we are expecting project awards to increase into fiscal 2023, which we expect to lead to higher revenue volume, increased cost leverage, better margins, and improved earnings.\nIn fiscal 2022, we commenced the second phase of our ongoing business improvement plan to focus on centralization of support functions, including business development, accounting, human resources, procurement and project services into shared service centers. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we estimate that we have reduced our cost structure by approximately $83 million, or approximately 30%, with approximately one-third of those reductions related to SG&A and the rest related to construction overhead, which is included in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information about our business improvement plan.\nIn order to more clearly depict our core profitability, the following tables present our operating results after certain adjustments:\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)(1)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss, as reported </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,074) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs incurred </td> <td> </td> <td>646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and intangible asset impairments </td> <td> </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of facilities(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(32,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax valuation allowance(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>17,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax impact of adjustments and other net tax items </td> <td> </td> <td>4,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,739) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,207) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,807 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per fully diluted share, as reported </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.39) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.24) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.00) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.99) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)This table presents non-GAAP financial measures of our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The most directly comparable financial measures are net loss and loss per fully diluted share, respectively, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they more clearly depict our core operating results during the periods presented and provide a more comparable measure of our operating results to other companies considered to be in similar businesses. Since adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\n(3)Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information).\n(4)See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe have presented Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net loss before goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, restructuring costs, gain on sale of facilities, stock-based compensation, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. We believe that the line item on our Consolidated Statements of Income entitled Net loss\u201d is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure is not a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. As Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain financial information compared with net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded. Our non-GAAP performance measure, Adjusted EBITDA, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\u2022It does not include impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. While impairments to intangible assets are non-cash expenses in the period recognized, cash or other consideration was still transferred in exchange for the intangible assets in the period of the acquisition. Any measure that excludes impairments to intangible assets has material limitations since these expenses represent the loss of an asset that was acquired in exchange for cash or other assets.\n\u2022It does not include gain on sale of facilities. While the sale occurred outside the normal course of business and similar sales are not expected to be recurring or sustainable, any measure that excludes this gain has inherent limitations since the sale resulted in a material inflow of cash.\n\u2022It does not include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs represent material costs that we incurred and are oftentimes cash expenses. Therefore, any measure that excludes restructuring costs has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation represents material amounts of equity that are awarded to our employees and directors for services rendered. While the expense is non-cash, we release vested shares out of our treasury stock, which has historically been replenished by using cash to periodically repurchase our stock. Therefore, any measure that excludes stock-based compensation has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations and to acquire businesses, pay commitment fees to maintain our senior secured revolving credit facility, and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility, interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include depreciation or amortization expense. Because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,074) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of facilities(1)\n</td> <td>(32,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs </td> <td>646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td>7,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>2,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for federal, state and foreign income taxes </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,039) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,570) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>15,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45,635) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,934) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,479 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\nFiscal 2022 Versus Fiscal 2021\nConsolidated\nConsolidated revenue was $707.8 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $673.4 million in fiscal 2021. On a segment basis, revenue increased in the Process and Industrial Facilities and Utility and Power Infrastructure segments by $54.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $30.6 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) was ($1.2) million in fiscal 2022 compared to $32.8 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin (loss) was (0.2)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2021. Gross margins in fiscal 2022 were negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. In addition, the competitive bidding environment and increased forecasts in costs to complete projects negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margins in fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs, lower than previously forecasted margins on large capital projects in the Utility and Power Infrastructure and Storage and Terminal Solutions segments, and an unfavorable settlement on a contract dispute in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $67.7 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $69.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to implemented cost reductions.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded $18.3 million of goodwill impairment. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill, for more information about the impairments.\nAs a result of actions taken to reduce our cost structure, we recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs in fiscal 2022. These costs were net of a $1.6 million credit recorded in restructuring costs in the third quarter. The credit was due to a favorable settlement of a restructuring obligation related to our exit from the domestic iron and steel industry in fiscal 2020. See \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section and Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information.\nInterest expense was $3.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2021. Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees in the first quarter (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information.) The remaining interest expense in fiscal 2022 was comprised of letter of credit fees, unused capacity fees, interest on outstanding advances, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nOther income included a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was (9.6)% compared to 27.8% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2022 was primarily impacted by a $17.9 million valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by a provision of the CARES Act that allowed us to carryback $5.2 million of the fiscal 2021 net operating loss to a period with a higher statutory federal income tax rate. The carryback benefit was offset by $2.8 million of valuation allowances on various deferred tax assets and $1.8 million of excess tax expense related to the vesting of stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, net loss was $63.9 million and $31.2 million, respectively; or $2.39 and $1.18 per fully diluted share, respectively.\nUtility and Power Infrastructure\nRevenue for the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment was $220.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $210.1 million in fiscal 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes of power generation and power delivery work, partially offset by lower volumes of natural gas utility peak shaving and storm response service work.\nThe segment gross margin (loss) was (3.9)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was materially impacted by changes in the forecasted costs to complete two large capital projects. Improved execution on the first project resulted in an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million during the second half of fiscal 2022. However, increases in the forecasted costs to complete this project during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $3.6 million during the year. The increase in forecasted costs during the first half of the fiscal year was principally due to unexpected equipment repairs during commissioning that delayed the scheduled completion and increased the estimated costs to complete. We achieved a critical performance milestone during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which significantly reduced our financial exposure on the project.\nIncreased forecasted costs to the complete the second project resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2022. We recognized $78.1 million of revenue on this project during the year at a near break-even margin as a result of the change in estimate. The increase in forecasted costs was the result of higher than anticipated subcontractor costs and labor costs as the project neared completion. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was also negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs, and by an unfavorable settlement of a claim with a customer in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nResults of operations in fiscal 2021 were materially impacted by increases in the forecasted costs to complete a large capital project. This project reduced gross profit by $5.8 million in fiscal 2021. The changes in estimate were due to lower than previously forecasted productivity caused by excessive rain at the project site, the impact of COVID-19, and rework which led to higher costs and schedule compression. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by good project execution in the remainder of the segment.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities\nRevenue for the Process and Industrial Facilities segment was $254.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $199.9 million in fiscal 2021. The increase of $54.9 million is primarily due to higher levels of refinery maintenance and turnaround work.\nThe segment gross margin was 3.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 8.8% in fiscal 2021. Despite generally strong project execution and higher volumes, the segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by an increase in forecasted costs to complete a midstream gas processing project. The project reduced gross profit by $8.7 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs was primarily due to poor performance of a now terminated subcontractor, which required rework, as well as supply chain and escalation issues, in order to meet our client's expectations. Segment gross margin was also negatively impacted by under recovered construction overhead costs in fiscal 2022.\nSegment gross margin in fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by strong project execution and the positive impact of a one-time workers' compensation item recorded in the second quarter, but these positive impacts were partially offset by lower revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions\nRevenue for the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment was $232.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $263.4 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $30.6 million. The decrease in segment revenue is primarily a result of lower volumes of crude oil tank and terminal capital work.\nThe segment gross margin was 0.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 5.2% in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs and a lower than previously forecasted margin on a thermal energy storage tank repair and maintenance project due to changes in repair scope, expanded client weld testing and associated schedule delays, which reduced segment gross profit by $6.3 million. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by smaller competitively priced capital projects.\nThe fiscal 2021 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by increases in the costs to complete a large crude oil terminal project, partially offset by an increase in the estimated recovery of those costs. During the third quarter, we achieved mechanical completion on the project, demobilized and completed our assessment of unpriced change orders. The project's financial impact for fiscal 2021 was a $3.8 million reduction to gross profit. In addition, a settlement on a contract dispute over the construction of a crude oil terminal negatively impacted gross profit by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter. The settlement resulted in a cash receipt of $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which enabled us to avoid future legal costs and litigation risk. Fiscal 2021 gross margin was also negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nCorporate\nUnallocated corporate expenses were $30.3 million during fiscal 2022 compared to $26.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs for outstanding litigation (see Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 7 - Commitment and Contingencies, for more information), third party consulting services and centralization of support costs related to restructuring activities (see \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section), partially offset by cost reductions we implemented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nWe define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity at June 30, 2022 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand, capacity under our ABL Facility (see \"ABL Credit Facility\" in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information), and cash generated from operations. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 totaled $52.4 million and availability under the ABL Facility totaled $42.5 million, resulting in total liquidity of $94.8 million.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our liquidity for the year ended June 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity at June 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by operating activities </td> <td>(54,196) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(3,345) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from asset sales(1)\n</td> <td>39,018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net borrowings under ABL Facility </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining availability under ABL Facility </td> <td>42,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash restricted in support of ABL Facility </td> <td>(25,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by other financing activities </td> <td>(2,301) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td>(683) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity at June 30, 2022 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes $37.4 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information. The remaining asset sales comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the near- and intermediate-term business impacts from supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the dislocation of certain energy and industrial markets following the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the war between Ukraine and Russia. During fiscal 2022, low revenue volume, a competitive bidding environment, and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects led to a $54.2 million use of cash by operating activities, which negatively impacted our liquidity position. However, we improved our liquidity position by entering into a sale-leaseback transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which resulted in $37.4 million in proceeds (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) In addition, we added $32.5 million of liquidity as a result of entering into the ABL Facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nWe continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support our near- to intermediate-term needs. We are taking the following actions:\n\u2022strategic review of business processes and organizational structure;\n\u2022proactive management of the cost structure and working capital; and\n\u2022eliminating all non-critical capital expenditures.\nFactors that routinely impact our short-term liquidity and may impact our long-term liquidity include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings:\n\u25e6some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers;\n\u25e6some fixed price customer contracts allow for significant upfront billings at the beginning of a project, which temporarily increases liquidity near term;\n\u25e6time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears. Therefore, we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected; and\n\u25e6some of our large construction projects may require security in the form of letters of credit or significant retentions. The timing of collection of retentions is often uncertain;\n\u2022other changes in working capital; and\n\u2022capital expenditures.\nOther factors that may impact both short and long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022contract disputes, which can be significant;\n\u2022collection issues, including those caused by weak commodity prices, economic slowdowns or other factors which can lead to credit deterioration of our customers;\n\u2022issuances of letters of credit; and\n\u2022strategic investments in new operations.\nOther factors that may impact long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022borrowing constraints under our credit facility and maintaining compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022acquisitions and disposals of businesses; and\n\u2022purchases of shares under our stock buyback program.\nCash Flows Used by Operating Activities\nCash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $54.2 million. Major components of cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 are as follows:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used by Operating Activities </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (1)\n</td> <td>(33,114) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>15,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>7,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax </td> <td>5,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash expenses </td> <td>2,425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities </td> <td>(6,408) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(54,196) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment includes a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The remaining gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nCash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 in comparison to June 30, 2021 include the following:\n\u2022Accounts receivable, excluding credit losses recognized during the period, increased $6.6 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. The variance is primarily attributable to higher business volume and the timing of billing and collections.\n\u2022Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts (\"CIE\") increased $14.0 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings (\"BIE\") increased $11.3 million, which increased cash flows from operating activities. CIE and BIE balances can experience significant fluctuations based on business volume and the timing of when job costs are incurred and the timing of customer billings and payments.\n\u2022Inventories, income taxes receivable, other current assets, operating right-of-use lease assets and other non-current assets increased $1.1 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. These operating assets can fluctuate based on the timing of inventory builds and draw-downs, accrual and receipt of income taxes receivable, prepayments of certain expenses, leasing activity, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Accounts payable, accrued wages and benefits, accrued insurance, operating lease liabilities and other accrued expenses increased by $12.2 million during fiscal 2022, which increased cash flows from operating activities. These operating liabilities can fluctuate based on the timing of vendor payments, accruals, leasing activities, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Other liabilities decreased by $7.4 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was primarily due to payment on the deferred payroll tax liability associated with the CARES Act. See Part II., Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes for more information.\nCash Flows Provided by Investing Activities\nInvesting activities provided $35.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to $39.0 million of asset sales, including $37.4 million in proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facilities located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The asset sale proceeds were partially\noffset by $3.3 million of capital expenditures. Capital expenditures consisted of $1.5 million for facilities, office equipment and software, and $1.8 million for construction, fabrication, and transportation equipment.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $12.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the net borrowings of $15.0 million under our ABL Facility, partially offset by $1.3 million paid in fees to enter into the ABL Facility, and $0.9 million paid to repurchase our stock for payment of withholding taxes due on equity-based compensation.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn October 5, 2022, we and our primary U.S. and Canada operating subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which amended our asset-backed credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), dated as of September 9, 2021 with Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Letter of Credit Issuer, and the lenders named therein. The Amendment (i) waives an event of default resulting from our failure to deliver the Administrative Agent and the lenders our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 by September 28, 2022 (the Audited Financial Statements\u201d), provided we deliver the Audited Financial Statements by October 14, 2022, (ii) reduces the maximum amount of loans under the ABL Facility to $90.0 million from $100.0 million and (iii) replaces the London interbank offered rate with the forward term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (the SOFR\u201d) as the interest rate benchmark.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our remaining U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. The ABL Facility available borrowings may be increased by an amount not to exceed $15.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments. The ABL Facility is intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, issuances of letters of credit and other lawful purposes. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first lien on all our assets and the assets of our co-borrowers and guarantors under the ABL Facility.\nThe maximum amount that we may borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves. We are required to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times, but such amounts are also included in the borrowing base. The ABL Facility matures and any outstanding amounts become due and payable on September 9, 2026. At June 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $80.8 million, we had $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings, and $23.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in availability of $42.5 million under the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay cash dividends, issue equity instruments, make distribution or redeem or repurchase capital stock. In the event that our availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 15.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. We are in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of June 30, 2022.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe ABL Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), that was entered into on November 2, 2020, and subsequently amended on May 4, 2021, by and among us and certain foreign subsidiaries, as Borrowers, various subsidiaries of ours, as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the other Lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a three-year\nsenior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that expired November 2, 2023. We had no borrowings and $41.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement as of the date we commenced the ABL Facility. Interest expense during the fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and the terms of our ABL Facility limit dividends to stock dividends only. Any future dividend payments will depend on the terms of our ABL Facility, our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,349,037 shares available for repurchase under the Stock Buyback Program. The terms of our ABL Facility limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nTreasury Shares\nWe had 1,097,703 treasury shares as of June 30, 2022 and intend to utilize these treasury shares in connection with equity awards under the our stock incentive plans and for sales to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2022, our short-term and long-term material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations were as follows:\n\u2022Operating Leases: In the normal course of business, we lease real estate and equipment under various arrangements which are classified as operating leases. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were $31.7 million at June 30, 2022, with $7.0 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 8 - Leases, for more information about our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n\u2022Outstanding Debt and Interest Payments: As of June 30, 2022, the amount outstanding under our ABL Facility was $15.0 million. Based on the outstanding balance and interest rates applicable as of June 30, 2022, if we carried the borrowings to the maturity of the facility, we would make total interest payments on the outstanding debt of $6.8 million, with $1.6 million payable within the next 12 months. The outstanding borrowings are due on September 9, 2026 when the ABL Facility matures. Future interest payments will be determined based on prevailing interest rates during that time. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information about the terms of our ABL Facility.\n\u2022Deferred Payroll Taxes: We have deferred $5.6 million of U.S. payroll tax as of June 30, 2022 through provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). We must repay these deferred payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred payroll taxes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments\nThe terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies, and provide to our customers, surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts. These surety bonds are issued in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of the bond, and secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts. We have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf. Surety bonds expire at various times ranging from final completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. As of June 30, 2022, there were $140.6 million of surety bonds in force, of which we expect $90.3 million to expire within the next 12 months. We are not aware of any losses in connection with surety bonds that have been posted on our behalf, and we do not expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe issue letters of credit under our ABL Facility in the normal course of business to support workers' compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts. As of June 30, 2022, we had $23.3 million of letters of credit outstanding, nearly all of which expire within the next 12 months. The letters of credit that support our workers' compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of our credit facility. The letters of credit that support construction contracts carry expiration dates throughout fiscal 2023.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral Information about our Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue comes from contracts to provide engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction, repair and maintenance and other services. Our engineering, procurement and fabrication and construction services are usually provided in association with capital projects, which are commonly fixed-price contracts that are billed based on project milestones. Our repair and maintenance services typically are cost reimbursable or time and material based contracts and are billed monthly or, for projects of short duration, at the conclusion of the project. The elapsed time from award to completion of performance may exceed one year for capital projects.\nStep 1: Contract Identification\nWe do not recognize revenue unless we have identified a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether a contract should be combined with other contracts and accounted for as a single contract. This evaluation requires judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue and profit recorded for a given period.\nStep 2: Identify Performance Obligations\nNext, we identify each performance obligation in the contract. A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer. Revenue is recognized separately for each performance obligation in the contract. Many of our contracts have one clearly identifiable performance obligation. However, many of our contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more of the following services: engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, repair and maintenance services. For these contracts, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, we generally identify one performance obligation in our contracts. The determination of the number of performance obligations in a contract requires significant judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue recorded for a given period.\nStep 3: Determine Contract Price\nAfter determining the performance obligations in the contract, we determine the contract price. The contract price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer for completing the performance obligation(s). In a fixed-price contract, the contract price is a single lump-sum amount. In reimbursable and time and materials based contracts, the contract price is determined by the agreed upon rates or reimbursements for time and materials expended in completing the performance obligation(s) in the contract.\nA number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that can either increase or decrease the contract price. These variable consideration amounts are generally earned or incurred based on certain performance metrics, most commonly related to project schedule or cost targets. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount of additional consideration to be received (or paid in the case of penalties), provided that meeting the variable condition is probable. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the contract price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the contract price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We reassess the amount of variable consideration each accounting period until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in the assessed amount of variable consideration are accounted for prospectively as a cumulative adjustment to revenue recognized in the current period.\nStep 4: Assign Contract Price to Performance Obligations\nAfter determining the contract price, we assign such price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, we assign the contract price to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices of the distinct services that comprise each performance obligation.\nStep 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nWe record revenue for contracts with our customers as we satisfy the contracts' performance obligations. We recognize revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts for engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. We measure progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion, since it best depicts the transfer of control of assets being created or enhanced to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue over time for reimbursable and time and material based repair and maintenance contracts since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of those services as we perform work under the contract. As a practical expedient allowed under the revenue accounting standards, we record revenue for these contracts in the amount to which we have a right to invoice for the services performed provided that we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date.\nCosts incurred may include direct labor, direct materials, subcontractor costs and indirect costs, such as salaries and benefits, supplies and tools, equipment costs and insurance costs. Indirect costs are charged to projects based upon direct costs and overhead allocation rates per dollar of direct costs incurred or direct labor hours worked. Typically, customer contracts will include standard warranties that provide assurance that products and services will function as expected. We do not sell separate warranties.\nWe have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the forecasted costs at completion. Due to the nature of the work left to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed-price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Estimates of total cost at completion are made each period and changes in these estimates are accounted for prospectively as cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized in the current period. If estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated.\nChange Orders\nContracts are often modified through change orders, which are changes to the agreed upon scope of work. Most of our change orders, which may be priced or unpriced, are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the contract price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. For unpriced change orders, we estimate the increase or decrease to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Unpriced change orders are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nClaims\nSometimes we seek claims for amounts in excess of the contract price for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or other causes of additional costs incurred by us. Recognition of amounts as additional contract price related to claims is appropriate only if there is a legal basis for the claim. The determination of our legal basis for a claim requires significant judgment. We estimate the change to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Claims are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenue for unpriced change orders and claims of $8.9 million at June 30, 2022 and $14.6 million at June 30, 2021. The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. Generally we expect collection of amounts related to unpriced change orders and claims within twelve months. However, customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, which may extend beyond one year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is a level below our reportable segments.\nWe perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or in between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, to determine whether an impairment exists and to determine the amount of headroom. We define \"headroom\" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing management's estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference, but the impairment may not exceed the balance of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and market multiples, referred to as a market approach, to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments and assumptions including forecasted project awards, discount rate, anticipated revenue growth rate, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan. As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our income approach. For the market approach, significant judgments and assumptions include the selection of guideline companies, forecasted guideline company EBITDA and our forecasted EBITDA. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, we also consider the combined fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2022, which resulted in no impairment. The fiscal 2022 test indicated that four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment. If our view of project opportunities or gross margins deteriorates, particularly for the higher risk reporting units, then we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill.\nWe considered the amount of headroom for each reporting unit when determining whether an impairment existed. The amount of headroom varies by reporting unit. Our significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and other factors may change in the future based on the changing economic and competitive environment in which we operate. Assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged, a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom Sensitivity Analysis </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Goodwill as of June 30, 2022\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baseline Headroom </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Revenue Growth Rate\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Gross Margin\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Discount Rate Increases by 100 Basis Points </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-3% </td> <td> </td> <td>-20% </td> <td> </td> <td>-3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>-2% </td> <td> </td> <td>-12% </td> <td> </td> <td>-4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103% </td> <td> </td> <td>87% </td> <td> </td> <td>37% </td> <td> </td> <td>83% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23% </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>17% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> <td> </td> <td>-17% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the third quarter, we concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed based on the decline in the price of our stock and operating results that have underperformed our forecasts during the year. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2022 and concluded that there was $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill, which was recorded as follows:\n\u2022$8.4 million in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment;\n\u2022$7.2 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment; and\n\u2022$2.7 million in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. We believe that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, claims and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or are otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies\u201d. Specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable. We use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known. We believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of GAAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReportable Segments\nWe operate our business through three reportable segments:\n\u2022Utility and Power Infrastructure: consists of power delivery services provided to investor-owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, transmission and distribution line installations, upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide engineering, fabrication, and construction services for LNG utility peak shaving facilities, and construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, including natural gas fired facilities, in simple or combined cycle configuration.\n\u2022Process and Industrial Facilities: primarily serves customers in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.\n\u2022Storage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.\nOverview\nThe majority of the work for all segments is performed in the United States, with 9.5% of revenue generated internationally during fiscal 2022, 10.2% in fiscal 2021 and 7.3% in fiscal 2020. The percentage of revenue generated internationally decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher levels of revenue generated domestically.\nSignificant period to period changes in revenue, gross profits and operating results between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are discussed below on a consolidated basis for each segment. A discussion of results of operations changes between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on September 13,

2022 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. However, delays in project starts on certain projects in our backlog as well as delays in awards of larger projects have negatively impacted our operating results. Therefore, we have not been able to generate enough revenue to fully recover construction overhead and SG&A costs despite significant reductions in our cost structure. In addition, projects bid during a competitive environment and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects have further pressured profitability during the fiscal year (see the discussion of our fiscal 2022 results, and Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 - Revenue - Revisions in Estimates, for more information). Based on improving market conditions and strong bidding activity, we are expecting project awards to increase into fiscal 2023, which we expect to lead to higher revenue volume, increased cost leverage, better margins, and improved earnings.\nIn fiscal 2022, we commenced the second phase of our ongoing business improvement plan to focus on centralization of support functions, including business development, accounting, human resources, procurement and project services into shared service centers. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we estimate that we have reduced our cost structure by approximately $83 million, or approximately 30%, with approximately one-third of those reductions related to SG&A and the rest related to construction overhead, which is included in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information about our business improvement plan.\nIn order to more clearly depict our core profitability, the following tables present our operating results after certain adjustments:\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)(1)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss, as reported </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,074) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs incurred </td> <td> </td> <td>646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and intangible asset impairments </td> <td> </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of facilities(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(32,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax valuation allowance(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>17,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax impact of adjustments and other net tax items </td> <td> </td> <td>4,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,739) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53,409) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,207) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,807 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per fully diluted share, as reported </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.39) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.24) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.00) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.99) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1)This table presents non-GAAP financial measures of our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The most directly comparable financial measures are net loss and loss per fully diluted share, respectively, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they more clearly depict our core operating results during the periods presented and provide a more comparable measure of our operating results to other companies considered to be in similar businesses. Since adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\n(3)Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information).\n(4)See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe have presented Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net loss before goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, restructuring costs, gain on sale of facilities, stock-based compensation, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. We believe that the line item on our Consolidated Statements of Income entitled Net loss\u201d is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure is not a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. As Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain financial information compared with net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded. Our non-GAAP performance measure, Adjusted EBITDA, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\u2022It does not include impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. While impairments to intangible assets are non-cash expenses in the period recognized, cash or other consideration was still transferred in exchange for the intangible assets in the period of the acquisition. Any measure that excludes impairments to intangible assets has material limitations since these expenses represent the loss of an asset that was acquired in exchange for cash or other assets.\n\u2022It does not include gain on sale of facilities. While the sale occurred outside the normal course of business and similar sales are not expected to be recurring or sustainable, any measure that excludes this gain has inherent limitations since the sale resulted in a material inflow of cash.\n\u2022It does not include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs represent material costs that we incurred and are oftentimes cash expenses. Therefore, any measure that excludes restructuring costs has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation represents material amounts of equity that are awarded to our employees and directors for services rendered. While the expense is non-cash, we release vested shares out of our treasury stock, which has historically been replenished by using cash to periodically repurchase our stock. Therefore, any measure that excludes stock-based compensation has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations and to acquire businesses, pay commitment fees to maintain our senior secured revolving credit facility, and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility, interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include depreciation or amortization expense. Because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,074) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of facilities(1)\n</td> <td>(32,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs </td> <td>646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td>7,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>2,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,597 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for federal, state and foreign income taxes </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,039) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,570) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>15,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45,635) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,934) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,479 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\nFiscal 2022 Versus Fiscal 2021\nConsolidated\nConsolidated revenue was $707.8 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $673.4 million in fiscal 2021. On a segment basis, revenue increased in the Process and Industrial Facilities and Utility and Power Infrastructure segments by $54.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $30.6 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) was ($1.2) million in fiscal 2022 compared to $32.8 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin (loss) was (0.2)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2021. Gross margins in fiscal 2022 were negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. In addition, the competitive bidding environment and increased forecasts in costs to complete projects negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margins in fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs, lower than previously forecasted margins on large capital projects in the Utility and Power Infrastructure and Storage and Terminal Solutions segments, and an unfavorable settlement on a contract dispute in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $67.7 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $69.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to implemented cost reductions.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded $18.3 million of goodwill impairment. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill, for more information about the impairments.\nAs a result of actions taken to reduce our cost structure, we recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs in fiscal 2022. These costs were net of a $1.6 million credit recorded in restructuring costs in the third quarter. The credit was due to a favorable settlement of a restructuring obligation related to our exit from the domestic iron and steel industry in fiscal 2020. See \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section and Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information.\nInterest expense was $3.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2021. Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees in the first quarter (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information.) The remaining interest expense in fiscal 2022 was comprised of letter of credit fees, unused capacity fees, interest on outstanding advances, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nOther income included a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was (9.6)% compared to 27.8% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2022 was primarily impacted by a $17.9 million valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by a provision of the CARES Act that allowed us to carryback $5.2 million of the fiscal 2021 net operating loss to a period with a higher statutory federal income tax rate. The carryback benefit was offset by $2.8 million of valuation allowances on various deferred tax assets and $1.8 million of excess tax expense related to the vesting of stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, net loss was $63.9 million and $31.2 million, respectively; or $2.39 and $1.18 per fully diluted share, respectively.\nUtility and Power Infrastructure\nRevenue for the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment was $220.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $210.1 million in fiscal 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes of power generation and power delivery work, partially offset by lower volumes of natural gas utility peak shaving and storm response service work.\nThe segment gross margin (loss) was (3.9)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was materially impacted by changes in the forecasted costs to complete two large capital projects. Improved execution on the first project resulted in an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million during the second half of fiscal 2022. However, increases in the forecasted costs to complete this project during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $3.6 million during the year. The increase in forecasted costs during the first half of the fiscal year was principally due to unexpected equipment repairs during commissioning that delayed the scheduled completion and increased the estimated costs to complete. We achieved a critical performance milestone during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which significantly reduced our financial exposure on the project.\nIncreased forecasted costs to the complete the second project resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2022. We recognized $78.1 million of revenue on this project during the year at a near break-even margin as a result of the change in estimate. The increase in forecasted costs was the result of higher than anticipated subcontractor costs and labor costs as the project neared completion. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was also negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs, and by an unfavorable settlement of a claim with a customer in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nResults of operations in fiscal 2021 were materially impacted by increases in the forecasted costs to complete a large capital project. This project reduced gross profit by $5.8 million in fiscal 2021. The changes in estimate were due to lower than previously forecasted productivity caused by excessive rain at the project site, the impact of COVID-19, and rework which led to higher costs and schedule compression. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by good project execution in the remainder of the segment.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities\nRevenue for the Process and Industrial Facilities segment was $254.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $199.9 million in fiscal 2021. The increase of $54.9 million is primarily due to higher levels of refinery maintenance and turnaround work.\nThe segment gross margin was 3.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 8.8% in fiscal 2021. Despite generally strong project execution and higher volumes, the segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by an increase in forecasted costs to complete a midstream gas processing project. The project reduced gross profit by $8.7 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs was primarily due to poor performance of a now terminated subcontractor, which required rework, as well as supply chain and escalation issues, in order to meet our client's expectations. Segment gross margin was also negatively impacted by under recovered construction overhead costs in fiscal 2022.\nSegment gross margin in fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by strong project execution and the positive impact of a one-time workers' compensation item recorded in the second quarter, but these positive impacts were partially offset by lower revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions\nRevenue for the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment was $232.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $263.4 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $30.6 million. The decrease in segment revenue is primarily a result of lower volumes of crude oil tank and terminal capital work.\nThe segment gross margin was 0.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 5.2% in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs and a lower than previously forecasted margin on a thermal energy storage tank repair and maintenance project due to changes in repair scope, expanded client weld testing and associated schedule delays, which reduced segment gross profit by $6.3 million. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by smaller competitively priced capital projects.\nThe fiscal 2021 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by increases in the costs to complete a large crude oil terminal project, partially offset by an increase in the estimated recovery of those costs. During the third quarter, we achieved mechanical completion on the project, demobilized and completed our assessment of unpriced change orders. The project's financial impact for fiscal 2021 was a $3.8 million reduction to gross profit. In addition, a settlement on a contract dispute over the construction of a crude oil terminal negatively impacted gross profit by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter. The settlement resulted in a cash receipt of $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which enabled us to avoid future legal costs and litigation risk. Fiscal 2021 gross margin was also negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nCorporate\nUnallocated corporate expenses were $30.3 million during fiscal 2022 compared to $26.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs for outstanding litigation (see Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 7 - Commitment and Contingencies, for more information), third party consulting services and centralization of support costs related to restructuring activities (see \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section), partially offset by cost reductions we implemented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nWe define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity at June 30, 2022 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand, capacity under our ABL Facility (see \"ABL Credit Facility\" in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information), and cash generated from operations. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 totaled $52.4 million and availability under the ABL Facility totaled $42.5 million, resulting in total liquidity of $94.8 million.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our liquidity for the year ended June 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity at June 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by operating activities </td> <td>(54,196) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(3,345) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from asset sales(1)\n</td> <td>39,018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net borrowings under ABL Facility </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining availability under ABL Facility </td> <td>42,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash restricted in support of ABL Facility </td> <td>(25,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by other financing activities </td> <td>(2,301) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td>(683) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity at June 30, 2022 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1)Includes $37.4 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information. The remaining asset sales comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the near- and intermediate-term business impacts from supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the dislocation of certain energy and industrial markets following the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the war between Ukraine and Russia. During fiscal 2022, low revenue volume, a competitive bidding environment, and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects led to a $54.2 million use of cash by operating activities, which negatively impacted our liquidity position. However, we improved our liquidity position by entering into a sale-leaseback transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which resulted in $37.4 million in proceeds (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) In addition, we added $32.5 million of liquidity as a result of entering into the ABL Facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nWe continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support our near- to intermediate-term needs. We are taking the following actions:\n\u2022strategic review of business processes and organizational structure;\n\u2022proactive management of the cost structure and working capital; and\n\u2022eliminating all non-critical capital expenditures.\nFactors that routinely impact our short-term liquidity and may impact our long-term liquidity include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings:\n\u25e6some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers;\n\u25e6some fixed price customer contracts allow for significant upfront billings at the beginning of a project, which temporarily increases liquidity near term;\n\u25e6time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears. Therefore, we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected; and\n\u25e6some of our large construction projects may require security in the form of letters of credit or significant retentions. The timing of collection of retentions is often uncertain;\n\u2022other changes in working capital; and\n\u2022capital expenditures.\nOther factors that may impact both short and long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022contract disputes, which can be significant;\n\u2022collection issues, including those caused by weak commodity prices, economic slowdowns or other factors which can lead to credit deterioration of our customers;\n\u2022issuances of letters of credit; and\n\u2022strategic investments in new operations.\nOther factors that may impact long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022borrowing constraints under our credit facility and maintaining compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022acquisitions and disposals of businesses; and\n\u2022purchases of shares under our stock buyback program.\nCash Flows Used by Operating Activities\nCash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $54.2 million. Major components of cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 are as follows:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used by Operating Activities </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,900) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (1)\n</td> <td>(33,114) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>18,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>15,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>7,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax </td> <td>5,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash expenses </td> <td>2,425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities </td> <td>(6,408) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(54,196) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1)Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment includes a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The remaining gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nCash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 in comparison to June 30, 2021 include the following:\n\u2022Accounts receivable, excluding credit losses recognized during the period, increased $6.6 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. The variance is primarily attributable to higher business volume and the timing of billing and collections.\n\u2022Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts (\"CIE\") increased $14.0 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings (\"BIE\") increased $11.3 million, which increased cash flows from operating activities. CIE and BIE balances can experience significant fluctuations based on business volume and the timing of when job costs are incurred and the timing of customer billings and payments.\n\u2022Inventories, income taxes receivable, other current assets, operating right-of-use lease assets and other non-current assets increased $1.1 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. These operating assets can fluctuate based on the timing of inventory builds and draw-downs, accrual and receipt of income taxes receivable, prepayments of certain expenses, leasing activity, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Accounts payable, accrued wages and benefits, accrued insurance, operating lease liabilities and other accrued expenses increased by $12.2 million during fiscal 2022, which increased cash flows from operating activities. These operating liabilities can fluctuate based on the timing of vendor payments, accruals, leasing activities, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Other liabilities decreased by $7.4 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was primarily due to payment on the deferred payroll tax liability associated with the CARES Act. See Part II., Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes for more information.\nCash Flows Provided by Investing Activities\nInvesting activities provided $35.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to $39.0 million of asset sales, including $37.4 million in proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facilities located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The asset sale proceeds were partially\noffset by $3.3 million of capital expenditures. Capital expenditures consisted of $1.5 million for facilities, office equipment and software, and $1.8 million for construction, fabrication, and transportation equipment.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $12.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the net borrowings of $15.0 million under our ABL Facility, partially offset by $1.3 million paid in fees to enter into the ABL Facility, and $0.9 million paid to repurchase our stock for payment of withholding taxes due on equity-based compensation.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn October 5, 2022, we and our primary U.S. and Canada operating subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which amended our asset-backed credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), dated as of September 9, 2021 with Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Letter of Credit Issuer, and the lenders named therein. The Amendment (i) waives an event of default resulting from our failure to deliver the Administrative Agent and the lenders our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 by September 28, 2022 (the Audited Financial Statements\u201d), provided we deliver the Audited Financial Statements by October 14, 2022, (ii) reduces the maximum amount of loans under the ABL Facility to $90.0 million from $100.0 million and (iii) replaces the London interbank offered rate with the forward term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (the SOFR\u201d) as the interest rate benchmark.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our remaining U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. The ABL Facility available borrowings may be increased by an amount not to exceed $15.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments. The ABL Facility is intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, issuances of letters of credit and other lawful purposes. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first lien on all our assets and the assets of our co-borrowers and guarantors under the ABL Facility.\nThe maximum amount that we may borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves. We are required to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times, but such amounts are also included in the borrowing base. The ABL Facility matures and any outstanding amounts become due and payable on September 9, 2026. At June 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $80.8 million, we had $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings, and $23.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in availability of $42.5 million under the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay cash dividends, issue equity instruments, make distribution or redeem or repurchase capital stock. In the event that our availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 15.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. We are in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of June 30, 2022.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe ABL Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), that was entered into on November 2, 2020, and subsequently amended on May 4, 2021, by and among us and certain foreign subsidiaries, as Borrowers, various subsidiaries of ours, as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the other Lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a three-year\nsenior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that expired November 2, 2023. We had no borrowings and $41.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement as of the date we commenced the ABL Facility. Interest expense during the fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and the terms of our ABL Facility limit dividends to stock dividends only. Any future dividend payments will depend on the terms of our ABL Facility, our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,349,037 shares available for repurchase under the Stock Buyback Program. The terms of our ABL Facility limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nTreasury Shares\nWe had 1,097,703 treasury shares as of June 30, 2022 and intend to utilize these treasury shares in connection with equity awards under the our stock incentive plans and for sales to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2022, our short-term and long-term material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations were as follows:\n\u2022Operating Leases: In the normal course of business, we lease real estate and equipment under various arrangements which are classified as operating leases. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were $31.7 million at June 30, 2022, with $7.0 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 8 - Leases, for more information about our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n\u2022Outstanding Debt and Interest Payments: As of June 30, 2022, the amount outstanding under our ABL Facility was $15.0 million. Based on the outstanding balance and interest rates applicable as of June 30, 2022, if we carried the borrowings to the maturity of the facility, we would make total interest payments on the outstanding debt of $6.8 million, with $1.6 million payable within the next 12 months. The outstanding borrowings are due on September 9, 2026 when the ABL Facility matures. Future interest payments will be determined based on prevailing interest rates during that time. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information about the terms of our ABL Facility.\n\u2022Deferred Payroll Taxes: We have deferred $5.6 million of U.S. payroll tax as of June 30, 2022 through provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). We must repay these deferred payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred payroll taxes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments\nThe terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies, and provide to our customers, surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts. These surety bonds are issued in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of the bond, and secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts. We have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf. Surety bonds expire at various times ranging from final completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. As of June 30, 2022, there were $140.6 million of surety bonds in force, of which we expect $90.3 million to expire within the next 12 months. We are not aware of any losses in connection with surety bonds that have been posted on our behalf, and we do not expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe issue letters of credit under our ABL Facility in the normal course of business to support workers' compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts. As of June 30, 2022, we had $23.3 million of letters of credit outstanding, nearly all of which expire within the next 12 months. The letters of credit that support our workers' compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of our credit facility. The letters of credit that support construction contracts carry expiration dates throughout fiscal 2023.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral Information about our Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue comes from contracts to provide engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction, repair and maintenance and other services. Our engineering, procurement and fabrication and construction services are usually provided in association with capital projects, which are commonly fixed-price contracts that are billed based on project milestones. Our repair and maintenance services typically are cost reimbursable or time and material based contracts and are billed monthly or, for projects of short duration, at the conclusion of the project. The elapsed time from award to completion of performance may exceed one year for capital projects.\nStep 1: Contract Identification\nWe do not recognize revenue unless we have identified a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether a contract should be combined with other contracts and accounted for as a single contract. This evaluation requires judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue and profit recorded for a given period.\nStep 2: Identify Performance Obligations\nNext, we identify each performance obligation in the contract. A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer. Revenue is recognized separately for each performance obligation in the contract. Many of our contracts have one clearly identifiable performance obligation. However, many of our contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more of the following services: engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, repair and maintenance services. For these contracts, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, we generally identify one performance obligation in our contracts. The determination of the number of performance obligations in a contract requires significant judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue recorded for a given period.\nStep 3: Determine Contract Price\nAfter determining the performance obligations in the contract, we determine the contract price. The contract price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer for completing the performance obligation(s). In a fixed-price contract, the contract price is a single lump-sum amount. In reimbursable and time and materials based contracts, the contract price is determined by the agreed upon rates or reimbursements for time and materials expended in completing the performance obligation(s) in the contract.\nA number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that can either increase or decrease the contract price. These variable consideration amounts are generally earned or incurred based on certain performance metrics, most commonly related to project schedule or cost targets. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount of additional consideration to be received (or paid in the case of penalties), provided that meeting the variable condition is probable. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the contract price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the contract price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We reassess the amount of variable consideration each accounting period until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in the assessed amount of variable consideration are accounted for prospectively as a cumulative adjustment to revenue recognized in the current period.\nStep 4: Assign Contract Price to Performance Obligations\nAfter determining the contract price, we assign such price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, we assign the contract price to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices of the distinct services that comprise each performance obligation.\nStep 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nWe record revenue for contracts with our customers as we satisfy the contracts' performance obligations. We recognize revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts for engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. We measure progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion, since it best depicts the transfer of control of assets being created or enhanced to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue over time for reimbursable and time and material based repair and maintenance contracts since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of those services as we perform work under the contract. As a practical expedient allowed under the revenue accounting standards, we record revenue for these contracts in the amount to which we have a right to invoice for the services performed provided that we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date.\nCosts incurred may include direct labor, direct materials, subcontractor costs and indirect costs, such as salaries and benefits, supplies and tools, equipment costs and insurance costs. Indirect costs are charged to projects based upon direct costs and overhead allocation rates per dollar of direct costs incurred or direct labor hours worked. Typically, customer contracts will include standard warranties that provide assurance that products and services will function as expected. We do not sell separate warranties.\nWe have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the forecasted costs at completion. Due to the nature of the work left to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed-price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Estimates of total cost at completion are made each period and changes in these estimates are accounted for prospectively as cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized in the current period. If estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated.\nChange Orders\nContracts are often modified through change orders, which are changes to the agreed upon scope of work. Most of our change orders, which may be priced or unpriced, are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the contract price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. For unpriced change orders, we estimate the increase or decrease to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Unpriced change orders are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nClaims\nSometimes we seek claims for amounts in excess of the contract price for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or other causes of additional costs incurred by us. Recognition of amounts as additional contract price related to claims is appropriate only if there is a legal basis for the claim. The determination of our legal basis for a claim requires significant judgment. We estimate the change to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Claims are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenue for unpriced change orders and claims of $8.9 million at June 30, 2022 and $14.6 million at June 30, 2021. The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. Generally we expect collection of amounts related to unpriced change orders and claims within twelve months. However, customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, which may extend beyond one year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is a level below our reportable segments.\nWe perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or in between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, to determine whether an impairment exists and to determine the amount of headroom. We define \"headroom\" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing management's estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference, but the impairment may not exceed the balance of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and market multiples, referred to as a market approach, to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments and assumptions including forecasted project awards, discount rate, anticipated revenue growth rate, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan. As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our income approach. For the market approach, significant judgments and assumptions include the selection of guideline companies, forecasted guideline company EBITDA and our forecasted EBITDA. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, we also consider the combined fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2022, which resulted in no impairment. The fiscal 2022 test indicated that four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment. If our view of project opportunities or gross margins deteriorates, particularly for the higher risk reporting units, then we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill.\nWe considered the amount of headroom for each reporting unit when determining whether an impairment existed. The amount of headroom varies by reporting unit. Our significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and other factors may change in the future based on the changing economic and competitive environment in which we operate. Assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged, a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom Sensitivity Analysis </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Goodwill as of June 30, 2022\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baseline Headroom </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Revenue Growth Rate\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Gross Margin\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points </td> <td> </td> <td>Headroom if Discount Rate Increases by 100 Basis Points </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-3% </td> <td> </td> <td>-20% </td> <td> </td> <td>-3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>-2% </td> <td> </td> <td>-12% </td> <td> </td> <td>-4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103% </td> <td> </td> <td>87% </td> <td> </td> <td>37% </td> <td> </td> <td>83% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23% </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>17% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> <td> </td> <td>-17% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the third quarter, we concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed based on the decline in the price of our stock and operating results that have underperformed our forecasts during the year. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2022 and concluded that there was $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill, which was recorded as follows:\n\u2022$8.4 million in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment;\n\u2022$7.2 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment; and\n\u2022$2.7 million in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. We believe that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, claims and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or are otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies\u201d. Specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable. We use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known. We believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of GAAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReportable Segments\nWe operate our business through three reportable segments:\n\u2022Utility and Power Infrastructure: consists of power delivery services provided to investor-owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, transmission and distribution line installations, upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide engineering, fabrication, and construction services for LNG utility peak shaving facilities, and construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, including natural gas fired facilities, in simple or combined cycle configuration.\n\u2022Process and Industrial Facilities: primarily serves customers in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.\n\u2022Storage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.\nOverview\nThe majority of the work for all segments is performed in the United States, with 9.5% of revenue generated internationally during fiscal 2022, 10.2% in fiscal 2021 and 7.3% in fiscal 2020. The percentage of revenue generated internationally decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher levels of revenue generated domestically.\nSignificant period to period changes in revenue, gross profits and operating results between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are discussed below on a consolidated basis for each segment. A discussion of results of operations changes between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on September 13, 2021.\nMatrix Service Company\nResults of Operations\n(In thousands)\n\nOperational Update\nBidding activity, project award volumes, and revenue volumes all improved in fiscal 2022 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. However, delays in project starts on certain projects in our backlog as well as delays in awards of larger projects have negatively impacted our operating results. Therefore, we have not been able to generate enough revenue to fully recover construction overhead and SG&A costs despite significant reductions in our cost structure. In addition, projects bid during a competitive environment and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects have further pressured profitability during the fiscal year (see the discussion of our fiscal 2022 results, and Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 - Revenue - Revisions in Estimates, for more information). Based on improving market conditions and strong bidding activity, we are expecting project awards to increase into fiscal 2023, which we expect to lead to higher revenue volume, increased cost leverage, better margins, and improved earnings.\nIn fiscal 2022, we commenced the second phase of our ongoing business improvement plan to focus on centralization of support functions, including business development, accounting, human resources, procurement and project services into shared service centers. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we estimate that we have reduced our cost structure by approximately $83 million, or approximately 30%, with approximately one-third of those reductions related to SG&A and the rest related to construction overhead, which is included in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information about our business improvement plan.\nIn order to more clearly depict our core profitability, the following tables present our operating results after certain adjustments:\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)(1)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n\n \n(1)This table presents non-GAAP financial measures of our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The most directly comparable financial measures are net loss and loss per fully diluted share, respectively, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they more clearly depict our core operating results during the periods presented and provide a more comparable measure of our operating results to other companies considered to be in similar businesses. Since adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\n(3)Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information).\n(4)See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe have presented Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net loss before goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, restructuring costs, gain on sale of facilities, stock-based compensation, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. We believe that the line item on our Consolidated Statements of Income entitled Net loss\u201d is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure is not a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. As Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain financial information compared with net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded. Our non-GAAP performance measure, Adjusted EBITDA, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\u2022It does not include impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. While impairments to intangible assets are non-cash expenses in the period recognized, cash or other consideration was still transferred in exchange for the intangible assets in the period of the acquisition. Any measure that excludes impairments to intangible assets has material limitations since these expenses represent the loss of an asset that was acquired in exchange for cash or other assets.\n\u2022It does not include gain on sale of facilities. While the sale occurred outside the normal course of business and similar sales are not expected to be recurring or sustainable, any measure that excludes this gain has inherent limitations since the sale resulted in a material inflow of cash.\n\u2022It does not include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs represent material costs that we incurred and are oftentimes cash expenses. Therefore, any measure that excludes restructuring costs has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation represents material amounts of equity that are awarded to our employees and directors for services rendered. While the expense is non-cash, we release vested shares out of our treasury stock, which has historically been replenished by using cash to periodically repurchase our stock. Therefore, any measure that excludes stock-based compensation has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations and to acquire businesses, pay commitment fees to maintain our senior secured revolving credit facility, and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility, interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations.\n\u2022It does not include depreciation or amortization expense. Because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations.\n\n \n(1)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\nFiscal 2022 Versus Fiscal 2021\nConsolidated\nConsolidated revenue was $707.8 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $673.4 million in fiscal 2021. On a segment basis, revenue increased in the Process and Industrial Facilities and Utility and Power Infrastructure segments by $54.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $30.6 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) was ($1.2) million in fiscal 2022 compared to $32.8 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin (loss) was (0.2)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2021. Gross margins in fiscal 2022 were negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. In addition, the competitive bidding environment and increased forecasts in costs to complete projects negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margins in fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs, lower than previously forecasted margins on large capital projects in the Utility and Power Infrastructure and Storage and Terminal Solutions segments, and an unfavorable settlement on a contract dispute in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $67.7 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $69.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to implemented cost reductions.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded $18.3 million of goodwill impairment. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill, for more information about the impairments.\nAs a result of actions taken to reduce our cost structure, we recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs in fiscal 2022. These costs were net of a $1.6 million credit recorded in restructuring costs in the third quarter. The credit was due to a favorable settlement of a restructuring obligation related to our exit from the domestic iron and steel industry in fiscal 2020. See \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section and Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information.\nInterest expense was $3.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2021. Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees in the first quarter (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information.) The remaining interest expense in fiscal 2022 was comprised of letter of credit fees, unused capacity fees, interest on outstanding advances, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nOther income included a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was (9.6)% compared to 27.8% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2022 was primarily impacted by a $17.9 million valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by a provision of the CARES Act that allowed us to carryback $5.2 million of the fiscal 2021 net operating loss to a period with a higher statutory federal income tax rate. The carryback benefit was offset by $2.8 million of valuation allowances on various deferred tax assets and $1.8 million of excess tax expense related to the vesting of stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, net loss was $63.9 million and $31.2 million, respectively; or $2.39 and $1.18 per fully diluted share, respectively.\nUtility and Power Infrastructure\nRevenue for the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment was $220.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $210.1 million in fiscal 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes of power generation and power delivery work, partially offset by lower volumes of natural gas utility peak shaving and storm response service work.\nThe segment gross margin (loss) was (3.9)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was materially impacted by changes in the forecasted costs to complete two large capital projects. Improved execution on the first project resulted in an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million during the second half of fiscal 2022. However, increases in the forecasted costs to complete this project during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $3.6 million during the year. The increase in forecasted costs during the first half of the fiscal year was principally due to unexpected equipment repairs during commissioning that delayed the scheduled completion and increased the estimated costs to complete. We achieved a critical performance milestone during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which significantly reduced our financial exposure on the project.\nIncreased forecasted costs to the complete the second project resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2022. We recognized $78.1 million of revenue on this project during the year at a near break-even margin as a result of the change in estimate. The increase in forecasted costs was the result of higher than anticipated subcontractor costs and labor costs as the project neared completion. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was also negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs, and by an unfavorable settlement of a claim with a customer in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nResults of operations in fiscal 2021 were materially impacted by increases in the forecasted costs to complete a large capital project. This project reduced gross profit by $5.8 million in fiscal 2021. The changes in estimate were due to lower than previously forecasted productivity caused by excessive rain at the project site, the impact of COVID-19, and rework which led to higher costs and schedule compression. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by good project execution in the remainder of the segment.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities\nRevenue for the Process and Industrial Facilities segment was $254.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $199.9 million in fiscal 2021. The increase of $54.9 million is primarily due to higher levels of refinery maintenance and turnaround work.\nThe segment gross margin was 3.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 8.8% in fiscal 2021. Despite generally strong project execution and higher volumes, the segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by an increase in forecasted costs to complete a midstream gas processing project. The project reduced gross profit by $8.7 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs was primarily due to poor performance of a now terminated subcontractor, which required rework, as well as supply chain and escalation issues, in order to meet our client's expectations. Segment gross margin was also negatively impacted by under recovered construction overhead costs in fiscal 2022.\nSegment gross margin in fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by strong project execution and the positive impact of a one-time workers' compensation item recorded in the second quarter, but these positive impacts were partially offset by lower revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions\nRevenue for the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment was $232.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $263.4 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $30.6 million. The decrease in segment revenue is primarily a result of lower volumes of crude oil tank and terminal capital work.\nThe segment gross margin was 0.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 5.2% in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs and a lower than previously forecasted margin on a thermal energy storage tank repair and maintenance project due to changes in repair scope, expanded client weld testing and associated schedule delays, which reduced segment gross profit by $6.3 million. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by smaller competitively priced capital projects.\nThe fiscal 2021 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by increases in the costs to complete a large crude oil terminal project, partially offset by an increase in the estimated recovery of those costs. During the third quarter, we achieved mechanical completion on the project, demobilized and completed our assessment of unpriced change orders. The project's financial impact for fiscal 2021 was a $3.8 million reduction to gross profit. In addition, a settlement on a contract dispute over the construction of a crude oil terminal negatively impacted gross profit by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter. The settlement resulted in a cash receipt of $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which enabled us to avoid future legal costs and litigation risk. Fiscal 2021 gross margin was also negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nCorporate\nUnallocated corporate expenses were $30.3 million during fiscal 2022 compared to $26.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs for outstanding litigation (see Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 7 - Commitment and Contingencies, for more information), third party consulting services and centralization of support costs related to restructuring activities (see \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section), partially offset by cost reductions we implemented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nWe define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity at June 30, 2022 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand, capacity under our ABL Facility (see \"ABL Credit Facility\" in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information), and cash generated from operations. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 totaled $52.4 million and availability under the ABL Facility totaled $42.5 million, resulting in total liquidity of $94.8 million.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\n\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our liquidity for the year ended June 30, 2022 (in thousands):\n\n \n(1)Includes $37.4 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information. The remaining asset sales comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the near- and intermediate-term business impacts from supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the dislocation of certain energy and industrial markets following the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the war between Ukraine and Russia. During fiscal 2022, low revenue volume, a competitive bidding environment, and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects led to a $54.2 million use of cash by operating activities, which negatively impacted our liquidity position. However, we improved our liquidity position by entering into a sale-leaseback transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which resulted in $37.4 million in proceeds (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) In addition, we added $32.5 million of liquidity as a result of entering into the ABL Facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nWe continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support our near- to intermediate-term needs. We are taking the following actions:\n\u2022strategic review of business processes and organizational structure;\n\u2022proactive management of the cost structure and working capital; and\n\u2022eliminating all non-critical capital expenditures.\nFactors that routinely impact our short-term liquidity and may impact our long-term liquidity include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings:\n\u25e6some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers;\n\u25e6some fixed price customer contracts allow for significant upfront billings at the beginning of a project, which temporarily increases liquidity near term;\n\u25e6time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears. Therefore, we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected; and\n\u25e6some of our large construction projects may require security in the form of letters of credit or significant retentions. The timing of collection of retentions is often uncertain;\n\u2022other changes in working capital; and\n\u2022capital expenditures.\nOther factors that may impact both short and long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022contract disputes, which can be significant;\n\u2022collection issues, including those caused by weak commodity prices, economic slowdowns or other factors which can lead to credit deterioration of our customers;\n\u2022issuances of letters of credit; and\n\u2022strategic investments in new operations.\nOther factors that may impact long-term liquidity include:\n\u2022borrowing constraints under our credit facility and maintaining compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022acquisitions and disposals of businesses; and\n\u2022purchases of shares under our stock buyback program.\nCash Flows Used by Operating Activities\nCash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $54.2 million. Major components of cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 are as follows:\n\n \n(1)Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment includes a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The remaining gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nCash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 in comparison to June 30, 2021 include the following:\n\u2022Accounts receivable, excluding credit losses recognized during the period, increased $6.6 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. The variance is primarily attributable to higher business volume and the timing of billing and collections.\n\u2022Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts (\"CIE\") increased $14.0 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings (\"BIE\") increased $11.3 million, which increased cash flows from operating activities. CIE and BIE balances can experience significant fluctuations based on business volume and the timing of when job costs are incurred and the timing of customer billings and payments.\n\u2022Inventories, income taxes receivable, other current assets, operating right-of-use lease assets and other non-current assets increased $1.1 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. These operating assets can fluctuate based on the timing of inventory builds and draw-downs, accrual and receipt of income taxes receivable, prepayments of certain expenses, leasing activity, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Accounts payable, accrued wages and benefits, accrued insurance, operating lease liabilities and other accrued expenses increased by $12.2 million during fiscal 2022, which increased cash flows from operating activities. These operating liabilities can fluctuate based on the timing of vendor payments, accruals, leasing activities, business volume, and other timing differences.\n\u2022Other liabilities decreased by $7.4 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was primarily due to payment on the deferred payroll tax liability associated with the CARES Act. See Part II., Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes for more information.\nCash Flows Provided by Investing Activities\nInvesting activities provided $35.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to $39.0 million of asset sales, including $37.4 million in proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facilities located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The asset sale proceeds were partially\noffset by $3.3 million of capital expenditures. Capital expenditures consisted of $1.5 million for facilities, office equipment and software, and $1.8 million for construction, fabrication, and transportation equipment.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $12.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the net borrowings of $15.0 million under our ABL Facility, partially offset by $1.3 million paid in fees to enter into the ABL Facility, and $0.9 million paid to repurchase our stock for payment of withholding taxes due on equity-based compensation.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn October 5, 2022, we and our primary U.S. and Canada operating subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which amended our asset-backed credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), dated as of September 9, 2021 with Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Letter of Credit Issuer, and the lenders named therein. The Amendment (i) waives an event of default resulting from our failure to deliver the Administrative Agent and the lenders our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 by September 28, 2022 (the Audited Financial Statements\u201d), provided we deliver the Audited Financial Statements by October 14, 2022, (ii) reduces the maximum amount of loans under the ABL Facility to $90.0 million from $100.0 million and (iii) replaces the London interbank offered rate with the forward term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (the SOFR\u201d) as the interest rate benchmark.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our remaining U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. The ABL Facility available borrowings may be increased by an amount not to exceed $15.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments. The ABL Facility is intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, issuances of letters of credit and other lawful purposes. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first lien on all our assets and the assets of our co-borrowers and guarantors under the ABL Facility.\nThe maximum amount that we may borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves. We are required to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times, but such amounts are also included in the borrowing base. The ABL Facility matures and any outstanding amounts become due and payable on September 9, 2026. At June 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $80.8 million, we had $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings, and $23.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in availability of $42.5 million under the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate ( Base Rate\u201d), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay cash dividends, issue equity instruments, make distribution or redeem or repurchase capital stock. In the event that our availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 15.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. We are in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of June 30, 2022.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe ABL Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), that was entered into on November 2, 2020, and subsequently amended on May 4, 2021, by and among us and certain foreign subsidiaries, as Borrowers, various subsidiaries of ours, as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the other Lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a three-year\nsenior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that expired November 2, 2023. We had no borrowings and $41.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement as of the date we commenced the ABL Facility. Interest expense during the fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and the terms of our ABL Facility limit dividends to stock dividends only. Any future dividend payments will depend on the terms of our ABL Facility, our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,349,037 shares available for repurchase under the Stock Buyback Program. The terms of our ABL Facility limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nTreasury Shares\nWe had 1,097,703 treasury shares as of June 30, 2022 and intend to utilize these treasury shares in connection with equity awards under the our stock incentive plans and for sales to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2022, our short-term and long-term material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations were as follows:\n\u2022Operating Leases: In the normal course of business, we lease real estate and equipment under various arrangements which are classified as operating leases. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were $31.7 million at June 30, 2022, with $7.0 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 8 - Leases, for more information about our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n\u2022Outstanding Debt and Interest Payments: As of June 30, 2022, the amount outstanding under our ABL Facility was $15.0 million. Based on the outstanding balance and interest rates applicable as of June 30, 2022, if we carried the borrowings to the maturity of the facility, we would make total interest payments on the outstanding debt of $6.8 million, with $1.6 million payable within the next 12 months. The outstanding borrowings are due on September 9, 2026 when the ABL Facility matures. Future interest payments will be determined based on prevailing interest rates during that time. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information about the terms of our ABL Facility.\n\u2022Deferred Payroll Taxes: We have deferred $5.6 million of U.S. payroll tax as of June 30, 2022 through provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). We must repay these deferred payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred payroll taxes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments\nThe terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies, and provide to our customers, surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts. These surety bonds are issued in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of the bond, and secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts. We have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf. Surety bonds expire at various times ranging from final completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. As of June 30, 2022, there were $140.6 million of surety bonds in force, of which we expect $90.3 million to expire within the next 12 months. We are not aware of any losses in connection with surety bonds that have been posted on our behalf, and we do not expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe issue letters of credit under our ABL Facility in the normal course of business to support workers' compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts. As of June 30, 2022, we had $23.3 million of letters of credit outstanding, nearly all of which expire within the next 12 months. The letters of credit that support our workers' compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of our credit facility. The letters of credit that support construction contracts carry expiration dates throughout fiscal 2023.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral Information about our Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue comes from contracts to provide engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction, repair and maintenance and other services. Our engineering, procurement and fabrication and construction services are usually provided in association with capital projects, which are commonly fixed-price contracts that are billed based on project milestones. Our repair and maintenance services typically are cost reimbursable or time and material based contracts and are billed monthly or, for projects of short duration, at the conclusion of the project. The elapsed time from award to completion of performance may exceed one year for capital projects.\nStep 1: Contract Identification\nWe do not recognize revenue unless we have identified a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether a contract should be combined with other contracts and accounted for as a single contract. This evaluation requires judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue and profit recorded for a given period.\nStep 2: Identify Performance Obligations\nNext, we identify each performance obligation in the contract. A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer. Revenue is recognized separately for each performance obligation in the contract. Many of our contracts have one clearly identifiable performance obligation. However, many of our contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more of the following services: engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, repair and maintenance services. For these contracts, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, we generally identify one performance obligation in our contracts. The determination of the number of performance obligations in a contract requires significant judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue recorded for a given period.\nStep 3: Determine Contract Price\nAfter determining the performance obligations in the contract, we determine the contract price. The contract price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer for completing the performance obligation(s). In a fixed-price contract, the contract price is a single lump-sum amount. In reimbursable and time and materials based contracts, the contract price is determined by the agreed upon rates or reimbursements for time and materials expended in completing the performance obligation(s) in the contract.\nA number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that can either increase or decrease the contract price. These variable consideration amounts are generally earned or incurred based on certain performance metrics, most commonly related to project schedule or cost targets. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount of additional consideration to be received (or paid in the case of penalties), provided that meeting the variable condition is probable. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the contract price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the contract price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We reassess the amount of variable consideration each accounting period until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in the assessed amount of variable consideration are accounted for prospectively as a cumulative adjustment to revenue recognized in the current period.\nStep 4: Assign Contract Price to Performance Obligations\nAfter determining the contract price, we assign such price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, we assign the contract price to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices of the distinct services that comprise each performance obligation.\nStep 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nWe record revenue for contracts with our customers as we satisfy the contracts' performance obligations. We recognize revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts for engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. We measure progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion, since it best depicts the transfer of control of assets being created or enhanced to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue over time for reimbursable and time and material based repair and maintenance contracts since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of those services as we perform work under the contract. As a practical expedient allowed under the revenue accounting standards, we record revenue for these contracts in the amount to which we have a right to invoice for the services performed provided that we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date.\nCosts incurred may include direct labor, direct materials, subcontractor costs and indirect costs, such as salaries and benefits, supplies and tools, equipment costs and insurance costs. Indirect costs are charged to projects based upon direct costs and overhead allocation rates per dollar of direct costs incurred or direct labor hours worked. Typically, customer contracts will include standard warranties that provide assurance that products and services will function as expected. We do not sell separate warranties.\nWe have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the forecasted costs at completion. Due to the nature of the work left to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed-price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Estimates of total cost at completion are made each period and changes in these estimates are accounted for prospectively as cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized in the current period. If estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated.\nChange Orders\nContracts are often modified through change orders, which are changes to the agreed upon scope of work. Most of our change orders, which may be priced or unpriced, are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the contract price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. For unpriced change orders, we estimate the increase or decrease to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Unpriced change orders are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nClaims\nSometimes we seek claims for amounts in excess of the contract price for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or other causes of additional costs incurred by us. Recognition of amounts as additional contract price related to claims is appropriate only if there is a legal basis for the claim. The determination of our legal basis for a claim requires significant judgment. We estimate the change to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Claims are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenue for unpriced change orders and claims of $8.9 million at June 30, 2022 and $14.6 million at June 30, 2021. The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. Generally we expect collection of amounts related to unpriced change orders and claims within twelve months. However, customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, which may extend beyond one year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is a level below our reportable segments.\nWe perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or in between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, to determine whether an impairment exists and to determine the amount of headroom. We define \"headroom\" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing management's estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference, but the impairment may not exceed the balance of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and market multiples, referred to as a market approach, to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments and assumptions including forecasted project awards, discount rate, anticipated revenue growth rate, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan. As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our income approach. For the market approach, significant judgments and assumptions include the selection of guideline companies, forecasted guideline company EBITDA and our forecasted EBITDA. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, we also consider the combined fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2022, which resulted in no impairment. The fiscal 2022 test indicated that four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment. If our view of project opportunities or gross margins deteriorates, particularly for the higher risk reporting units, then we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill.\nWe considered the amount of headroom for each reporting unit when determining whether an impairment existed. The amount of headroom varies by reporting unit. Our significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and other factors may change in the future based on the changing economic and competitive environment in which we operate. Assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged, a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom:\n\nIn the third quarter, we concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed based on the decline in the price of our stock and operating results that have underperformed our forecasts during the year. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2022 and concluded that there was $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill, which was recorded as follows:\n\u2022$8.4 million in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment;\n\u2022$7.2 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment; and\n\u2022$2.7 million in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. We believe that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, claims and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or are otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies\u201d. Specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable. We use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known. We believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.", "item_7_tables": "Table 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
