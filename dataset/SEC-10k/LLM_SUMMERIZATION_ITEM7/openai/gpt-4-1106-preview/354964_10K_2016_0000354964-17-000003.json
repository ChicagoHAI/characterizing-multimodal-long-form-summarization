In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC Finance Corporation that are not statements of historical fact and may also constitute forward-looking statements. Words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"would\", \"could\", \"appears\", \"believe\", \"intends\", \"expects\", \"estimates\", \"targeted\", \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"goal\", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but should not be considered as the only means through which these statements may be made. These matters or statements will relate to our future financial condition, economic forecast, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance or business developments and will involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from that which was expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.

Prior to November 15, 2016, HSBC Finance Corporation was owned by HSBC Investments (North America) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which was dissolved. HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") as \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\".\nHistorically we have offered a variety of lending products including real estate secured, personal non-credit card, and auto finance receivables as well as credit cards, private label credit cards and tax refund anticipation loans, all of which we no longer originate. We have also historically offered various types of insurance products.\nOur primary sources of funding in 2016 were proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and real estate owned (\"REO\") sales proceeds. Prior to 2016, we have also borrowed funds from HSBC affiliates as well as received capital contributions as necessary from HSBC which serve as an additional source of funding. We use the cash generated by these funding sources to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our preferred stockholder.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these operations.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Environment The U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during 2016. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") grew at an estimated annual rate of 1.6 percent in 2016, slower than 2015's GDP growth rate of 2.6 percent. Inflation in 2016 continued to run below the Federal Reserve Board's (\"FRB\") 2.0 percent target inflation rate and the FRB has indicated that it currently expects to increase short-term interest rates during 2017. Consumer sentiment in December 2016 improved significantly from the December 2015 levels reflecting an improvement in assessments of current conditions and an increasingly more positive view by consumers of their personal finances. The U.S. economy added approximately 2.2 million jobs during 2016 and the total unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent as of December 2016 as compared with 5.0 percent at December 2015. However, an elevated number of part-time workers continue to seek full-time work and the number of discouraged people who have stopped looking for work remains elevated, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-6 unemployment rate of 9.2 percent at December 2016, as compared with a rate of 9.9 percent at December 2015.\nDespite the continued improvement of the U.S. economy, economic uncertainty remains and the new Administration in the U.S. further adds to this uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical concerns and the regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2017 and beyond.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\n2016 Events\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>As discussed in prior filings, we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost structure as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, in September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. As a result of this decision, we transferred receivables to held for sale with a carrying value of $7,814 million, including accrued interest, at the time of transfer and recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of approximately $541 million. All of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. This decision further accelerated our run-off strategy and, as a result, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded pre-tax expense of $31 million for severance and loan review costs. We will continue to incur loan review costs in future periods as we prepare these receivables for sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During 2016, we sold real estate secured receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $10,130 million (aggregate carrying value of $8,973 million) at the time of sale to third-party investors which included $4,478 million (aggregate carrying value of $4,040 million) that were sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled $9,663 million during 2016. We realized a gain of $633 million, including transaction costs, during 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016 real estate secured receivables held for sale totaled $5.7 billion. While we expect that substantially all of these receivables will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depends on many factors, including future market conditions. We also continue to evaluate various options corresponding to the remaining other assets and liabilities. The ultimate resolution and timing is dependent on several factors.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, we managed our business in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies (\"Group Reporting Basis\") which applied International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU and we reported segment results under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of classifying all remaining receivables as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016, our primary focus has shifted to the successful completion of our receivable sales program. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised the scope and content of our internal management reporting to focus on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") based financial results which more closely reflects the financial performance management is most focused on as receivable sales progress. This U.S. GAAP financial information is used to monitor and review operating results, evaluate trends and make decisions about allocating resources such as employees. As a result of the shift in focus to U.S. GAAP based management reporting, there are no longer any reporting differences between our consolidated results and our segment results. As we only have one segment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in future periods, we no longer report segment results separately for any periods presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. As a result, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million during the second quarter of 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>We previously entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. During the second quarter of 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the Series B preferred shares are no longer outstanding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>In December 2016, our discontinued Card and Retail Services business sold the Class B shares it received in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering (\"Class B Shares\"). Simultaneously, our affiliate, HSBC USA Inc. (\"HSBC USA\"), also sold Class B Shares to the same purchaser. Under the terms of the sale agreement, HSBC USA entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser to retain the litigation risk associated with all of the Class B Shares sold by both us and HSBC USA until the credit card litigation is settled and the Class B Shares can be converted into publicly traded Class A Shares. Immediately following the execution of the sale agreement, we entered into a derivative instrument with HSBC USA to retain the litigation risk associated with our portion of the Class B Shares sold to the purchaser. We recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $44 million as a component of income (loss) from discontinued operations before income tax as a result of these related transactions. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" and Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about these transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Performance, Developments and Trends We reported a net loss of $529 million during 2016 compared with a net loss of $431 million during 2015 and net income of $523 million during 2014. The net loss during 2016 benefited from the sale of the Class B Shares of our discontinued Card and Retail Services business as discussed above. The net loss during 2015 benefited from the reversal of valuation allowances against certain State and local deferred tax assets of $73 million as a result of solely relying on projected future taxable income of HSBC North America in evaluating realizability. Additionally, net loss during 2015 also benefited from the impact of New York City tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $49 million. Net income during 2014 benefited from the impact of New York State tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $55 million.\nLoss from continuing operations was $556 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $394 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations of $547 million during 2014. We reported a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $814 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $865 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations before income tax of $771 million during 2014. The lower loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2016 was driven by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower net interest income. The loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2015 reflects a higher provision for credit losses, higher operating expenses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income.\nOur reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which distort comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(865\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value movement on own fair value option debt attributable to credit spread\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of non-qualifying hedge portfolio\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for securities litigation liability\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to achieve(1)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted performance from continuing operations before income tax(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Costs to achieve reflects transformation costs to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes outlined in the HSBC Investor Update in June 2015.

The improvement was driven by higher other revenues and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and to a lesser extent lower net interest income. Higher other revenues during 2016 reflects an increase of $621 million between years for gains recognized on sales of real estate secured receivables, partially offset by a lower gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives excluding the impact of changes in credit spread and additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2016 on receivables held for sale. Operating expenses declined primarily as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. The higher provision for credit losses during 2016 was driven by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment. The lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for receivables transferred to held for sale in 2016 totaled $576 million which was attributable to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses compared with $234 million during 2015.\nExcluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations during 2015 declined $1,086 million compared with 2014. The decline reflects a significantly higher provision for credit losses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income, partially offset by lower operating expenses. The provision for credit losses in both years was positively impacted by lower loss estimates and improved credit quality, although the impact was more pronounced during 2014. The higher provision for credit losses during 2015 also reflects the transfer of real estate secured receivables to held for sale, which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million that was attributable to credit factors. Lower other revenues largely reflects additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2015 on receivables held for sale compared with reversals of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments during 2014. Operating expenses declined as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs as well as lower fees for consulting services and lower third-party collection fees.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see \"Receivables Review\" for further discussion on our receivable trends, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion on funding and capital and \"Credit Quality\" for additional discussion on our credit trends.\nWe continue to evaluate our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, outstanding debt levels or cost structure in support of HSBC's strategic priorities. Over the past several years, we have taken various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending, outsourcing and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Our focus on cost optimization is continuing and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented.\nFunding and Capital During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not receive any capital contributions. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we retired or called $5,107 million, $6,546 million and $3,524 million, respectively, of term debt and during 2016 we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Our cash requirements in 2016 were met from proceeds of sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs, and REO sales proceeds. For 2017, we expect proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition will generate the liquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations. However, as we continue to execute our receivable sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully repay maturing debt in future periods. As we continue to liquidate our receivable portfolio, HSBC's continued support may be required to properly manage our business operations and maintain appropriate levels of capital. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that it is fully committed and has the capacity and willingness to continue that support.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HSBC Finance Corporation.\nThe significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain critical accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\naccounting estimates on our experience, observable market data and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair values of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on the financial condition or operating performance may be material.\nOf the significant accounting policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies as well as the associated estimates, assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nCredit Loss Reserves Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. Consequently, we historically maintained credit loss reserves that reflected our estimate of probable incurred losses of principal, interest and fees in the portion of our receivable portfolio not classified as held for sale. Loss reserve estimates for these receivables were reviewed periodically and adjustments were reflected through the provision for credit losses in the period they became known.\nIn September 2016, we transferred all of our remaining receivables to held for sale, which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result, we no longer record credit loss reserves on our remaining receivable portfolio. Prior to September 2016, we deemed the accounting estimate relating to the reserve for credit losses to be a \"critical accounting estimate\" for the following reasons:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Changes in the provision could materially affect our financial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Estimates related to this reserve required us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, charge-offs, and, when applicable, collateral which are highly uncertain; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>The reserve for credit losses was influenced by factors outside of our control including customer payment patterns, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment, bankruptcy trends and the effects of laws and regulations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Because estimates of the allowance for credit losses involved judgment and were influenced by factors outside of our control, there was uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible such estimates could change. Our estimate of probable incurred credit losses was inherently uncertain because it was highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions which influenced portfolio seasoning, bankruptcy trends, trends in housing markets, delinquency rates and the flow of receivables through various stages of delinquency, the realizability of any collateral and actual loss experience. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses.\nWe previously estimated probable losses for certain receivables which did not qualify as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR Loans\") using a roll rate migration analysis that estimated the likelihood that a receivable would progress through the various stages of delinquency, or buckets, and ultimately charge-off based upon recent performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporated estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis also considered delinquency status, loss experience and severity and took into account whether borrowers had filed for bankruptcy, receivables had been re-aged or were subject to modification. We also considered the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the receivable in the event of default based on historical and recent trends, which was updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months data using the most recently available information. Delinquency status could be affected by customer account management policies and practices, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. When customer account management policies and practices, or changes thereto, shifted receivables that did not qualify as TDR Loans from a \"higher\" delinquency bucket to a \"lower\" delinquency bucket, this shift was reflected in our roll rate statistics. To the extent that re-aged or modified accounts that did not qualify as TDR Loans had a greater propensity to roll to higher delinquency buckets, this was captured in the roll rates. Since the credit loss reserve was computed based on the composite of all of these calculations, this increase in roll rate was applied to receivables in all respective delinquency buckets, which increased the overall reserve level.\nIn addition, loss reserves on receivables held for investment were previously maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors that may not be fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation or when historical trends were not reflective of current inherent losses in the portfolio. Portfolio risk factors previously considered in establishing loss reserves on receivables included product mix, unemployment rates, the credit performance of modified receivables, loan product features such as adjustable rate loans, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets and interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations and other factors that could affect consumer payment patterns on outstanding receivables, such as natural disasters. Another portfolio risk factor we considered was the credit performance of\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncertain second lien receivables following more delinquent first lien receivables which we own or service. Once we determined that such a second lien receivable was likely to progress to charge off, the loss severity assumed in establishing our credit loss reserves was close to 100 percent. At December 31, 2015, approximately 3 percent of our second lien mortgages held for investment, for which the first lien mortgage was held or serviced by us and had a delinquency status of 90 days or more delinquent were less than 90 days delinquent, and not considered to be a troubled debt restructuring or already recorded at fair value less cost to sell.\nWe also considered key ratios such as reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables and reserves as a percentage of receivables in developing our loss reserve estimate. The results from our reserving process were reviewed each quarter by the Credit Reserve Committee. This committee also considered other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided adequately included all known information at each reporting period. Our Risk and Finance departments previously shared responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of credit loss reserves inherent in our receivable portfolio and they assessed and independently approved our credit loss reserves.\nReserves against receivables modified in troubled debt restructurings were previously determined primarily by analysis of discounted expected cash flows and in certain cases was based on independent valuations of the underlying receivable collateral.\nFor more information about our charge-off and customer account management policies and practices, see \"Credit Quality - Delinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices,\" and \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices,\" in this MD&A.\nValuation of Financial Instruments We have established a control framework which is designed to ensure that fair values are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the determination of fair values rests with Finance. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee, a management committee comprised of senior executives in the Finance, Risk and other functions within HSBC North America, meets monthly to review, monitor and discuss significant valuation matters arising from credit and market risks. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWhere available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is measured using internally developed valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from and corroborated by market data or obtained from reputable third-party vendors. All of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value on a recurring basis are measured based on quoted market prices or observable independently-sourced market-based inputs. Where neither quoted market prices nor observable market parameters are available, fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management's expectation of the inputs that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. However, these unobservable inputs must incorporate market participants' assumptions about risks in the asset or liability and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear the risks. The determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment.\nWe review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs into a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a more detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, see \"Fair Value,\" in this MD&A.\nSignificant assets and liabilities recorded at fair value include the following:\nReceivables held for sale - Receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The estimated fair value of our receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources appropriate for the respective pools of assets aggregated by similar risk characteristics. These sources include recently observed over-the-counter transactions where available and fair value estimates obtained from an HSBC affiliate and a third party valuation specialist for distinct pools of receivables. These fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flow models using assumptions we believe are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such receivables and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades. Our valuation of receivables held for sale is based on aggregated pools of receivables to be sold by similar risk characteristics. The valuation of the receivables held for sale could be impacted in future periods if there are changes in how we expect to execute the receivable sales.\nValuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by investors in the current market given the specific characteristics and inherent credit risk of the receivables held for sale. Some of these inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. We perform analytical reviews of fair value changes on a quarterly basis and periodically validate our valuation methodologies and assumptions based on the results of actual sales of such receivables. We also may hold discussions on\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nvalue directly with potential investors. Since some receivables pools may have unique features, the fair value measurement process uses significant unobservable inputs specific to the performance characteristics of the various receivable portfolios.\nChanges in inputs, in particular in the rate of return that investors would require to purchase assets with the same characteristics and of the same credit quality, could significantly change the carrying amount of the receivables held for sale and related fair value adjustment recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a one percent decline in collateral values, based either on a current broker price opinion or the current estimated property value derived from the property's appraised value at the time of origination updated by a pricing index based on appropriate geographical data (such as the Case-Shiller Home Price Index), coupled with a one percent increase in the rate of return for real estate secured receivables held for sale would have resulted in an estimated decrease of the fair value of real estate secured receivables held for sale of approximately $250 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion including the valuation inputs used in valuing receivables held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities - We regularly use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy to protect future cash flows. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Related collateral that has been received or paid is netted against fair value for financial reporting purposes in those circumstances in which a master netting arrangement with the counterparty exists that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default or termination of any one contract. We believe that the valuation of derivative instruments is a critical accounting estimate because these instruments are valued using discounted cash flow modeling techniques or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity in lieu of observable market value quotes for identical or similar assets or liabilities in active and inactive markets. These modeling techniques require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows and use independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, when available. The valuation models and inputs are developed, reviewed, validated and approved by the Markets Independent Model Review Team of an HSBC affiliate. The models used apply appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure that the derived inputs are used to value only those instruments that share similar risk to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors.\nWe may adjust certain fair value estimates determined using valuation models to ensure that those estimates appropriately represent fair value. These adjustments, which are applied consistently over time, reflect factors such as the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Because of the interrelated nature, we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, model and data uncertainty risks. We also adjust fair value estimates determined using valuation models for counterparty credit risk and our own non-performance risk.\nWe utilize HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, \"HSBC Bank USA\") to determine the fair value of all of our derivatives using these modeling techniques. Significant changes in the fair value can result in equity and earnings volatility as follows:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge are first recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, then recorded in earnings along with the cash flow effects of the hedged item. Ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has not been designated or ceases to qualify as an effective hedge are reported in earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A control framework has been established which is designed to ensure that fair values are validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the measurement of fair values rests with the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWe test effectiveness for all derivatives designated as hedges under the \"long haul\" method both at inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis, to ascertain whether the derivative used in a hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment is conducted using statistical regression analysis. If we determine that a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting as of the beginning of the quarter in which such determination was made. We also believe the assessment of the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions is a critical accounting estimate due to the use of statistical regression analysis in making this determination. Inputs to statistical regression analysis require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are susceptible to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates as well as the selection of a convention for the treatment of credit spreads in the analysis. Statistical regression analysis also involves the use of additional assumptions including the\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndetermination of the period over which the analysis should occur. The statistical regression analysis for our derivative instruments is performed by HSBC Bank USA.\nThe outcome of the statistical regression analysis can result in earnings volatility as the mark-to-market on derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges and the ineffectiveness associated with qualifying hedges are recorded in earnings. For example, a 10 percent adverse change in the value of our derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges would have reduced gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives by approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor more information about our policies regarding the use of derivative instruments, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" and Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term debt carried at fair value - We have elected the fair value option for certain issuances of our fixed rate debt in order to align our accounting treatment with that of HSBC. Valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value both the interest rate component and the credit component of the debt. In many cases, management can obtain quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities but the markets may not be active, the prices may not be current, or such price quotations may differ substantially either over time or among market makers. Changes in such estimates, and in particular the credit component of the valuation, can be volatile from period to period and may impact the total mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value recorded in our consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in interest rates across all terms would have increased our reported mark-to-market by approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credits and net operating and other losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, totaled $2,897 million and $2,923 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback available. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate.\nWe are included in HSBC North America's consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and in various combined State tax returns. We have entered into a tax allocation agreement with HSBC North America and its subsidiary entities which governs the current amount of taxes to be paid or received by the various entities and, therefore, we look at HSBC North America and its affiliates in reaching conclusions on recoverability. Based on our forecasts of future taxable income, we currently anticipate that HSBC North America's operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets.\nThe use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will affect taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance.\nOur interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate.\nThe carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is also determined by the enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate. Consequently, any changes in the U.S. corporate income tax rate will impact the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset. The new Administration in the U.S. has indicated an interest in significantly reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. Because we do not yet know the details of the new Administration's corporate tax plan, it is not possible to quantify the one-time impact from a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might ultimately result upon tax reform enactment. However, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could result in a decrease in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and a reduction to our net income and\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ntotal equity during the period in which any tax rate change is enacted. For example, a hypothetical 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 34 percent at December 31, 2016 would result in a write-down of our net deferred tax asset of approximately $80 million.\nAdditional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 can be found in Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nContingent Liabilities Both we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. Certain of these activities are or purport to be class actions seeking damages in significant amounts. These actions include assertions concerning violations of laws and/or unfair treatment of consumers. We have also been subject to various governmental and regulatory proceedings.\nWe estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from those estimates. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nLitigation and regulatory exposure is a critical accounting estimate because it represents key areas of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control. Due to the inherent uncertainties and other factors involved in such matters, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately prevail in each instance. Such uncertainties impact our ability to determine whether it is probable that a liability exists and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Also, as the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is influenced by factors that are outside of our control, it is reasonably possible our estimated liability under these proceedings may change. We will continue to update our accruals for these legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings as facts and circumstances change. See Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables Review\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increases (Decreases) From\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,854\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables held for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,411\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables held for sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,591\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal estate secured receivables held for investment The decrease since December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily reflects the decision to expand our receivable sales program in June 2015 and the decision in September 2016 to transfer all receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. To a lesser extent the decrease as compared with both periods also reflects continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. Liquidation rates in our real estate secured receivable portfolio continued to be impacted by low receivable prepayments as few refinancing opportunities exist for our customers.\nReceivables held for sale The decrease since December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of receivable sales during 2016 with a carrying value of $8,973 million, partially offset by the transfer of all receivables to held for sale during September 2016 as discussed above. The increase in receivables held for sale since December 31, 2014 reflects the changes to our receivable sales program in June 2015 and September 2016 as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of receivable sales during 2016 and 2015 with a carrying value of $8,973 million and $1,995 million, respectively. To a lesser extent, the increase was also partially offset by continued liquidation in the portfolio as well as the impact of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments.\nIn response to the financial crisis, lenders have significantly tightened underwriting standards, substantially limiting the availability of alternative and subprime mortgages. As fewer financing options currently exist in the marketplace for home buyers, properties in certain markets are remaining on the market for longer periods of time which contributes to home price depreciation. For many of our customers, the ability to refinance and access equity in their homes is no longer an option. These industry trends continue to impact our portfolio and are reflected in additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of receivables held for sale, including a rollforward of the receivable held for sale balance for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we continue to make progress in our strategy to sell our real estate secured receivable portfolio, we will see declines in net interest income.

The provision for credit losses in both 2016 and 2015 was impacted by the recording of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments related to credit factors on receivables transferred to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in 2016 as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio. These adjustments reflect the differences between amortized cost and the amount we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivables, which takes into consideration factors that are not relevant under the incurred loss model in establishing credit loss reserves for receivables held for investment, such as life time losses and the discounting of cash flows. When there is no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors are present, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of provision for credit losses.\nThe remainder of the provision for credit losses was also higher during 2016 as compared with 2015. While both periods were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels and the impact of lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days delinquent, as well as lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, the impact was more pronounced during 2015. Additionally, the provision for credit losses during 2015 was also impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio.\nNet charge-off dollars totaled $932 million during 2016 compared with $2,156 million during 2015. Dollars of net charge-offs during both periods were impacted by lower receivable levels subsequent to the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of the transfer of receivables to held for sale are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled $268 million during 2016 compared with $1,622 million during 2015.

Excluding the impact of charge-off dollars associated with receivables transferred to held for sale during both periods, dollars of net charge-offs decreased during 2016 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices during 2016. See \"Credit Quality\" for further discussion of our net charge-offs.\nSubsequent to the transfer of receivables to held for sale, no further provision for credit losses or charge-offs are recorded as receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result of transferring all the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no provision for credit losses or charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe following discusses our provision for credit losses by product for 2015 as compared with 2014:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>The provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables increased during 2015 largely due to the impact of our expanded receivable sales program which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million related to credit factors as discussed above. Excluding the impact of this item, the provision for credit losses remained higher during 2015. Both 2015 and 2014 were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels, lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, and improved credit quality, including lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent, although the impact to the provision for credit losses was more pronounced during 2014.

These financial instruments were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. In May 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges.\nDerivative related expense deteriorated during 2016 compared with 2015.

Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased during 2016 primarily due to lower net realized gains as a result of fewer derivative positions during the year as our fair value option debt and related derivatives mature as well as a tightening of our credit spreads. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives improved modestly during 2015 as a result of the impact of a widening of our credit spreads during 2015 and the impact of changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term, partially offset by lower realized gains on the related derivatives as a result of fewer derivative positions as discussed above. See Note 9, \"Fair Value Option,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information, including a break out of the components of the gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives.\nNet income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. The gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nServicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates represents revenue received under service level agreements under which we service real estate secured receivables as well as rental revenue from HSBC Technology & Services (USA) Inc.

Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. This was partially offset by the impact of settlements resulting from receivable payoffs or the transfer of receivables to REO totaling $62 million. During 2015, we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale totaling $130 million of which $155 million related to changes in fair value and $25 million related to settlements.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.\nGain on sale of real estate secured receivables increased during 2016 and decreased during 2015.

The increase in 2016 also reflects improved pricing during the year, particularly during the fourth quarter.\nOther income decreased during 2016 and increased during 2015. All periods were impacted by changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities. Excluding the impact of changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities from all periods, other income was essentially flat during 2016 and 2015.\nOur reserve for potential repurchase liability represents our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred resulting from various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our receivable sales. Because the level of receivable repurchase losses are dependent upon strategies for bringing claims or pursuing legal action for losses incurred, the level of the liability for receivables repurchase losses requires significant judgment. As such, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates making it reasonably possible that they could change. During the third quarter of 2015, management concluded that, due to new developments in case law and other factors, it was appropriate to release the repurchase reserve liability related to receivables sold by Decision One Mortgage Company LLC prior to the third quarter of 2007. The following table summarizes the changes in our reserve for potential repurchase liability related to our receivable sales:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in liability recorded through earnings\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses.

Salary and employee benefits in both 2016 and 2015 were impacted by severance costs resulting from changes in our receivable sales program in September 2016 and June 2015, respectively. Severance costs during 2016 totaled $21 million compared with $34 million in 2015.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, net decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as a result of the sale of a data center during the third quarter of 2015 as discussed above as well as lower rent, repair and utility costs reflecting the impact of the continuing reduced scope of our business operations.\nReal estate owned expenses decreased during 2016 driven by fewer average numbers of REO properties held during the year. Additionally, REO expenses in 2015 benefited from an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million as discussed below. During 2016, we brought the servicing of our entire REO portfolio in-house.\nReal estate owned expenses were impacted during 2015 by an adjustment to the final charge-off calculation at the time of foreclosure for certain receivables in prior periods. This resulted in an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million when the REO properties associated with these receivables were sold. Excluding the impact of this item, REO expenses increased during 2015 driven by lower gains on sales of REO properties during 2015 as a result of a significant decrease in the number of REO properties sold during 2015. The increase in 2015 was partially offset by the impact of lower estimated losses due to continuing improvements in the housing market in 2015 and lower holding costs due to fewer average numbers of REO properties held during 2015 and lower costs per property.\nSupport services from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower technology costs from an HSBC affiliate and lower fees for receivable servicing by HSBC affiliates as a result of the sale of receivables during 2016 and 2015. The decrease during 2016 also reflects the impact of terminating a guarantee during the third quarter of 2015 related to a surety bond.\nProvision for securities litigation liability As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million and $700 million, respectively.\nOther expenses decreased during 2016 reflecting lower litigation costs as well as the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in file review costs related to our receivable sales program.\nOther expenses increased during 2015 reflecting the impact of higher litigation costs, partially offset by lower fees for consulting services as well as lower third-party collection fees resulting from lower foreclosure activities as we have fewer receivables in the\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nprocess of foreclosure as a result of the receivable sales program. Other expenses in 2015 was also positively impacted by the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs.\nIncome taxes Our effective tax rate was (31.7) percent in 2016 compared with (54.5) percent in 2015 and 29.1 percent in 2014. For a complete analysis of the differences between effective tax rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pre-tax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate, see Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations intended to discourage corporate inversions by re-characterizing certain inter-company debt as equity, effectively eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid to related parties under certain circumstances. Final and temporary regulations were released in October 2016 that exempt regulated financial groups such as HSBC and its affiliates from those re-characterization rules. Certain documentation rules included in the regulations will apply to HSBC and its affiliates, and we will analyze the requirements in order to implement the regulations on a timely basis in accordance with the rules. We do not anticipate a significant financial accounting impact upon implementation of the regulations.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Quality\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Loss Reserves As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. As a result, our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale which is carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer has any associated credit loss reserves as any adjustments to the carrying value are reflected in other income. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in this MD&A and Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on our policies for establishing credit loss reserves prior to September 2016.\nThe table below sets forth credit loss reserves and credit loss reserve ratios for the historical periods indicated. The transfer to held for sale of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment in September 2016 has resulted in our entire receivable portfolio being carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer have any associated credit loss reserves. Transfers of receivables to held for sale impacts comparability between credit loss reserves and the related reserve ratios between periods.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserves(1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserve ratios:(2)(3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves as a percentage of receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, credit loss reserves includes $12 million, $33 million, $52 million and $132 million, respectively, related to receivables held for investment which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell primarily reflecting an estimate of additional loss following an interior appraisal of the property.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reserves associated with accrued finance charges, which totaled $51 million, $323 million, $326 million and $360 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are reported within our total credit loss reserve balances noted above, although receivables and nonaccrual receivables as reported generally exclude accrued finance charges.

Credit loss reserves associated with all receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale during 2015 totaled $1,622 million and were recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale. Credit loss reserves at December 31, 2015 were also positively impacted by lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2014 decreased as compared with December 31, 2013 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2014 due to lower levels of TDR Loans as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional real estate secured receivables during 2014 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $58 million during 2014 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2013 decreased as compared with December 31, 2012 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2013 due to lower levels of new TDR Loan volumes as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional pools of real estate secured receivables during 2013 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $164 million during 2013 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserve ratios Following is a discussion of changes in the reserve ratios we previously considered in establishing reserve levels. As discussed above, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale and we no longer have any credit loss reserves. Accordingly, there are no credit loss reserve ratios at December 31, 2016.\nReserves as a percentage of receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015 decreased significantly as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables as the majority of the receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as part of the expansion of the receivable sales program were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2014 as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, largely due to the lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans and improved credit quality as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in receivables. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2013 as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables.\nReserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables held for investment were impacted by nonaccrual real estate secured receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2015 decreased as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables as the majority of the nonaccrual receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as discussed above were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2014 were higher as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in nonaccrual receivables, as discussed more fully below, outpaced the decrease in credit loss reserves. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2013 were lower as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, driven by the lower reserve requirement for TDR Loans as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables.\nSee Note 6, \"Credit Loss Reserves,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit loss reserves by product for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices Our delinquency and net charge-off ratios reflect, among other factors, changes in the quality of our receivables, transfers of receivables to held for sale, the average age of our receivables, the success of our collection and customer account management efforts, general economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment rates, any changes to our charge-off policies and significant catastrophic events such as natural disasters and global pandemics. See Note 2,\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our charge-off and nonaccrual policies.\nDelinquency Our policies and practices for the collection of receivables, including our customer account management policies and practices, permit us to modify the terms of receivables, either temporarily or permanently (a \"modification\"), and/or to reset the contractual delinquency status of an account that is contractually delinquent to current (a \"re-age\"), based on indicators or criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability. Such policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure or repossession as determined to be appropriate. If a re-aged account subsequently experiences payment defaults, it will again become contractually delinquent and be included in our delinquency ratios.\nThe table below summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency for receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percent of receivables and receivables held for sale (\"delinquency ratio\"). As previously discussed, in June 2015 we expanded our receivable sales program and in September 2016 we transferred all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale which must be considered in comparing dollars of contractual delinquency and the delinquency ratio between the periods presented.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars of contractual delinquency(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late stage delinquency(2)(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Individually evaluated for impairment(4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collectively evaluated for impairment(5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate secured receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for sale(6)\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquency ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late stage delinquency\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Individually evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collectively evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate secured receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for sale\n</td> <td>8.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>8.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The receivables held for investment balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables.

The increase as compared to December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of real estate secured receivable sales during 2016 as a significant portion of the receivables sold were less than 30 days contractually delinquent which results in receivables held for sale decreasing at a faster pace than dollars of delinquency. Additionally, the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio in September 2016 also impacts the comparability of the delinquency ratio between periods.\nSee \"Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" regarding the delinquency treatment of re-aged and modified accounts.\nNet Charge-offs The following table summarizes net charge-off of receivables both in dollars and as a percent of average receivables (\"net charge-off ratio\"). During a quarter in which receivables are transferred to receivables held for sale, those receivables continue to be included in the average receivable balances prior to such transfer and any charge-off related to those receivables prior to such transfer, including the recognition of existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer and the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment, if any, remain in our net charge-off totals. However, in the quarter following the transfer to held for sale classification, the receivables are no longer included in average receivables as such receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and, accordingly, there are no further charge-offs associated with these receivables.

As a result of transferring all of the remaining receivables held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no additional charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe net real estate secured receivable charge-off ratio for 2016 increased as compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above.\nReal estate charge-offs and REO expenses as a percentage of average real estate secured receivables for 2016 increased compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by the impact of lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above and lower REO expenses.

Our customer account management policies and practices permit us to take action with respect to delinquent or troubled accounts based on criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability, as well as a continuing desire for borrowers to stay in their homes. The policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate. From time to time we re-evaluate these policies and procedures and make changes as deemed appropriate.\nCurrently, we utilize the following account management actions:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Modification - Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable either temporarily or permanently without changing the delinquency status of the receivable. Modifications may include changes to one or more terms of the receivable including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, extension of the amortization period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Collection Re-age - Management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an account to current but does not involve any changes to the original terms and conditions of the receivable. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent.

It must be able to fund its operations, service its debt obligations and pay dividends to its preferred stockholder. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock in 2016 or 2015. We maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process.\nHSBC Finance Corporation manages all of its operations directly and in 2016, funded these businesses primarily through proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and REO sales proceeds.\nAt various times, we make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support operations or provide funding for long-term facilities and technological improvements. During 2016 and 2015, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries were more than offset by dividends paid to HSBC Finance Corporation.\nHSBC Related Funding We work with our affiliates under the oversight of HSBC North America to maximize funding opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC's operations in the United States. All of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and our funding requirements are sourced primarily through HSBC USA or HSBC North America.\nDue to affiliates totaled $3,300 million and $5,925 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The interest rates on funding from HSBC subsidiaries are market-based and comparable to those available from unaffiliated parties.\nIn July 2016, we prepaid a $600 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In October 2016, we prepaid a $1,000 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In December 2016, we prepaid $512 million that was outstanding under a credit agreement with HSBC USA.\nSee Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our funding arrangements with HSBC affiliates, including derivatives.\nShort-Term Investments Securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled $2,392 million and $2,724 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Interest bearing deposits at banks totaled $1,500 million at December 31, 2016 and were with HSBC Bank USA. We did not have any interest bearing deposits at banks at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments increased as compared with December 31, 2015 reflecting cash received from receivable sales, partially offset by the retirement of debt, payment of the securities litigation settlement and the redemption of the Series B preferred stock.\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt (excluding amounts due to affiliates) decreased to $4,340 million at December 31, 2016 from $9,510 million at December 31, 2015. There were no issuances of long-term debt during 2016 or 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $5,107 million and $6,546 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSecured financings previously issued under public trusts of $404 million at December 31, 2016 are secured by $750 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016. Secured financings previously issued under public trusts of $879 million at December 31, 2015 were secured by $1,654 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015.\nIn order to eliminate future foreign exchange risk, currency swaps were used at the time of issuance of all foreign-denominated notes to fix the notes in U.S. dollars.\nWe have used derivatives for managing interest rate and currency risk and have received loan commitments from affiliates, but we do not otherwise enter into off-balance sheet transactions.\nPreferred Stock In November 2010, we issued 1,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to an affiliate for $1.0 billion. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and payable quarterly at a rate of 8.625 percent. During years in which there is an accumulated deficit, dividends on the Series C preferred stock are paid from additional paid-in-capital. The Series C preferred stock may be redeemed at our option after November 30, 2025.\nIn June 2005, we issued 575,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $575 million. On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million.\nSee Note 12, \"Redeemable Preferred Stock,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommon Equity During 2016 and 2015, we did not receive any capital contributions.\nEquity ratio Common and preferred equity to total assets totaled 39.14 percent at December 31, 2016 compared with 27.48 percent at December 31, 2015.\nHSBC North America continues to review the composition of its capital structure following the adoption by the U.S. banking regulators of the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which were effective as of January 1, 2014. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, we have replaced instruments whose treatment was less favorable under the new rules with Basel III compliant instruments. Any required funding has been, or will be, integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates.\nHSBC North America participates in the FRB's CCAR program and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run stress test results in April 2016. In June 2016, the FRB informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2016 CCAR submission. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity.\n2017 Funding Strategy The following table summarizes our current range of estimates for funding needs and sources for 2017:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding Needs and Sources for 2017\n</td> <td>Minimum\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Maximum\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in billions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding needs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured debt maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short term investments\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total funding needs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding sources:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivable sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total funding sources\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Primarily reflects miscellaneous cash provided by operating activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For 2017, we expect proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition will generate the\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nliquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures in 2016 and 2015 totaled $1 million and $1 million, respectively.

Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.\nFair Value Hierarchy Accounting principles related to fair value measurements establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the \"Fair Value Framework\"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy:\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>whether the instrument is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price that is readily available;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the size of transactions occurring in an active market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the level of bid-ask spreads;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, market liquidity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>whether the inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for the identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume.\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We generally classify derivative contracts as well as our own debt issuance for which we have elected fair value option as Level 2 measurements. These valuations are typically obtained from a third party valuation source which, in the case of derivatives, includes valuations provided by HSBC Bank USA.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis totaling $5,674 million (41 percent of total assets) and $8,265 million (34 percent of total assets), respectively. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nClassification within the fair value hierarchy is based on whether the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. As such, the classification within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic and can be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period. Transfers between leveling categories are assessed, determined and recognized at the end of each reporting period.\nSee Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details including our valuation techniques as well as the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Additionally, see Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 measurements during 2016 and 2015.\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. To do so, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. This framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also ensures that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. We strive to continuously improve our risk management processes through ongoing employee training and development.\nOur risk management framework is underpinned by a strong risk culture and reinforced by our values and standards. These are instrumental in aligning the behaviors of individuals with our attitude to assuming and managing risk and ensuring that our risk profile remains in line with our risk appetite. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that ensures appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk.\nOur Board of Directors and its committees, principally the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committees, have oversight responsibility for the effective management of risk. The Risk Committee advises the Board of Directors on our business run-off strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters.\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement is accountable for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of our risk management policies. Day-to-day risk management activities are the responsibility of senior managers of individual businesses, supported by HSBC global functions. We use the Three Lines of Defense (\"LoD\") model to underpin our approach to strong risk management. It defines who is responsible to do what to identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor, and mitigate risks, encouraging collaboration and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to risk ownership and risk management. Decisions are not taken by committees, but by specific individuals, in accordance with the Three LoD model, to promote clear accountability. The Board and its sub-committees remain collective decision-making bodies. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model.\nOur Risk Management function is headed by our Chief Risk Officer, who is responsible for the risk management framework. This includes establishing policies, monitoring of risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management policies resides with the Chief Risk Officer supported by the Risk Management Meeting (\"RMM\") of the HSBC Finance Corporation Executive Committee (\"EXCO\"). EXCO is the senior most management committee at HSBC Finance Corporation and the RMM is its meeting to discuss risk matters.\nSpecific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following HSBC North America or Risk Committees:\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the HSBC North America Asset Liability Committee (\"HSBC North America ALCO\");\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the Operational Risk Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the HSBC North America Third Party Risk Oversight Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the HSBC North America Capital Management Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the Regulatory Compliance Governance Committee; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the Financial Crime Compliance (\"FCC\") Governance Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities as it relates to risk oversight.\nHSBC North America ALCO provides oversight of all liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the HSBC North America Chief Financial Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are members of the HSBC North America ALCO. Subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and HSBC Group, the HSBC North America ALCO advises the Chief Financial Officer of HSBC North America in setting the limits of acceptable risk, monitoring the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assessing the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. The HSBC North America ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity.\nMaintaining a conservative risk profile is a core part of our philosophy. This encompasses maintaining a strong capital position and having effective liquidity and funding management. Additionally, we have zero tolerance for the following:\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>operating without the appropriate systems and controls in place to prevent and detect financial crime;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers arising from our operations or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by our operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The principal risks associated with our operations include the following:\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to rate movements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events (including legal risk);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us.

In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract. Day-to-day management of credit risk is administered by our Retail Chief Credit Officer with ultimate reporting responsibility to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, to the Risk Committee of the HSBC North America Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group Chief Risk Officer. Our credit and portfolio management procedures currently focus on effective collections and customer account management efforts, in addition to supporting disciplined execution of the receivable sales program. Our customer account management policies and practices are described under the caption \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" in this MD&A. Also see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our policies surrounding credit loss reserves. Our policies and procedures are consistent with HSBC Group standards and are regularly reviewed and updated both on an HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC level. The credit risk function continues to refine \"early warning\" indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of current experience. These risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process.\nCredit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business and risk management functions to ensure that our receivable portfolio is managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Charter is endorsed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee, and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Board of Directors will have oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews.\nCounterparty credit risk is our primary exposure on our currency swap portfolio. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of our existing currency swap derivative contracts are with HSBC Bank USA. The fair value of our agreements with\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHSBC Bank USA required us to provide collateral to the affiliate of $317 million at December 31, 2016 and $491 million at December 31, 2015, all of which was provided in cash.\nSee Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to interest rate risk management and Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nLiquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself. Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to fund our assets and meet commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. The primary driver of our liquidity going forward will be sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition. However, as we continue to execute our receivables sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. We currently do not expect third-party debt to be a source of funding for us in the future given the run-off nature of our business. Any required incremental funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plan and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or will be obtained through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has indicated it remains fully committed and has the capacity to continue to provide such support.\nHSBC North America maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan, which identifies certain potential early indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on its businesses. The liquidity contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators is monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, widening of our credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. In the event of a cash flow crisis, our objective is to fund cash requirements without HSBC affiliate access to the wholesale unsecured funding market for at least 90 days. Contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through liquidation of short term investments, sale of receivables or secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. We maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash and short-term liquid assets.\nWe project cash flow requirements and determine the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated balance sheet run-off, including liquidation of receivables held for sale, contingent liabilities and the ability of HSBC USA to access wholesale funding markets.\nPrior to 2016, we employed stressed coverage ratios to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. Stressed coverage ratios, incorporating HSBC-specific stress scenarios, were used to monitor the resilience to severe liquidity stresses. Beginning in 2016, HSBC replaced these stressed coverage ratios with the Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\"LCR\") as discussed below. As a result, we now employ this ratio as part of our approach to liquidity risk management.\nThe Basel Committee based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard beginning in 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our LCR ratio under the EU LCR rule was significantly in excess of 100 percent. A LCR ratio of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets.\nIn September 2014, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the U.S., applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR final rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that will qualify as high-quality liquid assets and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the final rule, U.S. institutions began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. The LCR final rule does not address the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America may need to make further changes to its liquidity profile to support compliance with any future final rules. HSBC Finance Corporation may need to adjust its liquidity profile to support HSBC North America's compliance with these rules, but it is not anticipated to significantly impact our operations.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") issued final standards for total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") requirements for global systemically important banks (\"G-SIBs\"), which will apply to our ultimate parent HSBC once implemented in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \"internal\" TLAC to be prepositioned (issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, to be fully phased in January 1, 2022. In the United States, the FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the U.S. in December 2016. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. intermediate holding companies of non-US G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework that may require HSBC North America to issue additional long-term debt.\nAs indicated by the major rating agencies, our credit ratings are directly dependent upon the continued support of HSBC. A credit rating downgrade would increase future borrowing costs only for new debt obligations, if any. As discussed above, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that they remain fully committed and have the capacity to continue that support.\nThe following table summarizes our credit ratings at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Standard &\nPoor's\nCorporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\nInvestors\nService\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior debt\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior subordinated debt\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.\nIn March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nIn July 2016, Standard & Poor's Corporation (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the EU. As a result, S&P changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S&P affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nAlthough we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be changed in the future. As of December 31, 2016, there were no pending actions from these rating agencies in terms of changes to the ratings presented in the table above for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nOther conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include unforeseen capital requirements, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would require us to post additional collateral for our cross currency swaps, a slowdown in the rate of attrition of our balance sheet and an inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC and its subsidiaries.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion of our liquidity position.\nMarket Risk Management The objective of our market risk management process is to manage and control market risk exposures in order to optimize return on risk. Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios. Market risk is managed by the HSBC North America Head of Market Risk.\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe maintain an overall risk management strategy that primarily uses standard, over-the-counter cross currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps.\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps. Our financial statements are affected by movements in exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated debt.\nInterest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses due to rate movements. We use simulation models to measure the impact of anticipated changes in interest rates on net interest income and execute appropriate risk management actions. The key assumptions used in these models include projected balance sheet attrition, cash flows from a certain derivative financial instrument and changes in market conditions. While these assumptions are based on our best estimates of future conditions, we cannot precisely predict our earnings due to the uncertainty inherent in the economic environment. Historically we have used derivative financial instruments, principally standard, over-the-counter interest rate swaps, to manage these exposures.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is also changing as the balance sheet declines and a growing percentage of our remaining real estate receivables are modified and/or re-aged. Prior to the credit crisis, real estate receivables had original contractual maturities of 30 years but active customer refinancing resulted in a much shorter duration of three years. Debt was typically issued in intermediate and longer term maturities (5 to 10 years) to maximize the liquidity benefit. The interest rate risk created by combining short duration assets with long duration liabilities was reduced historically by entering into hedge positions that reduced the duration of the liabilities portfolio.\nThe duration assumption for our fixed rate real estate secured receivable portfolio is estimated to be 3.8 years at December 31, 2016 reflecting the impact of a higher percentage of receivables staying on our balance sheet longer than prior to the credit crisis due to the impact of modification programs and/or lack of refinancing alternatives. At the same time, the duration of our liability portfolio continues to decline due to the passage of time and the absence of new long-term debt issuance.\nA principal part of our management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modeling). We aim, through our management of interest rate risk, to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while weighing the cost of hedging activities on the current net revenue stream.\nNet interest income simulation modeling techniques are utilized to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various rate shock scenarios, such as scenarios in which rates rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period as well as the impact of an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve. The following table reflects the impact on projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve (reflects projected quarterly rate movements of 25 basis points at the beginning of each quarter)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (reflects projected quarterly rate movements of 25 basis points at the beginning of each quarter)\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs compared with December 31, 2015, the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate rise and the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate reduction reflect updates of economic stress scenarios including housing price index assumptions, regular adjustments of asset and liability behavior assumptions, run-off of the balance sheet and model enhancements.\nA principal consideration underlying the projected net interest income at risk analysis is the projected prepayment of receivable balances for a given economic scenario. Individual loan underwriting standards in combination with housing valuations, receivable modification programs, changes to our foreclosure processes and macroeconomic factors related to available mortgage credit are the key assumptions driving these prepayment projections. While we have utilized a number of sources to refine these projections,\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwe cannot currently project precise prepayment rates with a high degree of certainty in all economic environments given post crisis, significant changes in both subprime mortgage underwriting standards and property valuations across the country.\nThe projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.\nOperational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (including legal risk). Operational risk is relevant to every aspect of our business and covers a wide spectrum of risks. Our strategy is to manage operational risks in a cost effective manner, within targeted levels consistent with the risk appetite. Our Operational Risk Management Framework (\"ORMF\") ensures minimum standards of governance and organization over operational risk and internal control throughout HSBC Finance Corporation and covers all our businesses and operations (including all activities, processes and systems). During 2016, our risk profile was dominated by compliance and legal risks. The incidence of and response to regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial services firms is significant. We have prioritized resources to develop and execute remedial actions to regulatory matters, including enhancing or adding internal controls and we closely monitor the possible impacts of litigation on our operational risk profile.\nWe have established an independent operational risk management discipline in the U.S. which is led by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The mission of the Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, is to provide governance and strategic oversight of the ORMF, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and appetite of operational risk. Selected results and reports from this committee are communicated to the RMM and subsequently to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Management in the First LoD is responsible for managing and controlling operational risk. In addition, the central operational risk function, in conjunction with the other second line subject matter experts, provides functional oversight by coordinating the following activities:\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u009f\n</td> <td>developing operational risk management policies and procedures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> \u009f\n</td> <td>developing and managing methodologies and tools to support the identification, assessment, and monitoring of operational risks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>providing firm-wide operational risk and control reporting;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>identifying emerging risks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>analyzing root-cause of large operational risk losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>providing operational risk training and awareness programs for employees throughout the firm;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>communicating with the First LoD, including Business Risk and Control Managers, to ensure the ORMF is executed within their respective business or function;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>independently reviewing the operational risk and control assessments, communicating results to management and monitoring remedial actions that may be necessary to improve the assessments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>modeling operational risk losses and scenarios for capital management purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Management of operational risk includes identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation, rectification, and reporting of the results of risk events, including losses and compliance with local regulatory requirements. These key components of the ORMF have been communicated by issuance of HSBC standards and procedures. Details and local application of the standards have been documented and communicated by issuance of a U.S. Operational Risk Policy. Key elements of the policy and our ORMF include:\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>business and function management is responsible for the assessment, identification, management, and reporting of their operational risks and monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of key controls;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>material risks are assigned an overall risk prioritization / rating based on the typical and severe assessments and considers the direct financial costs and the indirect impacts to the business. An assessment of the effectiveness of key controls that mitigate these risks is made. An operational risk database is used to record the risk and control assessments and track related issues and mitigation action plans. The risk assessments are reviewed at least annually, or as business conditions change;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>key risk indicators are established and monitored where appropriate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>the database is also used to track operational losses for analysis of root causes, comparison with risk assessments, lessons learned and capital modeling.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement practices include standard reporting to senior management and the Operational Risk Committee of material risks, significant control deficiencies, risk mitigation action plans, losses and key risk indicators. We also monitor external operational risk events to ensure that we remain in line with best practice and take into account lessons learned from publicized operational failures within the financial services industry. Operational risk management is an integral part of the new product development and approval process and the employee performance management process, as applicable.\nInternal Audit, which is the Third LoD, provides an important independent check on controls and test institutional compliance with the ORMF. Internal Audit utilizes a risk-based approach to determine its audit coverage in order to provide an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of key controls over our operations, regulatory compliance and reporting. This includes reviews of the ORMF, the effectiveness and accuracy of the risk assessment process, and the loss data collection and reporting activities.\nCompliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, rules, codes, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation. It is a composite risk that can result in regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, litigation exposure and loss of reputation. Compliance risk is inherent throughout our organization. Compliance risk is managed through a compliance risk management program made up of Regulatory Compliance (designed to comply with the spirit and letter of the laws, regulations, rules codes and standards) and Financial Crime Compliance (designed to prevent, detect and deter compliance issues, including money laundering and terrorist financing activities). Under the oversight of the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management, the Head of Regulatory Compliance and the Head of Financial Crimes Compliance oversee the design, execution and administration of our compliance risk program.\nAll HSBC employees are required to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice. In 2013, regulators and other agencies pursued investigations into historical activities and we continue to work with them in relation to already identified issues. Following the deferred prosecution agreements reached in December 2012 between U.S. authorities and HSBC and HSBC Bank USA in relation to investigations regarding inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions laws, along with a related undertaking with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, management has responded to extensive interviews and data requests and continues to enhance our controls.\nHSBC has already taken specific steps to address these issues including making significant changes to strengthen compliance, risk management and culture. These steps, which should also serve over time to enhance our compliance risk management capabilities, include the following:\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the creation of a new global structure, which will make HSBC easier to manage and control;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>simplifying HSBC's businesses through the ongoing implementation of an organizational effectiveness program and a five economic filters strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>implementing a sixth global risk filter which will standardize the way HSBC does business in high risk countries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>substantially increasing resources and significantly strengthening Compliance as a control (and not only as an advisory) function;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continuing to roll out cultural and values programs that define the way everyone in the HSBC Group should act; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adopting and enforcing the most effective standards globally, including a globally consistent approach to knowing and retaining our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our governance framework for Compliance Risk includes two leadership roles, the U.S. Head of FCC and the U.S. Head of Regulatory Compliance, both with particular expertise and experience in U.S. laws and regulations.\nIt is clear from both our own and wider industry experience that there is a significantly increased level of activity from regulators and law enforcement agencies in pursuing investigations in relation to possible breaches of regulation and that the direct and indirect costs of such breaches can be significant. Coupled with a substantial increase in the volume of new regulation, much of which has some level of extra-territorial effect, and the geographical spread of our businesses, we believe that the level of inherent compliance risk that we face will continue to remain high for the foreseeable future.\nWithin the U.S., the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the remediation of the compliance risk management program. The Regulatory Compliance function is led by the Chief Risk Officer who reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, and the HSBC Head of Group Risk. The U.S. Head of FCC reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer and HSBC Head of Group FCC. This reporting relationship enables the Chief Risk Officer to have direct access to HSBC Group Compliance, HSBC Group Risk and the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer as well as allowing for line of business personnel to be independent. The Chief Risk Officer has broad authority from the Board of Directors and senior\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmanagement to develop the enterprise-wide compliance program and oversee the compliance activities across all business units, jurisdictions and legal entities. This broad authority enables the Chief Risk Officer to identify and resolve compliance issues in a timely and effective manner, and to escalate issues promptly to senior management, the Board of Directors, and HSBC as appropriate.\nWe are committed to delivering the highest quality financial products and services to our customers. Critical to our relationship with our customers is their trust in us, as fiduciary, advisor and service provider. That trust is earned not only through superior service, but also through the maintenance of the highest standards of integrity and conduct. We must, at all times, comply with high ethical standards, treat customers fairly, and comply with both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, and HSBC policies and standards. It is also our responsibility to foster good relations with regulators, recognizing and respecting their role in ensuring adherence with laws and regulations. An important element of this commitment to our customers and shareholder is our compliance risk management program, which is applied enterprise-wide.\nOur enterprise-wide program in HSBC North America is designed in accordance with HSBC policy and the principles established by the FRB in Supervision and Regulation Letter 08-8 (SR 08-8) dated October 16, 2008. By leveraging industry-leading practices and taking an enterprise-wide, integrated approach to managing our compliance risks, we can better identify and understand our compliance requirements, monitor our compliance risk profile, and assess and report our compliance performance across the organization. Consistent with the expectations of HSBC North America's regulators, our enterprise-wide compliance risk management program is designed to promote a consistent understanding of roles and responsibilities as well as consistency in compliance program activities. The program is structured to pro-actively identify as well as quickly react to emerging issues and to assess, control, measure, monitor and report compliance risks across the company, both within and across business lines, support units, jurisdictions and legal entities.\nReputational Risk Management Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves.\nReputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will vary between geographies, groups and individuals.\nHSBC tolerates a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by HSBC Group's Risk Appetite Statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, we are required to articulate and track reputational risk.\nReputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Management Board, the HSBC Group and local Board of Directors and senior management during the establishment of standards for all major aspects of business and the formulation of policy and products. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies set out operational procedures in all areas of reputational risk, including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements.\nWe have taken steps over the past several years to de-risk our remaining business to reduce reputational risk. In addition, we continue to strengthen our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken.\nThe HSBC North America RMM provides governance and oversight of reputational risk. Prior to January 2017, a monthly Risk Map process assessed the level and direction of reputational risk and helped ensure appropriate management action was taken when necessary. Beginning in January 2017, we now rely on the Risk Map assessment produced for the overall operations of HSBC North America and the stand-alone Risk Map was demised.\nStrategic Risk Management Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action. Risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and/or challenges through the strategic planning process.\nThis risk is also a function of the compatibility of an organization's strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation.\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and the HSBC Group levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk Management Security and Fraud risk is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests. The role of Security and Fraud Risk Management (\"SFR\") is the protection of people, property, assets and information by reducing the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, incidents/disasters and groups hostile to our interests. To achieve this, SFR is organizationally part of the business it supports and they advise and assist senior executive management who have overall responsibility for security and fraud issues.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk issues are managed at the HSBC Group level by HSBC Global Security and Fraud Risk. This unit, which has responsibility for information, fraud, contingency, physical and geopolitical risks, is fully integrated within the HSBC Group Risk function. This enables management to identify and mitigate the permutations of these and other non-financial risks across the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe Information Security Risk function is responsible for ensuring that we have a progressive information protection program that is responsive to current and future threats and that we understand and manage our information risks.\nThe Fraud Risk function is responsible for ensuring that effective prevention, detection and investigation measures are in place against all forms of fraudulent activity, whether initiated internally or externally, and is available to support our business. To achieve that and to attain the level of integration needed to face the threat, the management of all types of fraud (e.g. real estate secured receivable fraud and internal fraud, including investigations), is established within one management structure and is part of the HSBC Global Risk function. We use technology extensively to prevent and detect fraud. We have developed a holistic and effective anti-fraud strategy which, in addition to the use of advanced technology, includes fraud prevention policies and practices, the implementation of strong internal controls, an investigations response team and liaison with law enforcement where appropriate.\nThe Contingency Risk function is responsible for ensuring that our critical systems, processes and functions have the resilience to maintain continuity in the face of major disruptive events. Within this wider risk, Business Continuity Management covers the pre-planning for recovery, seeking to minimize the adverse effects of major business disruption against a range of actual or emerging risks. The pre-planning concentrates on the protection of customer services, our staff, revenue generation, the integrity of data and documents and meeting regulatory requirements. Our recovery plans are developed following the completion of a Business Impact Analysis. This determines how much time we could sustain an outage before the level of losses becomes unacceptable (i.e. its criticality). These plans are reviewed and tested every year. The planning is undertaken in accordance with HSBC Group policy and standards and we confirm in an annual compliance certificate that all have been met. Should there be exceptions, these are raised and their short-term resolution is overseen by HSBC Group and HSBC North America business continuity teams. It is important that plans are dynamic and meet all risks, particularly those of an emerging nature such as possible pandemics and cyber-attacks. The ORMF is used to measure our resilience to these risks and is confirmed to HSBC Group and HSBC North America risk committees. Resilience is managed through various risk mitigation measures. These include agreeing with our information technology department about acceptable recovery times of systems, ensuring our critical buildings have the correct infrastructure to enable ongoing operations, requiring critical vendors to have their own recovery plans and arranging with HSBC Group insurance appropriate cover for business interruption costs.\nThe Physical Security Risk function develops practical physical, electronic, and operational countermeasures to ensure that the people, property and assets we manage are protected from crime, theft, attack and groups hostile to our interests.\nGeopolitical Risk provides both regular and ad hoc reporting to business executives and senior SFR management on geopolitical risk profiles and evolving threats. This both enhances strategic business planning and provides an early view into developing security risks. Security travel controls and guidance are also maintained.\nModel Risk Management Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly. In order to manage the risks arising out of the use of incorrect or misused model output or reports, a comprehensive model risk governance framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a HSBC North America Model Standards Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. Each area that uses models maintains model management procedures in accordance with the Model Standards Policy. A HSBC North America model and non-model inventory is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, a model risk measurement framework is used to measure, mitigate and monitor model risk across HSBC North America. During 2016, model risk was managed on an ongoing basis by the HSBC North America Model Oversight Committee (\"MOC\"), which was chaired by the Chief Risk Officer with broad representation from across our businesses and support functions. Based on recent regulatory guidance, in December 2016, the\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMOC was replaced by a new Model Risk Forum, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and has a similar objective as the MOC although with a clearer focus on individual accountability in the management of model risk.\nThe Independent Model Review (\"IMR\") function, which reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for providing effective challenge of models and critical processes implemented for use within HSBC North America. Reviews are conducted in-line with supervisory guidance on model risk management issued by the OCC and FRB as well as other applicable internal and regulatory guidelines. Effective challenge is defined as a critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and produce appropriate changes. IMR's activities are separate from the model development process to ensure that incentives are aligned with the function's role to challenge models and identify model limitations, and the authority and access provided by the HSBC North America Board provides the function with the necessary influence to ensure that its recommendations are acted upon. The independent model review process assesses model development, implementation, use, validation, and governance. IMR scope covers models reported on our model inventory and critical non-model processes. Examples of models and processes that IMR reviews include: Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, Economic Capital, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, Loss Forecasting, Anti Money Laundering, Counterparty Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Risk Sensitivity and Hedging, Valuation and Fair Value Adjustment.\nPension Risk Management Pension risk is the risk of increased costs from the post-employment benefit plans that we have established for our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan. As of January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2016, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $480 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 15, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HSBC Finance Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GLOSSARY OF TERMS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasis point - A unit that is commonly used to describe changes in interest rates.

HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") as \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\".\nHistorically we have offered a variety of lending products including real estate secured, personal non-credit card, and auto finance receivables as well as credit cards, private label credit cards and tax refund anticipation loans, all of which we no longer originate. We have also historically offered various types of insurance products.\nOur primary sources of funding in 2016 were proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and real estate owned (\"REO\") sales proceeds. Prior to 2016, we have also borrowed funds from HSBC affiliates as well as received capital contributions as necessary from HSBC which serve as an additional source of funding. We use the cash generated by these funding sources to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our preferred stockholder.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these operations.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nEconomic Environment The U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during 2016. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") grew at an estimated annual rate of 1.6 percent in 2016, slower than 2015's GDP growth rate of 2.6 percent. Inflation in 2016 continued to run below the Federal Reserve Board's (\"FRB\") 2.0 percent target inflation rate and the FRB has indicated that it currently expects to increase short-term interest rates during 2017. Consumer sentiment in December 2016 improved significantly from the December 2015 levels reflecting an improvement in assessments of current conditions and an increasingly more positive view by consumers of their personal finances. The U.S. economy added approximately 2.2 million jobs during 2016 and the total unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent as of December 2016 as compared with 5.0 percent at December 2015. However, an elevated number of part-time workers continue to seek full-time work and the number of discouraged people who have stopped looking for work remains elevated, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-6 unemployment rate of 9.2 percent at December 2016, as compared with a rate of 9.9 percent at December 2015.\nDespite the continued improvement of the U.S. economy, economic uncertainty remains and the new Administration in the U.S. further adds to this uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical concerns and the regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2017 and beyond.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\n2016 Events\n \u009f As discussed in prior filings, we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost structure as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, in September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. As a result of this decision, we transferred receivables to held for sale with a carrying value of $7,814 million, including accrued interest, at the time of transfer and recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of approximately $541 million. All of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. This decision further accelerated our run-off strategy and, as a result, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded pre-tax expense of $31 million for severance and loan review costs. We will continue to incur loan review costs in future periods as we prepare these receivables for sale.  During 2016, we sold real estate secured receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $10,130 million (aggregate carrying value of $8,973 million) at the time of sale to third-party investors which included $4,478 million (aggregate carrying value of $4,040 million) that were sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled $9,663 million during 2016. We realized a gain of $633 million, including transaction costs, during 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016 real estate secured receivables held for sale totaled $5.7 billion. While we expect that substantially all of these receivables will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depends on many factors, including future market conditions. We also continue to evaluate various options corresponding to the remaining other assets and liabilities. The ultimate resolution and timing is dependent on several factors.\n \u009f Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, we managed our business in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies (\"Group Reporting Basis\") which applied International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU and we reported segment results under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of classifying all remaining receivables as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016, our primary focus has shifted to the successful completion of our receivable sales program. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised the scope and content of our internal management reporting to focus on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") based financial results which more closely reflects the financial performance management is most focused on as receivable sales progress. This U.S. GAAP financial information is used to monitor and review operating results, evaluate trends and make decisions about allocating resources such as employees. As a result of the shift in focus to U.S. GAAP based management reporting, there are no longer any reporting differences between our consolidated results and our segment results. As we only have one segment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in future periods, we no longer report segment results separately for any periods presented. \n \u009f As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. As a result, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million during the second quarter of 2016. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f We previously entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. During the second quarter of 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges. \n \u009f On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the Series B preferred shares are no longer outstanding. \n \u009f In December 2016, our discontinued Card and Retail Services business sold the Class B shares it received in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering (\"Class B Shares\"). Simultaneously, our affiliate, HSBC USA Inc. (\"HSBC USA\"), also sold Class B Shares to the same purchaser. Under the terms of the sale agreement, HSBC USA entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser to retain the litigation risk associated with all of the Class B Shares sold by both us and HSBC USA until the credit card litigation is settled and the Class B Shares can be converted into publicly traded Class A Shares. Immediately following the execution of the sale agreement, we entered into a derivative instrument with HSBC USA to retain the litigation risk associated with our portion of the Class B Shares sold to the purchaser. We recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $44 million as a component of income (loss) from discontinued operations before income tax as a result of these related transactions. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" and Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about these transactions.  Performance, Developments and Trends We reported a net loss of $529 million during 2016 compared with a net loss of $431 million during 2015 and net income of $523 million during 2014. The net loss during 2016 benefited from the sale of the Class B Shares of our discontinued Card and Retail Services business as discussed above. The net loss during 2015 benefited from the reversal of valuation allowances against certain State and local deferred tax assets of $73 million as a result of solely relying on projected future taxable income of HSBC North America in evaluating realizability. Additionally, net loss during 2015 also benefited from the impact of New York City tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $49 million. Net income during 2014 benefited from the impact of New York State tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $55 million.\nLoss from continuing operations was $556 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $394 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations of $547 million during 2014. We reported a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $814 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $865 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations before income tax of $771 million during 2014. The lower loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2016 was driven by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower net interest income. The loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2015 reflects a higher provision for credit losses, higher operating expenses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income.\nOur reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which distort comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(865\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value movement on own fair value option debt attributable to credit spread\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of non-qualifying hedge portfolio\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for securities litigation liability\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to achieve(1)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted performance from continuing operations before income tax(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Costs to achieve reflects transformation costs to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes outlined in the HSBC Investor Update in June 2015. The amounts for 2016 and 2015 include severance costs and file review costs associated with the receivable sales program. \n (2) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nExcluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations before income tax during 2016 improved by $6 million compared with 2015. The improvement was driven by higher other revenues and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and to a lesser extent lower net interest income. Higher other revenues during 2016 reflects an increase of $621 million between years for gains recognized on sales of real estate secured receivables, partially offset by a lower gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives excluding the impact of changes in credit spread and additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2016 on receivables held for sale. Operating expenses declined primarily as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. The higher provision for credit losses during 2016 was driven by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment. The lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for receivables transferred to held for sale in 2016 totaled $576 million which was attributable to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses compared with $234 million during 2015.\nExcluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations during 2015 declined $1,086 million compared with 2014. The decline reflects a significantly higher provision for credit losses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income, partially offset by lower operating expenses. The provision for credit losses in both years was positively impacted by lower loss estimates and improved credit quality, although the impact was more pronounced during 2014. The higher provision for credit losses during 2015 also reflects the transfer of real estate secured receivables to held for sale, which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million that was attributable to credit factors. Lower other revenues largely reflects additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2015 on receivables held for sale compared with reversals of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments during 2014. Operating expenses declined as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs as well as lower fees for consulting services and lower third-party collection fees.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see \"Receivables Review\" for further discussion on our receivable trends, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion on funding and capital and \"Credit Quality\" for additional discussion on our credit trends.\nWe continue to evaluate our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, outstanding debt levels or cost structure in support of HSBC's strategic priorities. Over the past several years, we have taken various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending, outsourcing and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Our focus on cost optimization is continuing and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented.\nFunding and Capital During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not receive any capital contributions. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we retired or called $5,107 million, $6,546 million and $3,524 million, respectively, of term debt and during 2016 we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Our cash requirements in 2016 were met from proceeds of sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs, and REO sales proceeds. For 2017, we expect proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition will generate the liquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations. However, as we continue to execute our receivable sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully repay maturing debt in future periods. As we continue to liquidate our receivable portfolio, HSBC's continued support may be required to properly manage our business operations and maintain appropriate levels of capital. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that it is fully committed and has the capacity and willingness to continue that support.\n Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HSBC Finance Corporation.\nThe significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain critical accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our\n HSBC Finance Corporation \naccounting estimates on our experience, observable market data and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair values of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on the financial condition or operating performance may be material.\nOf the significant accounting policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies as well as the associated estimates, assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nCredit Loss Reserves Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. Consequently, we historically maintained credit loss reserves that reflected our estimate of probable incurred losses of principal, interest and fees in the portion of our receivable portfolio not classified as held for sale. Loss reserve estimates for these receivables were reviewed periodically and adjustments were reflected through the provision for credit losses in the period they became known.\nIn September 2016, we transferred all of our remaining receivables to held for sale, which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result, we no longer record credit loss reserves on our remaining receivable portfolio. Prior to September 2016, we deemed the accounting estimate relating to the reserve for credit losses to be a \"critical accounting estimate\" for the following reasons:\n \u009f Changes in the provision could materially affect our financial results; \n \u009f Estimates related to this reserve required us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, charge-offs, and, when applicable, collateral which are highly uncertain; and \n \u009f The reserve for credit losses was influenced by factors outside of our control including customer payment patterns, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment, bankruptcy trends and the effects of laws and regulations.  Because estimates of the allowance for credit losses involved judgment and were influenced by factors outside of our control, there was uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible such estimates could change. Our estimate of probable incurred credit losses was inherently uncertain because it was highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions which influenced portfolio seasoning, bankruptcy trends, trends in housing markets, delinquency rates and the flow of receivables through various stages of delinquency, the realizability of any collateral and actual loss experience. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses.\nWe previously estimated probable losses for certain receivables which did not qualify as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR Loans\") using a roll rate migration analysis that estimated the likelihood that a receivable would progress through the various stages of delinquency, or buckets, and ultimately charge-off based upon recent performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporated estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis also considered delinquency status, loss experience and severity and took into account whether borrowers had filed for bankruptcy, receivables had been re-aged or were subject to modification. We also considered the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the receivable in the event of default based on historical and recent trends, which was updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months data using the most recently available information. Delinquency status could be affected by customer account management policies and practices, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. When customer account management policies and practices, or changes thereto, shifted receivables that did not qualify as TDR Loans from a \"higher\" delinquency bucket to a \"lower\" delinquency bucket, this shift was reflected in our roll rate statistics. To the extent that re-aged or modified accounts that did not qualify as TDR Loans had a greater propensity to roll to higher delinquency buckets, this was captured in the roll rates. Since the credit loss reserve was computed based on the composite of all of these calculations, this increase in roll rate was applied to receivables in all respective delinquency buckets, which increased the overall reserve level.\nIn addition, loss reserves on receivables held for investment were previously maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors that may not be fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation or when historical trends were not reflective of current inherent losses in the portfolio. Portfolio risk factors previously considered in establishing loss reserves on receivables included product mix, unemployment rates, the credit performance of modified receivables, loan product features such as adjustable rate loans, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets and interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations and other factors that could affect consumer payment patterns on outstanding receivables, such as natural disasters. Another portfolio risk factor we considered was the credit performance of\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ncertain second lien receivables following more delinquent first lien receivables which we own or service. Once we determined that such a second lien receivable was likely to progress to charge off, the loss severity assumed in establishing our credit loss reserves was close to 100 percent. At December 31, 2015, approximately 3 percent of our second lien mortgages held for investment, for which the first lien mortgage was held or serviced by us and had a delinquency status of 90 days or more delinquent were less than 90 days delinquent, and not considered to be a troubled debt restructuring or already recorded at fair value less cost to sell.\nWe also considered key ratios such as reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables and reserves as a percentage of receivables in developing our loss reserve estimate. The results from our reserving process were reviewed each quarter by the Credit Reserve Committee. This committee also considered other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided adequately included all known information at each reporting period. Our Risk and Finance departments previously shared responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of credit loss reserves inherent in our receivable portfolio and they assessed and independently approved our credit loss reserves.\nReserves against receivables modified in troubled debt restructurings were previously determined primarily by analysis of discounted expected cash flows and in certain cases was based on independent valuations of the underlying receivable collateral.\nFor more information about our charge-off and customer account management policies and practices, see \"Credit Quality - Delinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices,\" and \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices,\" in this MD&A.\nValuation of Financial Instruments We have established a control framework which is designed to ensure that fair values are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the determination of fair values rests with Finance. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee, a management committee comprised of senior executives in the Finance, Risk and other functions within HSBC North America, meets monthly to review, monitor and discuss significant valuation matters arising from credit and market risks. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWhere available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is measured using internally developed valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from and corroborated by market data or obtained from reputable third-party vendors. All of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value on a recurring basis are measured based on quoted market prices or observable independently-sourced market-based inputs. Where neither quoted market prices nor observable market parameters are available, fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management's expectation of the inputs that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. However, these unobservable inputs must incorporate market participants' assumptions about risks in the asset or liability and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear the risks. The determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment.\nWe review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs into a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a more detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, see \"Fair Value,\" in this MD&A.\nSignificant assets and liabilities recorded at fair value include the following:\nReceivables held for sale - Receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The estimated fair value of our receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources appropriate for the respective pools of assets aggregated by similar risk characteristics. These sources include recently observed over-the-counter transactions where available and fair value estimates obtained from an HSBC affiliate and a third party valuation specialist for distinct pools of receivables. These fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flow models using assumptions we believe are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such receivables and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades. Our valuation of receivables held for sale is based on aggregated pools of receivables to be sold by similar risk characteristics. The valuation of the receivables held for sale could be impacted in future periods if there are changes in how we expect to execute the receivable sales.\nValuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by investors in the current market given the specific characteristics and inherent credit risk of the receivables held for sale. Some of these inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. We perform analytical reviews of fair value changes on a quarterly basis and periodically validate our valuation methodologies and assumptions based on the results of actual sales of such receivables. We also may hold discussions on\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nvalue directly with potential investors. Since some receivables pools may have unique features, the fair value measurement process uses significant unobservable inputs specific to the performance characteristics of the various receivable portfolios.\nChanges in inputs, in particular in the rate of return that investors would require to purchase assets with the same characteristics and of the same credit quality, could significantly change the carrying amount of the receivables held for sale and related fair value adjustment recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a one percent decline in collateral values, based either on a current broker price opinion or the current estimated property value derived from the property's appraised value at the time of origination updated by a pricing index based on appropriate geographical data (such as the Case-Shiller Home Price Index), coupled with a one percent increase in the rate of return for real estate secured receivables held for sale would have resulted in an estimated decrease of the fair value of real estate secured receivables held for sale of approximately $250 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion including the valuation inputs used in valuing receivables held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities - We regularly use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy to protect future cash flows. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Related collateral that has been received or paid is netted against fair value for financial reporting purposes in those circumstances in which a master netting arrangement with the counterparty exists that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default or termination of any one contract. We believe that the valuation of derivative instruments is a critical accounting estimate because these instruments are valued using discounted cash flow modeling techniques or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity in lieu of observable market value quotes for identical or similar assets or liabilities in active and inactive markets. These modeling techniques require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows and use independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, when available. The valuation models and inputs are developed, reviewed, validated and approved by the Markets Independent Model Review Team of an HSBC affiliate. The models used apply appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure that the derived inputs are used to value only those instruments that share similar risk to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors.\nWe may adjust certain fair value estimates determined using valuation models to ensure that those estimates appropriately represent fair value. These adjustments, which are applied consistently over time, reflect factors such as the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Because of the interrelated nature, we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, model and data uncertainty risks. We also adjust fair value estimates determined using valuation models for counterparty credit risk and our own non-performance risk.\nWe utilize HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, \"HSBC Bank USA\") to determine the fair value of all of our derivatives using these modeling techniques. Significant changes in the fair value can result in equity and earnings volatility as follows:\n \u009f Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge are first recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, then recorded in earnings along with the cash flow effects of the hedged item. Ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. \n \u009f Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has not been designated or ceases to qualify as an effective hedge are reported in earnings.  A control framework has been established which is designed to ensure that fair values are validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the measurement of fair values rests with the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWe test effectiveness for all derivatives designated as hedges under the \"long haul\" method both at inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis, to ascertain whether the derivative used in a hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment is conducted using statistical regression analysis. If we determine that a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting as of the beginning of the quarter in which such determination was made. We also believe the assessment of the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions is a critical accounting estimate due to the use of statistical regression analysis in making this determination. Inputs to statistical regression analysis require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are susceptible to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates as well as the selection of a convention for the treatment of credit spreads in the analysis. Statistical regression analysis also involves the use of additional assumptions including the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ndetermination of the period over which the analysis should occur. The statistical regression analysis for our derivative instruments is performed by HSBC Bank USA.\nThe outcome of the statistical regression analysis can result in earnings volatility as the mark-to-market on derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges and the ineffectiveness associated with qualifying hedges are recorded in earnings. For example, a 10 percent adverse change in the value of our derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges would have reduced gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives by approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor more information about our policies regarding the use of derivative instruments, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" and Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term debt carried at fair value - We have elected the fair value option for certain issuances of our fixed rate debt in order to align our accounting treatment with that of HSBC. Valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value both the interest rate component and the credit component of the debt. In many cases, management can obtain quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities but the markets may not be active, the prices may not be current, or such price quotations may differ substantially either over time or among market makers. Changes in such estimates, and in particular the credit component of the valuation, can be volatile from period to period and may impact the total mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value recorded in our consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in interest rates across all terms would have increased our reported mark-to-market by approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credits and net operating and other losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, totaled $2,897 million and $2,923 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback available. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate.\nWe are included in HSBC North America's consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and in various combined State tax returns. We have entered into a tax allocation agreement with HSBC North America and its subsidiary entities which governs the current amount of taxes to be paid or received by the various entities and, therefore, we look at HSBC North America and its affiliates in reaching conclusions on recoverability. Based on our forecasts of future taxable income, we currently anticipate that HSBC North America's operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets.\nThe use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will affect taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance.\nOur interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate.\nThe carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is also determined by the enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate. Consequently, any changes in the U.S. corporate income tax rate will impact the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset. The new Administration in the U.S. has indicated an interest in significantly reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. Because we do not yet know the details of the new Administration's corporate tax plan, it is not possible to quantify the one-time impact from a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might ultimately result upon tax reform enactment. However, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could result in a decrease in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and a reduction to our net income and\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ntotal equity during the period in which any tax rate change is enacted. For example, a hypothetical 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 34 percent at December 31, 2016 would result in a write-down of our net deferred tax asset of approximately $80 million.\nAdditional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 can be found in Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nContingent Liabilities Both we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. Certain of these activities are or purport to be class actions seeking damages in significant amounts. These actions include assertions concerning violations of laws and/or unfair treatment of consumers. We have also been subject to various governmental and regulatory proceedings.\nWe estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from those estimates. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nLitigation and regulatory exposure is a critical accounting estimate because it represents key areas of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control. Due to the inherent uncertainties and other factors involved in such matters, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately prevail in each instance. Such uncertainties impact our ability to determine whether it is probable that a liability exists and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Also, as the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is influenced by factors that are outside of our control, it is reasonably possible our estimated liability under these proceedings may change. We will continue to update our accruals for these legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings as facts and circumstances change. See Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n Receivables Review \nThe following table summarizes receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increases (Decreases) From\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,854\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables held for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,411\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien real estate secured receivable\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables held for sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,591\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n * Not meaningful \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nReal estate secured receivables held for investment The decrease since December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily reflects the decision to expand our receivable sales program in June 2015 and the decision in September 2016 to transfer all receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. To a lesser extent the decrease as compared with both periods also reflects continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. Liquidation rates in our real estate secured receivable portfolio continued to be impacted by low receivable prepayments as few refinancing opportunities exist for our customers.\nReceivables held for sale The decrease since December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of receivable sales during 2016 with a carrying value of $8,973 million, partially offset by the transfer of all receivables to held for sale during September 2016 as discussed above. The increase in receivables held for sale since December 31, 2014 reflects the changes to our receivable sales program in June 2015 and September 2016 as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of receivable sales during 2016 and 2015 with a carrying value of $8,973 million and $1,995 million, respectively. To a lesser extent, the increase was also partially offset by continued liquidation in the portfolio as well as the impact of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments.\nIn response to the financial crisis, lenders have significantly tightened underwriting standards, substantially limiting the availability of alternative and subprime mortgages. As fewer financing options currently exist in the marketplace for home buyers, properties in certain markets are remaining on the market for longer periods of time which contributes to home price depreciation. For many of our customers, the ability to refinance and access equity in their homes is no longer an option. These industry trends continue to impact our portfolio and are reflected in additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of receivables held for sale, including a rollforward of the receivable held for sale balance for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n Results of Operations \nAs we continue to make progress in our strategy to sell our real estate secured receivable portfolio, we will see declines in net interest income. Decreases in operating expenses may not necessarily decline in line with the run-off and sale of our receivable portfolio as a result of certain fixed costs. Accordingly, net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2016 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nUnless noted otherwise, the following discusses amounts from continuing operations as reported in our consolidated statement of income.\nNet Interest Income The following table summarizes net interest income and net interest margin for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) % Columns: comparison to average interest-earning assets.  Net interest income decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower interest expense and higher overall yields on total interest earning assets as discussed in more detail below:\n \u009f Average receivable levels decreased in 2016 and 2015 as a result of receivable sales and continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. \n \u009f Interest expense decreased during 2016 and 2015 as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by the impact of higher average rates due to the maturing of certain lower rate long-term borrowings in 2016 and 2015. Higher average rates in 2016 also reflect the impact of increases in rates on certain variable rate debt during the first quarter of 2016. \n \u009f Overall yields on total average interest earning assets increased during 2016 and 2015 driven by a shift in mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments which have significantly lower yields than our receivable portfolio as well as higher receivable yields. Receivable yields increased during 2016 and 2015 due to the impact of lower levels of nonaccrual real estate secured receivables, partially offset in 2016 by a lower impact from changes in yield assumptions on receivables participating in payment incentive programs. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nNet interest margin was 3.41 percent in 2016 compared with 2.75 percent in 2015 and 2.68 percent in 2014. The increase in net interest margin during 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of higher overall yields on total average interest earning assets due to a shift in the mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments and higher receivable yields as discussed above. Net interest margin in 2016 also reflects an improved cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets as interest expense decreased at a faster pace than average interest earning assets in spite of higher average rates in 2016 as discussed above. In 2015, the improvement in net interest margin was partially offset by a higher cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets as a result of higher average rates as discussed above.\nThe following table summarizes the significant trends affecting the comparability of net interest income and net interest margin:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income/net interest margin from prior year period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact to net interest income resulting from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower asset levels\n</td> <td>(664\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivable yields\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset mix\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of funds (rate and volume)\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income/net interest margin for current year period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe varying maturities and repricing frequencies of both our assets and liabilities expose us to interest rate risk. When the various risks inherent in both the asset and the debt do not meet our desired risk profile, we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks to acceptable interest rate risk levels.

The provision for credit losses in both 2016 and 2015 was impacted by the recording of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments related to credit factors on receivables transferred to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in 2016 as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio. These adjustments reflect the differences between amortized cost and the amount we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivables, which takes into consideration factors that are not relevant under the incurred loss model in establishing credit loss reserves for receivables held for investment, such as life time losses and the discounting of cash flows. When there is no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors are present, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of provision for credit losses.\nThe remainder of the provision for credit losses was also higher during 2016 as compared with 2015. While both periods were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels and the impact of lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days delinquent, as well as lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, the impact was more pronounced during 2015. Additionally, the provision for credit losses during 2015 was also impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio.\nNet charge-off dollars totaled $932 million during 2016 compared with $2,156 million during 2015. Dollars of net charge-offs during both periods were impacted by lower receivable levels subsequent to the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of the transfer of receivables to held for sale are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled $268 million during 2016 compared with $1,622 million during 2015. Additionally, the credit portion of the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nlower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $576 million during 2016 compared with $234 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of charge-off dollars associated with receivables transferred to held for sale during both periods, dollars of net charge-offs decreased during 2016 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices during 2016. See \"Credit Quality\" for further discussion of our net charge-offs.\nSubsequent to the transfer of receivables to held for sale, no further provision for credit losses or charge-offs are recorded as receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result of transferring all the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no provision for credit losses or charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe following discusses our provision for credit losses by product for 2015 as compared with 2014:\n \u009f The provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables increased during 2015 largely due to the impact of our expanded receivable sales program which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million related to credit factors as discussed above. Excluding the impact of this item, the provision for credit losses remained higher during 2015. Both 2015 and 2014 were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels, lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, and improved credit quality, including lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent, although the impact to the provision for credit losses was more pronounced during 2014. Additionally, 2015 was impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio. \n \u009f The provision for credit losses for personal non-credit card receivables for 2014 reflects recoveries received from borrowers on fully charged-off personal non-credit card receivables that were not previously sold as well as cash proceeds in 2014 received from the bulk sale of recovery rights of certain previously charged-off personal non-credit card receivables.  The provision for credit losses for 2014 also reflects the sale of recovery rights in May 2014 for receivables with outstanding balances of $3.3 billion which had previously been fully-charged off. The cash proceeds from this transaction of $57 million were recorded as a recovery of charged-off receivables during 2014.\nNet charge-offs totaled $2,156 million during 2015 compared with $693 million during 2014. Net charge-offs during 2015 were significantly impacted by the expansion of our receivable sales program during 2015 as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer associated with receivables transferred to held for sale are recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $1,622 million during 2015 compared with $58 million during 2014. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $234 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of dollars of charge-offs related to receivables transferred to held for sale in both periods, net charge-offs decreased during 2015 reflecting lower receivable levels and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency as a result of improvements home prices since December 31, 2014 and improvements in economic conditions. See \"Credit Quality\" for further discussion of our net charge-offs.\nOther Revenues The following table summarizes the components of other revenues:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative related expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate secured receivables\n</td> <td>633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative related expense includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives which did not qualify as effective hedges under hedge accounting principles and ineffectiveness on derivatives which are qualifying hedges. Designation of swaps as effective hedges reduces the volatility that would otherwise result from mark-to-market accounting. All derivatives are economic hedges of the underlying debt instruments regardless of the accounting treatment. The following table summarizes derivative related expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedge accounting ineffectiveness\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative related expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe previously entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles. These financial instruments were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. In May 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges.\nDerivative related expense deteriorated during 2016 compared with 2015. The components of derivative related expense are discussed below:\n \u009f Net realized losses improved during 2016 as a result of fewer non-qualifying hedges outstanding during the year. \n \u009f Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio deteriorated during 2016 compared with 2015 reflecting the impact of falling rates which had occurred prior to the termination of the swaps and was more pronounced than the impact of falling rates in 2015. \n \u009f Hedge accounting ineffectiveness was primarily related to our cross currency cash flow hedges that are approaching maturity.  Derivative related expense improved during 2015 compared with 2014. The components of derivative related expense are discussed below:\n \u009f Net realized losses improved modestly during 2015 as a result of fewer non-qualifying hedges outstanding during the year. \n \u009f Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio reflects the impact of falling long-term interest rates during both 2015 and 2014, although the impact was more pronounced in 2014. \n \u009f Hedge accounting ineffectiveness was primarily related to our cross currency cash flow hedges.  Net income volatility in future periods has been reduced as a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio. Derivative related expense for 2016 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nGain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives reflects fair value changes on our fixed rate debt accounted for under fair value option as well as the fair value changes and realized gains (losses) on the related derivatives associated with debt designated at fair value. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased during 2016 primarily due to lower net realized gains as a result of fewer derivative positions during the year as our fair value option debt and related derivatives mature as well as a tightening of our credit spreads. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives improved modestly during 2015 as a result of the impact of a widening of our credit spreads during 2015 and the impact of changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term, partially offset by lower realized gains on the related derivatives as a result of fewer derivative positions as discussed above. See Note 9, \"Fair Value Option,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information, including a break out of the components of the gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives.\nNet income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. The gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nServicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates represents revenue received under service level agreements under which we service real estate secured receivables as well as rental revenue from HSBC Technology & Services (USA) Inc. (\"HTSU\") for certain office and administrative costs. Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower rental income as a result of the sale of a data center located in Vernon Hills, Illinois to HTSU during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nin 2016, servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6 million as a result of prepaying a $512 million draw on a credit agreement with an affiliate in December 2016.\nLower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale during 2016, 2015 and 2014 is summarized in the following table:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded on receivables transferred to held for sale during the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment subsequent to the initial transfer to held for sale\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables transferred to held for sale totaling $587 million of which $11 million was attributable to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The remainder of the total initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for 2016 of $576 million was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. During 2015, we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses.\nDuring 2016, we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment subsequent to the initial transfer to held for sale totaling $201 million of which $263 million was attributable to fair value adjustments primarily as a result of establishing separate pools for receivables being marketed. Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. This was partially offset by the impact of settlements resulting from receivable payoffs or the transfer of receivables to REO totaling $62 million. During 2015, we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale totaling $130 million of which $155 million related to changes in fair value and $25 million related to settlements.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.\nGain on sale of real estate secured receivables increased during 2016 and decreased during 2015. The following table summarizes receivables sold by period.\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid principal balance at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate carrying value at the time of sale\n</td> <td>8,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate secured receivables\n</td> <td>633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDifferences in the gain on sale of real estate secured receivables realized between years reflects both differences in the relative size of the receivable pools sold as well as differences in the composition of the receivable pools sold. The increase in 2016 also reflects improved pricing during the year, particularly during the fourth quarter.\nOther income decreased during 2016 and increased during 2015. All periods were impacted by changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities. Excluding the impact of changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities from all periods, other income was essentially flat during 2016 and 2015.\nOur reserve for potential repurchase liability represents our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred resulting from various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our receivable sales. Because the level of receivable repurchase losses are dependent upon strategies for bringing claims or pursuing legal action for losses incurred, the level of the liability for receivables repurchase losses requires significant judgment. As such, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates making it reasonably possible that they could change. During the third quarter of 2015, management concluded that, due to new developments in case law and other factors, it was appropriate to release the repurchase reserve liability related to receivables sold by Decision One Mortgage Company LLC prior to the third quarter of 2007. The following table summarizes the changes in our reserve for potential repurchase liability related to our receivable sales:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in liability recorded through earnings\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses.

Salary and employee benefits in both 2016 and 2015 were impacted by severance costs resulting from changes in our receivable sales program in September 2016 and June 2015, respectively. Severance costs during 2016 totaled $21 million compared with $34 million in 2015.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, net decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as a result of the sale of a data center during the third quarter of 2015 as discussed above as well as lower rent, repair and utility costs reflecting the impact of the continuing reduced scope of our business operations.\nReal estate owned expenses decreased during 2016 driven by fewer average numbers of REO properties held during the year. Additionally, REO expenses in 2015 benefited from an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million as discussed below. During 2016, we brought the servicing of our entire REO portfolio in-house.\nReal estate owned expenses were impacted during 2015 by an adjustment to the final charge-off calculation at the time of foreclosure for certain receivables in prior periods. This resulted in an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million when the REO properties associated with these receivables were sold. Excluding the impact of this item, REO expenses increased during 2015 driven by lower gains on sales of REO properties during 2015 as a result of a significant decrease in the number of REO properties sold during 2015. The increase in 2015 was partially offset by the impact of lower estimated losses due to continuing improvements in the housing market in 2015 and lower holding costs due to fewer average numbers of REO properties held during 2015 and lower costs per property.\nSupport services from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower technology costs from an HSBC affiliate and lower fees for receivable servicing by HSBC affiliates as a result of the sale of receivables during 2016 and 2015. The decrease during 2016 also reflects the impact of terminating a guarantee during the third quarter of 2015 related to a surety bond.\nProvision for securities litigation liability As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million and $700 million, respectively.\nOther expenses decreased during 2016 reflecting lower litigation costs as well as the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in file review costs related to our receivable sales program.\nOther expenses increased during 2015 reflecting the impact of higher litigation costs, partially offset by lower fees for consulting services as well as lower third-party collection fees resulting from lower foreclosure activities as we have fewer receivables in the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nprocess of foreclosure as a result of the receivable sales program. Other expenses in 2015 was also positively impacted by the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs.\nIncome taxes Our effective tax rate was (31.7) percent in 2016 compared with (54.5) percent in 2015 and 29.1 percent in 2014. For a complete analysis of the differences between effective tax rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pre-tax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate, see Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations intended to discourage corporate inversions by re-characterizing certain inter-company debt as equity, effectively eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid to related parties under certain circumstances. Final and temporary regulations were released in October 2016 that exempt regulated financial groups such as HSBC and its affiliates from those re-characterization rules. Certain documentation rules included in the regulations will apply to HSBC and its affiliates, and we will analyze the requirements in order to implement the regulations on a timely basis in accordance with the rules. We do not anticipate a significant financial accounting impact upon implementation of the regulations.\n Credit Quality \nCredit Loss Reserves As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. As a result, our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale which is carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer has any associated credit loss reserves as any adjustments to the carrying value are reflected in other income. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in this MD&A and Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on our policies for establishing credit loss reserves prior to September 2016.\nThe table below sets forth credit loss reserves and credit loss reserve ratios for the historical periods indicated. The transfer to held for sale of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment in September 2016 has resulted in our entire receivable portfolio being carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer have any associated credit loss reserves. Transfers of receivables to held for sale impacts comparability between credit loss reserves and the related reserve ratios between periods.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserves(1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit loss reserve ratios:(2)(3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves as a percentage of receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) At December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, credit loss reserves includes $12 million, $33 million, $52 million and $132 million, respectively, related to receivables held for investment which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell primarily reflecting an estimate of additional loss following an interior appraisal of the property. \n (2) Reserves associated with accrued finance charges, which totaled $51 million, $323 million, $326 million and $360 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are reported within our total credit loss reserve balances noted above, although receivables and nonaccrual receivables as reported generally exclude accrued finance charges. The credit loss reserve ratios presented in the tables above exclude any reserves associated with accrued finance charges. \n (3) Credit loss reserve ratios exclude receivables and nonaccrual receivables associated with receivable portfolios which are considered held for sale as these receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value with no corresponding credit loss reserves. \n (4) These ratios are impacted by changes in the level of real estate secured receivables held for investment which have been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies and are not classified as held for sale.

Credit loss reserves associated with all receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale during 2015 totaled $1,622 million and were recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale. Credit loss reserves at December 31, 2015 were also positively impacted by lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2014 decreased as compared with December 31, 2013 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2014 due to lower levels of TDR Loans as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional real estate secured receivables during 2014 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $58 million during 2014 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2013 decreased as compared with December 31, 2012 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2013 due to lower levels of new TDR Loan volumes as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional pools of real estate secured receivables during 2013 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $164 million during 2013 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserve ratios Following is a discussion of changes in the reserve ratios we previously considered in establishing reserve levels. As discussed above, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale and we no longer have any credit loss reserves. Accordingly, there are no credit loss reserve ratios at December 31, 2016.\nReserves as a percentage of receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015 decreased significantly as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables as the majority of the receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as part of the expansion of the receivable sales program were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2014 as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, largely due to the lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans and improved credit quality as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in receivables. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2013 as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables.\nReserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables held for investment were impacted by nonaccrual real estate secured receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2015 decreased as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables as the majority of the nonaccrual receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as discussed above were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2014 were higher as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in nonaccrual receivables, as discussed more fully below, outpaced the decrease in credit loss reserves. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2013 were lower as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, driven by the lower reserve requirement for TDR Loans as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables.\nSee Note 6, \"Credit Loss Reserves,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit loss reserves by product for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nDelinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices Our delinquency and net charge-off ratios reflect, among other factors, changes in the quality of our receivables, transfers of receivables to held for sale, the average age of our receivables, the success of our collection and customer account management efforts, general economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment rates, any changes to our charge-off policies and significant catastrophic events such as natural disasters and global pandemics. See Note 2,\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our charge-off and nonaccrual policies.\nDelinquency Our policies and practices for the collection of receivables, including our customer account management policies and practices, permit us to modify the terms of receivables, either temporarily or permanently (a \"modification\"), and/or to reset the contractual delinquency status of an account that is contractually delinquent to current (a \"re-age\"), based on indicators or criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability. Such policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure or repossession as determined to be appropriate. If a re-aged account subsequently experiences payment defaults, it will again become contractually delinquent and be included in our delinquency ratios.\nThe table below summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency for receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percent of receivables and receivables held for sale (\"delinquency ratio\"). As previously discussed, in June 2015 we expanded our receivable sales program and in September 2016 we transferred all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale which must be considered in comparing dollars of contractual delinquency and the delinquency ratio between the periods presented.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars of contractual delinquency(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late stage delinquency(2)(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Individually evaluated for impairment(4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collectively evaluated for impairment(5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate secured receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for sale(6)\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquency ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for investment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late stage delinquency\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Individually evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collectively evaluated for impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate secured receivables held for investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables held for sale\n</td> <td>8.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>8.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) The receivables held for investment balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. \n (2) Two-months-and-over contractually delinquent receivables are classified as \"late stage delinquency\" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the amounts above include $23 million and $60 million, respectively, of receivables that at some point in their life cycle were written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 60 and 180 days past due. \n (3) Amount includes TDR Loans which totaled $131 million and $297 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. \n (4) This amount represents delinquent receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. For TDR Loans we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nimpairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals.\n (5) This amount represents delinquent receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. \n (6) At December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, dollars of contractual delinquency for receivable held for sale includes $333 million, $443 million and $381 million, respectively, of real estate secured receivables which are also classified as TDR Loans.  Dollars of delinquency and the delinquency ratio for real estate secured receivables held for investment At December 31, 2016, there were no dollars of delinquency or delinquency ratio for receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.\nDollars of delinquency for receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 decreased as compared with December 31, 2015 as a result of receivables sold during 2016 and improvements in credit quality, partially offset by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio.\nDelinquency ratio for real estate secured receivables held for sale The delinquency ratio for receivables held for sale was 8.05 percent at December 31, 2016 compared with 6.88 percent December 31, 2015. The increase as compared to December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of real estate secured receivable sales during 2016 as a significant portion of the receivables sold were less than 30 days contractually delinquent which results in receivables held for sale decreasing at a faster pace than dollars of delinquency. Additionally, the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio in September 2016 also impacts the comparability of the delinquency ratio between periods.\nSee \"Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" regarding the delinquency treatment of re-aged and modified accounts.\nNet Charge-offs The following table summarizes net charge-off of receivables both in dollars and as a percent of average receivables (\"net charge-off ratio\"). During a quarter in which receivables are transferred to receivables held for sale, those receivables continue to be included in the average receivable balances prior to such transfer and any charge-off related to those receivables prior to such transfer, including the recognition of existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer and the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment, if any, remain in our net charge-off totals. However, in the quarter following the transfer to held for sale classification, the receivables are no longer included in average receivables as such receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and, accordingly, there are no further charge-offs associated with these receivables. As a result, the amounts and ratios presented below are not comparable between periods.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-off dollars:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal non-credit card receivables(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-off ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate secured receivables\n</td> <td>15.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal non-credit card receivables(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>15.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate charge-offs and REO expense as a percent of average real estate secured receivables\n</td> <td>15.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Although we sold our personal non-credit card receivable portfolio on April 1, 2013, subsequent to April 1, 2013 we continued to receive recoveries on personal non-credit card receivables that were fully charged-off prior to the sale of the portfolio. These recoveries are reflected in the table above. As these personal non-credit card receivables were fully charged-off with no carrying value remaining on our consolidated balance sheet, a net charge-off ratio for our personal non-credit card receivable portfolio cannot be calculated for 2014. However, the recoveries for personal non-credit card receivables are reflected in the total net charge-off ratio for 2014.  Net real estate secured receivable charge-offs dollars for all periods were impacted by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled $268 million, $1,622 million and $58 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $576 million and $234 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was not a credit related lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded during 2014. Net charge-off dollars for 2016 also includes an out of period\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nadjustment which decreased net charge-offs by $12 million in order to properly reflect charge-offs for receivables which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification.\nExcluding the impact to net charge-off dollars related of the items discussed above, net charge-offs dollars remained lower in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices. As a result of transferring all of the remaining receivables held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no additional charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe net real estate secured receivable charge-off ratio for 2016 increased as compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above.\nReal estate charge-offs and REO expenses as a percentage of average real estate secured receivables for 2016 increased compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by the impact of lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above and lower REO expenses. See \"Results of Operations\" for further discussion of REO expense.\nNonperforming Assets As previously discussed, during the third quarter of 2016 we transferred to held for sale all remaining receivables classified as held for investment which must be considered in comparing nonperforming assets between periods. Nonperforming assets consisted of the following for the periods presented:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late stage delinquency(2)(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Individually evaluated for impairment(4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collectively evaluated for impairment(5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment(6)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate owned\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual receivables held for sale(1)(7)\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) The receivable balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. Nonaccrual receivables reflect all receivables which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as second lien receivables (regardless of delinquency status) where the first lien receivable that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. Nonaccrual receivables held for investment and held for sale do not include receivables totaling $252 million, $501 million and $627 million at December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, which are less than 90 days contractually delinquent and not accruing interest. In addition, nonaccrual receivables do not include receivables which have made qualifying payments and have been re-aged and the contractual delinquency status reset to current as such activity, in our judgment, evidences continued payment probability. If a re-aged receivable subsequently experiences payment default and becomes 90 or more days contractually delinquent, it will be reported as nonaccrual. \n (2) Nonaccrual receivables are classified as \"late stage delinquency\" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the amounts above include $15 million and $35 million, respectively, of receivables held for investment that at some point in their life cycle were evaluated for write-down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 90 and 180 days past due. \n (3) This amount includes TDR Loans which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell which totaled $124 million at December 31, 2015 and $274 million at December 31, 2014. \n (4) This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. This amount represents TDR Loans for which we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow impairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals. \n (5) This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. \n (6) At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual second lien real estate secured receivables held for investment totaled $63 million and $122 million, respectively. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n (7) At December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual receivables held for sale include $272 million, $285 million and $362 million, respectively, of real estate secured receivables held for sale which are also classified as TDR Loans.  Nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment At December 31, 2016, there were no nonaccrual receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.\nNonaccrual receivables held for sale decreased modestly at December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 as the impact of receivables sold during 2016 and improvements in credit quality were largely offset by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual receivables and receivables held for sale in the table above include TDR Loans totaling $272 million, $463 million and $1,101 million, respectively, some of which at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are carried at the lower of amortized cost of the fair value of the collateral less cost sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. See Note 5, \"Receivables Held for Investment, net,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding TDR Loan balances.\nCustomer Account Management Policies and Practices Our policies and practices focus on ethical and effective collection and customer account management efforts for each receivable. Our customer account management policies and practices permit us to take action with respect to delinquent or troubled accounts based on criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability, as well as a continuing desire for borrowers to stay in their homes. The policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate. From time to time we re-evaluate these policies and procedures and make changes as deemed appropriate.\nCurrently, we utilize the following account management actions:\n \u2022 Modification - Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable either temporarily or permanently without changing the delinquency status of the receivable. Modifications may include changes to one or more terms of the receivable including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, extension of the amortization period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal. \n \u2022 Collection Re-age - Management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an account to current but does not involve any changes to the original terms and conditions of the receivable. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent. We use collection re-aging as an account and customer management tool in an effort to increase the cash flow from our account relationships, and accordingly, the application of this tool is subject to complexities, variations and changes from time to time. \n \u2022 Modification Re-age - Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable, either temporarily or permanently, and also resets the contractual delinquency status of an account to current as discussed above. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent.  Our account management programs include certain eligibility criteria, including time since last account management action, minimum qualifying payment required and a maximum number of account management actions during a five year period.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nThe following table shows the number of real estate secured accounts remaining in our portfolio (including receivables held for sale) as well as the outstanding receivable balance of these accounts as of the period indicated for receivables for which we have taken an account management action by the type of action taken, some of which may have received multiple account management actions.\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Number of Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Receivable Balance(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(accounts are in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collection re-age only\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification only\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification re-age\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables modified and/or re-aged(1)\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collection re-age only\n</td> <td>63.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification only\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification re-age\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables modified and/or re-aged(1)\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collection re-age only\n</td> <td>84.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification only\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modification re-age\n</td> <td>64.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total receivables modified and/or re-aged(1)\n</td> <td>155.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) The outstanding receivable balance included in this table reflects the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but excludes any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables.

Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or having similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\nOur receivable portfolio is comprised of loans to non-prime consumers. Such customers are individuals who have limited credit histories, modest incomes, high debt-to-income ratios or have experienced credit problems evidenced by occasional delinquencies, prior charge-offs, bankruptcy or other credit related actions. The majority of our secured receivables have high loan-to-value ratios.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nBecause our lending activities were primarily to individual consumers, we do not have receivables from any industry group that equal or exceed 10 percent of total receivables at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

It must be able to fund its operations, service its debt obligations and pay dividends to its preferred stockholder. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock in 2016 or 2015. We maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process.\nHSBC Finance Corporation manages all of its operations directly and in 2016, funded these businesses primarily through proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and REO sales proceeds.\nAt various times, we make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support operations or provide funding for long-term facilities and technological improvements. During 2016 and 2015, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries were more than offset by dividends paid to HSBC Finance Corporation.\nHSBC Related Funding We work with our affiliates under the oversight of HSBC North America to maximize funding opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC's operations in the United States. All of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and our funding requirements are sourced primarily through HSBC USA or HSBC North America.\nDue to affiliates totaled $3,300 million and $5,925 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The interest rates on funding from HSBC subsidiaries are market-based and comparable to those available from unaffiliated parties.\nIn July 2016, we prepaid a $600 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In October 2016, we prepaid a $1,000 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In December 2016, we prepaid $512 million that was outstanding under a credit agreement with HSBC USA.\nSee Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our funding arrangements with HSBC affiliates, including derivatives.\nShort-Term Investments Securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled $2,392 million and $2,724 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Interest bearing deposits at banks totaled $1,500 million at December 31, 2016 and were with HSBC Bank USA. We did not have any interest bearing deposits at banks at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments increased as compared with December 31, 2015 reflecting cash received from receivable sales, partially offset by the retirement of debt, payment of the securities litigation settlement and the redemption of the Series B preferred stock.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nLong-Term Debt (excluding amounts due to affiliates) decreased to $4,340 million at December 31, 2016 from $9,510 million at December 31, 2015. There were no issuances of long-term debt during 2016 or 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $5,107 million and $6,546 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSecured financings previously issued under public trusts of $404 million at December 31, 2016 are secured by $750 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016. Secured financings previously issued under public trusts of $879 million at December 31, 2015 were secured by $1,654 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015.\nIn order to eliminate future foreign exchange risk, currency swaps were used at the time of issuance of all foreign-denominated notes to fix the notes in U.S. dollars.\nWe have used derivatives for managing interest rate and currency risk and have received loan commitments from affiliates, but we do not otherwise enter into off-balance sheet transactions.\nPreferred Stock In November 2010, we issued 1,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to an affiliate for $1.0 billion. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and payable quarterly at a rate of 8.625 percent. During years in which there is an accumulated deficit, dividends on the Series C preferred stock are paid from additional paid-in-capital. The Series C preferred stock may be redeemed at our option after November 30, 2025.\nIn June 2005, we issued 575,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $575 million. On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million.\nSee Note 12, \"Redeemable Preferred Stock,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommon Equity During 2016 and 2015, we did not receive any capital contributions.\nEquity ratio Common and preferred equity to total assets totaled 39.14 percent at December 31, 2016 compared with 27.48 percent at December 31, 2015.\nHSBC North America continues to review the composition of its capital structure following the adoption by the U.S. banking regulators of the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which were effective as of January 1, 2014. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, we have replaced instruments whose treatment was less favorable under the new rules with Basel III compliant instruments. Any required funding has been, or will be, integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates.\nHSBC North America participates in the FRB's CCAR program and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run stress test results in April 2016. In June 2016, the FRB informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2016 CCAR submission. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity.\n2017 Funding Strategy The following table summarizes our current range of estimates for funding needs and sources for 2017:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding Needs and Sources for 2017\n</td> <td>Minimum\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Maximum\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in billions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding needs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured debt maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short term investments\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total funding needs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding sources:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivable sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total funding sources\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Primarily reflects miscellaneous cash provided by operating activities.

These cash obligations could be funded through proceeds of sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and REO sales, funding from affiliates or capital contributions from HSBC.\nThe pension obligation for our employees are the contractual obligation of HSBC North America and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.\nOur purchase obligations for goods and services at December 31, 2016 were not significant.\n Fair Value \nNet income volatility arising from changes in either interest rate or credit components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives or changes in the fair value of receivables held for sale, REO or receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell affects the comparability of reported results between periods. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.\nFair Value Hierarchy Accounting principles related to fair value measurements establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the \"Fair Value Framework\"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; \n \u009f whether the instrument is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price that is readily available; \n \u009f the size of transactions occurring in an active market; \n \u009f the level of bid-ask spreads; \n \u009f a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, market liquidity; \n \u009f whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; \n \u009f whether the inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and \n \u009f whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value.  Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for the identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume.\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We generally classify derivative contracts as well as our own debt issuance for which we have elected fair value option as Level 2 measurements. These valuations are typically obtained from a third party valuation source which, in the case of derivatives, includes valuations provided by HSBC Bank USA.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis totaling $5,674 million (41 percent of total assets) and $8,265 million (34 percent of total assets), respectively. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nClassification within the fair value hierarchy is based on whether the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. As such, the classification within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic and can be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period. Transfers between leveling categories are assessed, determined and recognized at the end of each reporting period.\nSee Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details including our valuation techniques as well as the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Additionally, see Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 measurements during 2016 and 2015.\n Risk Management \nOverview Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. To do so, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. This framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also ensures that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. We strive to continuously improve our risk management processes through ongoing employee training and development.\nOur risk management framework is underpinned by a strong risk culture and reinforced by our values and standards. These are instrumental in aligning the behaviors of individuals with our attitude to assuming and managing risk and ensuring that our risk profile remains in line with our risk appetite. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that ensures appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk.\nOur Board of Directors and its committees, principally the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committees, have oversight responsibility for the effective management of risk. The Risk Committee advises the Board of Directors on our business run-off strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nManagement is accountable for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of our risk management policies. Day-to-day risk management activities are the responsibility of senior managers of individual businesses, supported by HSBC global functions. We use the Three Lines of Defense (\"LoD\") model to underpin our approach to strong risk management. It defines who is responsible to do what to identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor, and mitigate risks, encouraging collaboration and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to risk ownership and risk management. Decisions are not taken by committees, but by specific individuals, in accordance with the Three LoD model, to promote clear accountability. The Board and its sub-committees remain collective decision-making bodies. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model.\nOur Risk Management function is headed by our Chief Risk Officer, who is responsible for the risk management framework. This includes establishing policies, monitoring of risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management policies resides with the Chief Risk Officer supported by the Risk Management Meeting (\"RMM\") of the HSBC Finance Corporation Executive Committee (\"EXCO\"). EXCO is the senior most management committee at HSBC Finance Corporation and the RMM is its meeting to discuss risk matters.\nSpecific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following HSBC North America or Risk Committees:\n \u009f the HSBC North America Asset Liability Committee (\"HSBC North America ALCO\"); \n \u009f the Operational Risk Committee; \n \u009f the HSBC North America Third Party Risk Oversight Committee; \n \u009f the HSBC North America Capital Management Committee; \n \u009f the Regulatory Compliance Governance Committee; and \n \u009f the Financial Crime Compliance (\"FCC\") Governance Committee.  Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities as it relates to risk oversight.\nHSBC North America ALCO provides oversight of all liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the HSBC North America Chief Financial Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are members of the HSBC North America ALCO. Subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and HSBC Group, the HSBC North America ALCO advises the Chief Financial Officer of HSBC North America in setting the limits of acceptable risk, monitoring the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assessing the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. The HSBC North America ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity.\nMaintaining a conservative risk profile is a core part of our philosophy. This encompasses maintaining a strong capital position and having effective liquidity and funding management. Additionally, we have zero tolerance for the following:\n \u009f knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated; \n \u009f operating without the appropriate systems and controls in place to prevent and detect financial crime; \n \u009f deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers arising from our operations or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements; and \n \u009f inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by our operations.  The principal risks associated with our operations include the following:\n \u009f Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract; \n \u009f Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself; \n \u009f Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; \n \u009f Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to rate movements; \n \u009f Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events (including legal risk); \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation; \n \u009f Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences; \n \u009f Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; \n \u009f Security and Fraud risk is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests; \n \u009f Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly; and \n \u009f Pension risk is the risk of increased costs from the post-employment benefit plans that we have established for our employees.  The following risk tools and processes are used to identify, manage and mitigate risks and are integral to risk management.\n \u009f We regularly monitor our risk profile across a range of risk categories. We assess the potential of these risks to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or sustainability of our business on a current and projected basis. The risks are regularly assessed through our risk appetite profile where thematic issues arise and are considered for escalation and appropriate action. This process enables us to identify current and forward-looking risks and to take action which either stops these risks materializing or limits their impact. \n \u009f In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use simulation models to help quantify the risk we are taking. The output from some of these models is included in this section of our filing. By their nature, models are based on various assumptions and relationships. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections.  Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract. Day-to-day management of credit risk is administered by our Retail Chief Credit Officer with ultimate reporting responsibility to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, to the Risk Committee of the HSBC North America Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group Chief Risk Officer. Our credit and portfolio management procedures currently focus on effective collections and customer account management efforts, in addition to supporting disciplined execution of the receivable sales program. Our customer account management policies and practices are described under the caption \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" in this MD&A. Also see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our policies surrounding credit loss reserves. Our policies and procedures are consistent with HSBC Group standards and are regularly reviewed and updated both on an HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC level. The credit risk function continues to refine \"early warning\" indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of current experience. These risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process.\nCredit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business and risk management functions to ensure that our receivable portfolio is managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Charter is endorsed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee, and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Board of Directors will have oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews.\nCounterparty credit risk is our primary exposure on our currency swap portfolio. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of our existing currency swap derivative contracts are with HSBC Bank USA. The fair value of our agreements with\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nHSBC Bank USA required us to provide collateral to the affiliate of $317 million at December 31, 2016 and $491 million at December 31, 2015, all of which was provided in cash.\nSee Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to interest rate risk management and Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nLiquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself. Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to fund our assets and meet commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. The primary driver of our liquidity going forward will be sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition. However, as we continue to execute our receivables sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. We currently do not expect third-party debt to be a source of funding for us in the future given the run-off nature of our business. Any required incremental funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plan and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or will be obtained through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has indicated it remains fully committed and has the capacity to continue to provide such support.\nHSBC North America maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan, which identifies certain potential early indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on its businesses. The liquidity contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators is monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, widening of our credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. In the event of a cash flow crisis, our objective is to fund cash requirements without HSBC affiliate access to the wholesale unsecured funding market for at least 90 days. Contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through liquidation of short term investments, sale of receivables or secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. We maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash and short-term liquid assets.\nWe project cash flow requirements and determine the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated balance sheet run-off, including liquidation of receivables held for sale, contingent liabilities and the ability of HSBC USA to access wholesale funding markets.\nPrior to 2016, we employed stressed coverage ratios to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. Stressed coverage ratios, incorporating HSBC-specific stress scenarios, were used to monitor the resilience to severe liquidity stresses. Beginning in 2016, HSBC replaced these stressed coverage ratios with the Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\"LCR\") as discussed below. As a result, we now employ this ratio as part of our approach to liquidity risk management.\nThe Basel Committee based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard beginning in 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our LCR ratio under the EU LCR rule was significantly in excess of 100 percent. A LCR ratio of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets.\nIn September 2014, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the U.S., applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR final rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that will qualify as high-quality liquid assets and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the final rule, U.S. institutions began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. The LCR final rule does not address the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nHSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America may need to make further changes to its liquidity profile to support compliance with any future final rules. HSBC Finance Corporation may need to adjust its liquidity profile to support HSBC North America's compliance with these rules, but it is not anticipated to significantly impact our operations.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") issued final standards for total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") requirements for global systemically important banks (\"G-SIBs\"), which will apply to our ultimate parent HSBC once implemented in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \"internal\" TLAC to be prepositioned (issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, to be fully phased in January 1, 2022. In the United States, the FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the U.S. in December 2016. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. intermediate holding companies of non-US G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework that may require HSBC North America to issue additional long-term debt.\nAs indicated by the major rating agencies, our credit ratings are directly dependent upon the continued support of HSBC. A credit rating downgrade would increase future borrowing costs only for new debt obligations, if any. As discussed above, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that they remain fully committed and have the capacity to continue that support.\nThe following table summarizes our credit ratings at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Standard &\nPoor's\nCorporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\nInvestors\nService\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior debt\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior subordinated debt\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.\nIn March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nIn July 2016, Standard & Poor's Corporation (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the EU. As a result, S&P changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S&P affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nAlthough we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be changed in the future. As of December 31, 2016, there were no pending actions from these rating agencies in terms of changes to the ratings presented in the table above for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nOther conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include unforeseen capital requirements, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would require us to post additional collateral for our cross currency swaps, a slowdown in the rate of attrition of our balance sheet and an inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC and its subsidiaries.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion of our liquidity position.\nMarket Risk Management The objective of our market risk management process is to manage and control market risk exposures in order to optimize return on risk. Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios. Market risk is managed by the HSBC North America Head of Market Risk.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nWe maintain an overall risk management strategy that primarily uses standard, over-the-counter cross currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps.\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps. Our financial statements are affected by movements in exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated debt.\nInterest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses due to rate movements. We use simulation models to measure the impact of anticipated changes in interest rates on net interest income and execute appropriate risk management actions. The key assumptions used in these models include projected balance sheet attrition, cash flows from a certain derivative financial instrument and changes in market conditions. While these assumptions are based on our best estimates of future conditions, we cannot precisely predict our earnings due to the uncertainty inherent in the economic environment. Historically we have used derivative financial instruments, principally standard, over-the-counter interest rate swaps, to manage these exposures.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is also changing as the balance sheet declines and a growing percentage of our remaining real estate receivables are modified and/or re-aged. Prior to the credit crisis, real estate receivables had original contractual maturities of 30 years but active customer refinancing resulted in a much shorter duration of three years. Debt was typically issued in intermediate and longer term maturities (5 to 10 years) to maximize the liquidity benefit. The interest rate risk created by combining short duration assets with long duration liabilities was reduced historically by entering into hedge positions that reduced the duration of the liabilities portfolio.\nThe duration assumption for our fixed rate real estate secured receivable portfolio is estimated to be 3.8 years at December 31, 2016 reflecting the impact of a higher percentage of receivables staying on our balance sheet longer than prior to the credit crisis due to the impact of modification programs and/or lack of refinancing alternatives. At the same time, the duration of our liability portfolio continues to decline due to the passage of time and the absence of new long-term debt issuance.\nA principal part of our management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modeling). We aim, through our management of interest rate risk, to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while weighing the cost of hedging activities on the current net revenue stream.\nNet interest income simulation modeling techniques are utilized to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various rate shock scenarios, such as scenarios in which rates rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period as well as the impact of an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve. The following table reflects the impact on projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars are in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated increase (decrease) in projected net interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point increase in the yield curve (reflects projected quarterly rate movements of 25 basis points at the beginning of each quarter)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from a gradual 100 basis point decrease in the yield curve (reflects projected quarterly rate movements of 25 basis points at the beginning of each quarter)\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resulting from an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs compared with December 31, 2015, the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate rise and the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate reduction reflect updates of economic stress scenarios including housing price index assumptions, regular adjustments of asset and liability behavior assumptions, run-off of the balance sheet and model enhancements.\nA principal consideration underlying the projected net interest income at risk analysis is the projected prepayment of receivable balances for a given economic scenario. Individual loan underwriting standards in combination with housing valuations, receivable modification programs, changes to our foreclosure processes and macroeconomic factors related to available mortgage credit are the key assumptions driving these prepayment projections. While we have utilized a number of sources to refine these projections,\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nwe cannot currently project precise prepayment rates with a high degree of certainty in all economic environments given post crisis, significant changes in both subprime mortgage underwriting standards and property valuations across the country.\nThe projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.\nOperational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (including legal risk). Operational risk is relevant to every aspect of our business and covers a wide spectrum of risks. Our strategy is to manage operational risks in a cost effective manner, within targeted levels consistent with the risk appetite. Our Operational Risk Management Framework (\"ORMF\") ensures minimum standards of governance and organization over operational risk and internal control throughout HSBC Finance Corporation and covers all our businesses and operations (including all activities, processes and systems). During 2016, our risk profile was dominated by compliance and legal risks. The incidence of and response to regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial services firms is significant. We have prioritized resources to develop and execute remedial actions to regulatory matters, including enhancing or adding internal controls and we closely monitor the possible impacts of litigation on our operational risk profile.\nWe have established an independent operational risk management discipline in the U.S. which is led by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The mission of the Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, is to provide governance and strategic oversight of the ORMF, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and appetite of operational risk. Selected results and reports from this committee are communicated to the RMM and subsequently to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Management in the First LoD is responsible for managing and controlling operational risk. In addition, the central operational risk function, in conjunction with the other second line subject matter experts, provides functional oversight by coordinating the following activities:\n \u009f developing operational risk management policies and procedures; \n \u009f developing and managing methodologies and tools to support the identification, assessment, and monitoring of operational risks; \n \u009f providing firm-wide operational risk and control reporting; \n \u009f identifying emerging risks; \n \u009f analyzing root-cause of large operational risk losses; \n \u009f providing operational risk training and awareness programs for employees throughout the firm; \n \u009f communicating with the First LoD, including Business Risk and Control Managers, to ensure the ORMF is executed within their respective business or function; \n \u009f independently reviewing the operational risk and control assessments, communicating results to management and monitoring remedial actions that may be necessary to improve the assessments; and \n \u009f modeling operational risk losses and scenarios for capital management purposes.  Management of operational risk includes identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation, rectification, and reporting of the results of risk events, including losses and compliance with local regulatory requirements. These key components of the ORMF have been communicated by issuance of HSBC standards and procedures. Details and local application of the standards have been documented and communicated by issuance of a U.S. Operational Risk Policy. Key elements of the policy and our ORMF include:\n \u009f business and function management is responsible for the assessment, identification, management, and reporting of their operational risks and monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of key controls; \n \u009f material risks are assigned an overall risk prioritization / rating based on the typical and severe assessments and considers the direct financial costs and the indirect impacts to the business. An assessment of the effectiveness of key controls that mitigate these risks is made. An operational risk database is used to record the risk and control assessments and track related issues and mitigation action plans. The risk assessments are reviewed at least annually, or as business conditions change; \n \u009f key risk indicators are established and monitored where appropriate; and \n \u009f the database is also used to track operational losses for analysis of root causes, comparison with risk assessments, lessons learned and capital modeling. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nManagement practices include standard reporting to senior management and the Operational Risk Committee of material risks, significant control deficiencies, risk mitigation action plans, losses and key risk indicators. We also monitor external operational risk events to ensure that we remain in line with best practice and take into account lessons learned from publicized operational failures within the financial services industry. Operational risk management is an integral part of the new product development and approval process and the employee performance management process, as applicable.\nInternal Audit, which is the Third LoD, provides an important independent check on controls and test institutional compliance with the ORMF. Internal Audit utilizes a risk-based approach to determine its audit coverage in order to provide an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of key controls over our operations, regulatory compliance and reporting. This includes reviews of the ORMF, the effectiveness and accuracy of the risk assessment process, and the loss data collection and reporting activities.\nCompliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, rules, codes, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation. It is a composite risk that can result in regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, litigation exposure and loss of reputation. Compliance risk is inherent throughout our organization. Compliance risk is managed through a compliance risk management program made up of Regulatory Compliance (designed to comply with the spirit and letter of the laws, regulations, rules codes and standards) and Financial Crime Compliance (designed to prevent, detect and deter compliance issues, including money laundering and terrorist financing activities). Under the oversight of the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management, the Head of Regulatory Compliance and the Head of Financial Crimes Compliance oversee the design, execution and administration of our compliance risk program.\nAll HSBC employees are required to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice. In 2013, regulators and other agencies pursued investigations into historical activities and we continue to work with them in relation to already identified issues. Following the deferred prosecution agreements reached in December 2012 between U.S. authorities and HSBC and HSBC Bank USA in relation to investigations regarding inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions laws, along with a related undertaking with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, management has responded to extensive interviews and data requests and continues to enhance our controls.\nHSBC has already taken specific steps to address these issues including making significant changes to strengthen compliance, risk management and culture. These steps, which should also serve over time to enhance our compliance risk management capabilities, include the following:\n \u2022 the creation of a new global structure, which will make HSBC easier to manage and control; \n \u2022 simplifying HSBC's businesses through the ongoing implementation of an organizational effectiveness program and a five economic filters strategy; \n \u2022 implementing a sixth global risk filter which will standardize the way HSBC does business in high risk countries; \n \u2022 substantially increasing resources and significantly strengthening Compliance as a control (and not only as an advisory) function; \n \u2022 continuing to roll out cultural and values programs that define the way everyone in the HSBC Group should act; and \n \u2022 adopting and enforcing the most effective standards globally, including a globally consistent approach to knowing and retaining our customers.  Our governance framework for Compliance Risk includes two leadership roles, the U.S. Head of FCC and the U.S. Head of Regulatory Compliance, both with particular expertise and experience in U.S. laws and regulations.\nIt is clear from both our own and wider industry experience that there is a significantly increased level of activity from regulators and law enforcement agencies in pursuing investigations in relation to possible breaches of regulation and that the direct and indirect costs of such breaches can be significant. Coupled with a substantial increase in the volume of new regulation, much of which has some level of extra-territorial effect, and the geographical spread of our businesses, we believe that the level of inherent compliance risk that we face will continue to remain high for the foreseeable future.\nWithin the U.S., the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the remediation of the compliance risk management program. The Regulatory Compliance function is led by the Chief Risk Officer who reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, and the HSBC Head of Group Risk. The U.S. Head of FCC reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer and HSBC Head of Group FCC. This reporting relationship enables the Chief Risk Officer to have direct access to HSBC Group Compliance, HSBC Group Risk and the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer as well as allowing for line of business personnel to be independent. The Chief Risk Officer has broad authority from the Board of Directors and senior\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nmanagement to develop the enterprise-wide compliance program and oversee the compliance activities across all business units, jurisdictions and legal entities. This broad authority enables the Chief Risk Officer to identify and resolve compliance issues in a timely and effective manner, and to escalate issues promptly to senior management, the Board of Directors, and HSBC as appropriate.\nWe are committed to delivering the highest quality financial products and services to our customers. Critical to our relationship with our customers is their trust in us, as fiduciary, advisor and service provider. That trust is earned not only through superior service, but also through the maintenance of the highest standards of integrity and conduct. We must, at all times, comply with high ethical standards, treat customers fairly, and comply with both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, and HSBC policies and standards. It is also our responsibility to foster good relations with regulators, recognizing and respecting their role in ensuring adherence with laws and regulations. An important element of this commitment to our customers and shareholder is our compliance risk management program, which is applied enterprise-wide.\nOur enterprise-wide program in HSBC North America is designed in accordance with HSBC policy and the principles established by the FRB in Supervision and Regulation Letter 08-8 (SR 08-8) dated October 16, 2008. By leveraging industry-leading practices and taking an enterprise-wide, integrated approach to managing our compliance risks, we can better identify and understand our compliance requirements, monitor our compliance risk profile, and assess and report our compliance performance across the organization. Consistent with the expectations of HSBC North America's regulators, our enterprise-wide compliance risk management program is designed to promote a consistent understanding of roles and responsibilities as well as consistency in compliance program activities. The program is structured to pro-actively identify as well as quickly react to emerging issues and to assess, control, measure, monitor and report compliance risks across the company, both within and across business lines, support units, jurisdictions and legal entities.\nReputational Risk Management Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves.\nReputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will vary between geographies, groups and individuals.\nHSBC tolerates a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by HSBC Group's Risk Appetite Statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, we are required to articulate and track reputational risk.\nReputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Management Board, the HSBC Group and local Board of Directors and senior management during the establishment of standards for all major aspects of business and the formulation of policy and products. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies set out operational procedures in all areas of reputational risk, including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements.\nWe have taken steps over the past several years to de-risk our remaining business to reduce reputational risk. In addition, we continue to strengthen our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken.\nThe HSBC North America RMM provides governance and oversight of reputational risk. Prior to January 2017, a monthly Risk Map process assessed the level and direction of reputational risk and helped ensure appropriate management action was taken when necessary. Beginning in January 2017, we now rely on the Risk Map assessment produced for the overall operations of HSBC North America and the stand-alone Risk Map was demised.\nStrategic Risk Management Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action. Risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and/or challenges through the strategic planning process.\nThis risk is also a function of the compatibility of an organization's strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nWe have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and the HSBC Group levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk Management Security and Fraud risk is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests. The role of Security and Fraud Risk Management (\"SFR\") is the protection of people, property, assets and information by reducing the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, incidents/disasters and groups hostile to our interests. To achieve this, SFR is organizationally part of the business it supports and they advise and assist senior executive management who have overall responsibility for security and fraud issues.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk issues are managed at the HSBC Group level by HSBC Global Security and Fraud Risk. This unit, which has responsibility for information, fraud, contingency, physical and geopolitical risks, is fully integrated within the HSBC Group Risk function. This enables management to identify and mitigate the permutations of these and other non-financial risks across the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe Information Security Risk function is responsible for ensuring that we have a progressive information protection program that is responsive to current and future threats and that we understand and manage our information risks.\nThe Fraud Risk function is responsible for ensuring that effective prevention, detection and investigation measures are in place against all forms of fraudulent activity, whether initiated internally or externally, and is available to support our business. To achieve that and to attain the level of integration needed to face the threat, the management of all types of fraud (e.g. real estate secured receivable fraud and internal fraud, including investigations), is established within one management structure and is part of the HSBC Global Risk function. We use technology extensively to prevent and detect fraud. We have developed a holistic and effective anti-fraud strategy which, in addition to the use of advanced technology, includes fraud prevention policies and practices, the implementation of strong internal controls, an investigations response team and liaison with law enforcement where appropriate.\nThe Contingency Risk function is responsible for ensuring that our critical systems, processes and functions have the resilience to maintain continuity in the face of major disruptive events. Within this wider risk, Business Continuity Management covers the pre-planning for recovery, seeking to minimize the adverse effects of major business disruption against a range of actual or emerging risks. The pre-planning concentrates on the protection of customer services, our staff, revenue generation, the integrity of data and documents and meeting regulatory requirements. Our recovery plans are developed following the completion of a Business Impact Analysis. This determines how much time we could sustain an outage before the level of losses becomes unacceptable (i.e. its criticality). These plans are reviewed and tested every year. The planning is undertaken in accordance with HSBC Group policy and standards and we confirm in an annual compliance certificate that all have been met. Should there be exceptions, these are raised and their short-term resolution is overseen by HSBC Group and HSBC North America business continuity teams. It is important that plans are dynamic and meet all risks, particularly those of an emerging nature such as possible pandemics and cyber-attacks. The ORMF is used to measure our resilience to these risks and is confirmed to HSBC Group and HSBC North America risk committees. Resilience is managed through various risk mitigation measures. These include agreeing with our information technology department about acceptable recovery times of systems, ensuring our critical buildings have the correct infrastructure to enable ongoing operations, requiring critical vendors to have their own recovery plans and arranging with HSBC Group insurance appropriate cover for business interruption costs.\nThe Physical Security Risk function develops practical physical, electronic, and operational countermeasures to ensure that the people, property and assets we manage are protected from crime, theft, attack and groups hostile to our interests.\nGeopolitical Risk provides both regular and ad hoc reporting to business executives and senior SFR management on geopolitical risk profiles and evolving threats. This both enhances strategic business planning and provides an early view into developing security risks. Security travel controls and guidance are also maintained.\nModel Risk Management Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly. In order to manage the risks arising out of the use of incorrect or misused model output or reports, a comprehensive model risk governance framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a HSBC North America Model Standards Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. Each area that uses models maintains model management procedures in accordance with the Model Standards Policy. A HSBC North America model and non-model inventory is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, a model risk measurement framework is used to measure, mitigate and monitor model risk across HSBC North America. During 2016, model risk was managed on an ongoing basis by the HSBC North America Model Oversight Committee (\"MOC\"), which was chaired by the Chief Risk Officer with broad representation from across our businesses and support functions. Based on recent regulatory guidance, in December 2016, the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nMOC was replaced by a new Model Risk Forum, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and has a similar objective as the MOC although with a clearer focus on individual accountability in the management of model risk.\nThe Independent Model Review (\"IMR\") function, which reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for providing effective challenge of models and critical processes implemented for use within HSBC North America. Reviews are conducted in-line with supervisory guidance on model risk management issued by the OCC and FRB as well as other applicable internal and regulatory guidelines. Effective challenge is defined as a critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and produce appropriate changes. IMR's activities are separate from the model development process to ensure that incentives are aligned with the function's role to challenge models and identify model limitations, and the authority and access provided by the HSBC North America Board provides the function with the necessary influence to ensure that its recommendations are acted upon. The independent model review process assesses model development, implementation, use, validation, and governance. IMR scope covers models reported on our model inventory and critical non-model processes. Examples of models and processes that IMR reviews include: Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, Economic Capital, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, Loss Forecasting, Anti Money Laundering, Counterparty Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Risk Sensitivity and Hedging, Valuation and Fair Value Adjustment.\nPension Risk Management Pension risk is the risk of increased costs from the post-employment benefit plans that we have established for our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan. As of January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2016, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $480 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 15, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n GLOSSARY OF TERMS \nBasis point - A unit that is commonly used to describe changes in interest rates. The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as a 1 percent change equals a 100 basis point change or .01 percent change equals 1 basis point.\nContractual Delinquency - A method of determining aging of past due accounts based on the status of payments under the receivable. An account is generally considered to be contractually delinquent when payments have not been made in accordance with the loan terms.

These functions must also maintain and monitor controls for which they are directly responsible.\nSecured Financing - A type of collateralized funding transaction in which the interests in a dedicated pool of real estate secured receivables are sold to a special purpose entity which then issues securities that are sold to investors. These transactions do not receive sale treatment for accounting purposes.\nTDR Loans - Troubled debt restructurings, which are substantially all receivables modified as a result of a financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modification was permanent or temporary, including all modifications with trial periods. TDR Loans also include all re-ages, except first time early stage delinquency re-ages where the customer has not been granted a prior re-age or modification. Additionally, TDR Loans include receivables discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed. TDR Loans are considered to be impaired loans.\nThird Line of Defense or Third LoD - Part of the Three LoD model for managing risk. The Third LoD is comprised of Internal Audit, who provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the design, implementation and embedding of the risk management frameworks as well as the management of the risks and controls by the First LoD and control oversight by the Second LoD.\nThree Lines of Defense Model or Three LoD Model - This model is used to manage our risk environment and defines who is responsible to identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and mitigate risk. It encourages collaboration and enables efficient coordination of risk and control activities.\nU.S. GAAP - Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n

Prior to November 15, 2016, HSBC Finance Corporation was owned by HSBC Investments (North America) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which was dissolved. HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") as \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\".\nHistorically we have offered a variety of lending products including real estate secured, personal non-credit card, and auto finance receivables as well as credit cards, private label credit cards and tax refund anticipation loans, all of which we no longer originate. We have also historically offered various types of insurance products.\nOur primary sources of funding in 2016 were proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and real estate owned (\"REO\") sales proceeds. Prior to 2016, we have also borrowed funds from HSBC affiliates as well as received capital contributions as necessary from HSBC which serve as an additional source of funding. We use the cash generated by these funding sources to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our preferred stockholder.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these operations.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nEconomic Environment The U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during 2016. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") grew at an estimated annual rate of 1.6 percent in 2016, slower than 2015's GDP growth rate of 2.6 percent. Inflation in 2016 continued to run below the Federal Reserve Board's (\"FRB\") 2.0 percent target inflation rate and the FRB has indicated that it currently expects to increase short-term interest rates during 2017. Consumer sentiment in December 2016 improved significantly from the December 2015 levels reflecting an improvement in assessments of current conditions and an increasingly more positive view by consumers of their personal finances. The U.S. economy added approximately 2.2 million jobs during 2016 and the total unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent as of December 2016 as compared with 5.0 percent at December 2015. However, an elevated number of part-time workers continue to seek full-time work and the number of discouraged people who have stopped looking for work remains elevated, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-6 unemployment rate of 9.2 percent at December 2016, as compared with a rate of 9.9 percent at December 2015.\nDespite the continued improvement of the U.S. economy, economic uncertainty remains and the new Administration in the U.S. further adds to this uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical concerns and the regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2017 and beyond.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\n2016 Events\n \u009f As discussed in prior filings, we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost structure as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. As part of this on-going evaluation, in September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. As a result of this decision, we transferred receivables to held for sale with a carrying value of $7,814 million, including accrued interest, at the time of transfer and recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of approximately $541 million. All of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. This decision further accelerated our run-off strategy and, as a result, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded pre-tax expense of $31 million for severance and loan review costs. We will continue to incur loan review costs in future periods as we prepare these receivables for sale.  During 2016, we sold real estate secured receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $10,130 million (aggregate carrying value of $8,973 million) at the time of sale to third-party investors which included $4,478 million (aggregate carrying value of $4,040 million) that were sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Aggregate cash consideration received totaled $9,663 million during 2016. We realized a gain of $633 million, including transaction costs, during 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016 real estate secured receivables held for sale totaled $5.7 billion. While we expect that substantially all of these receivables will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depends on many factors, including future market conditions. We also continue to evaluate various options corresponding to the remaining other assets and liabilities. The ultimate resolution and timing is dependent on several factors.\n \u009f Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, we managed our business in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies (\"Group Reporting Basis\") which applied International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU and we reported segment results under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of classifying all remaining receivables as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016, our primary focus has shifted to the successful completion of our receivable sales program. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised the scope and content of our internal management reporting to focus on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") based financial results which more closely reflects the financial performance management is most focused on as receivable sales progress. This U.S. GAAP financial information is used to monitor and review operating results, evaluate trends and make decisions about allocating resources such as employees. As a result of the shift in focus to U.S. GAAP based management reporting, there are no longer any reporting differences between our consolidated results and our segment results. As we only have one segment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in future periods, we no longer report segment results separately for any periods presented. \n \u009f As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. As a result, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million during the second quarter of 2016. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f We previously entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. During the second quarter of 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges. \n \u009f On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the Series B preferred shares are no longer outstanding. \n \u009f In December 2016, our discontinued Card and Retail Services business sold the Class B shares it received in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering (\"Class B Shares\"). Simultaneously, our affiliate, HSBC USA Inc. (\"HSBC USA\"), also sold Class B Shares to the same purchaser. Under the terms of the sale agreement, HSBC USA entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser to retain the litigation risk associated with all of the Class B Shares sold by both us and HSBC USA until the credit card litigation is settled and the Class B Shares can be converted into publicly traded Class A Shares. Immediately following the execution of the sale agreement, we entered into a derivative instrument with HSBC USA to retain the litigation risk associated with our portion of the Class B Shares sold to the purchaser. We recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $44 million as a component of income (loss) from discontinued operations before income tax as a result of these related transactions. See Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" and Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about these transactions.  Performance, Developments and Trends We reported a net loss of $529 million during 2016 compared with a net loss of $431 million during 2015 and net income of $523 million during 2014. The net loss during 2016 benefited from the sale of the Class B Shares of our discontinued Card and Retail Services business as discussed above. The net loss during 2015 benefited from the reversal of valuation allowances against certain State and local deferred tax assets of $73 million as a result of solely relying on projected future taxable income of HSBC North America in evaluating realizability. Additionally, net loss during 2015 also benefited from the impact of New York City tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $49 million. Net income during 2014 benefited from the impact of New York State tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax benefit of $55 million.\nLoss from continuing operations was $556 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $394 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations of $547 million during 2014. We reported a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $814 million during 2016 compared with a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $865 million during 2015 and income from continuing operations before income tax of $771 million during 2014. The lower loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2016 was driven by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower net interest income. The loss from continuing operations before income tax during 2015 reflects a higher provision for credit losses, higher operating expenses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income.\nOur reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which distort comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:\n\n \n (1) Costs to achieve reflects transformation costs to deliver the cost reduction and productivity outcomes outlined in the HSBC Investor Update in June 2015. The amounts for 2016 and 2015 include severance costs and file review costs associated with the receivable sales program. \n (2) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nExcluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations before income tax during 2016 improved by $6 million compared with 2015. The improvement was driven by higher other revenues and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and to a lesser extent lower net interest income. Higher other revenues during 2016 reflects an increase of $621 million between years for gains recognized on sales of real estate secured receivables, partially offset by a lower gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives excluding the impact of changes in credit spread and additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2016 on receivables held for sale. Operating expenses declined primarily as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. The higher provision for credit losses during 2016 was driven by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment. The lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for receivables transferred to held for sale in 2016 totaled $576 million which was attributable to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses compared with $234 million during 2015.\nExcluding the impact of the items presented in the table above, adjusted performance from continuing operations during 2015 declined $1,086 million compared with 2014. The decline reflects a significantly higher provision for credit losses, lower other revenues and lower net interest income, partially offset by lower operating expenses. The provision for credit losses in both years was positively impacted by lower loss estimates and improved credit quality, although the impact was more pronounced during 2014. The higher provision for credit losses during 2015 also reflects the transfer of real estate secured receivables to held for sale, which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million that was attributable to credit factors. Lower other revenues largely reflects additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2015 on receivables held for sale compared with reversals of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments during 2014. Operating expenses declined as a result of the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs as well as lower fees for consulting services and lower third-party collection fees.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see \"Receivables Review\" for further discussion on our receivable trends, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion on funding and capital and \"Credit Quality\" for additional discussion on our credit trends.\nWe continue to evaluate our operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, outstanding debt levels or cost structure in support of HSBC's strategic priorities. Over the past several years, we have taken various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending, outsourcing and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Our focus on cost optimization is continuing and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented.\nFunding and Capital During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not receive any capital contributions. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we retired or called $5,107 million, $6,546 million and $3,524 million, respectively, of term debt and during 2016 we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million. Our cash requirements in 2016 were met from proceeds of sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs, and REO sales proceeds. For 2017, we expect proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition will generate the liquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations. However, as we continue to execute our receivable sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully repay maturing debt in future periods. As we continue to liquidate our receivable portfolio, HSBC's continued support may be required to properly manage our business operations and maintain appropriate levels of capital. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that it is fully committed and has the capacity and willingness to continue that support.\n Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HSBC Finance Corporation.\nThe significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain critical accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our\n HSBC Finance Corporation \naccounting estimates on our experience, observable market data and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair values of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on the financial condition or operating performance may be material.\nOf the significant accounting policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies as well as the associated estimates, assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nCredit Loss Reserves Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. Consequently, we historically maintained credit loss reserves that reflected our estimate of probable incurred losses of principal, interest and fees in the portion of our receivable portfolio not classified as held for sale. Loss reserve estimates for these receivables were reviewed periodically and adjustments were reflected through the provision for credit losses in the period they became known.\nIn September 2016, we transferred all of our remaining receivables to held for sale, which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result, we no longer record credit loss reserves on our remaining receivable portfolio. Prior to September 2016, we deemed the accounting estimate relating to the reserve for credit losses to be a \"critical accounting estimate\" for the following reasons:\n \u009f Changes in the provision could materially affect our financial results; \n \u009f Estimates related to this reserve required us to project future cash flows, delinquencies, charge-offs, and, when applicable, collateral which are highly uncertain; and \n \u009f The reserve for credit losses was influenced by factors outside of our control including customer payment patterns, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment, bankruptcy trends and the effects of laws and regulations.  Because estimates of the allowance for credit losses involved judgment and were influenced by factors outside of our control, there was uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible such estimates could change. Our estimate of probable incurred credit losses was inherently uncertain because it was highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions which influenced portfolio seasoning, bankruptcy trends, trends in housing markets, delinquency rates and the flow of receivables through various stages of delinquency, the realizability of any collateral and actual loss experience. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses.\nWe previously estimated probable losses for certain receivables which did not qualify as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR Loans\") using a roll rate migration analysis that estimated the likelihood that a receivable would progress through the various stages of delinquency, or buckets, and ultimately charge-off based upon recent performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. This migration analysis incorporated estimates of the period of time between a loss occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. This analysis also considered delinquency status, loss experience and severity and took into account whether borrowers had filed for bankruptcy, receivables had been re-aged or were subject to modification. We also considered the loss severity expected based on the underlying collateral, if any, for the receivable in the event of default based on historical and recent trends, which was updated monthly based on a rolling average of several months data using the most recently available information. Delinquency status could be affected by customer account management policies and practices, such as the re-age or modification of accounts. When customer account management policies and practices, or changes thereto, shifted receivables that did not qualify as TDR Loans from a \"higher\" delinquency bucket to a \"lower\" delinquency bucket, this shift was reflected in our roll rate statistics. To the extent that re-aged or modified accounts that did not qualify as TDR Loans had a greater propensity to roll to higher delinquency buckets, this was captured in the roll rates. Since the credit loss reserve was computed based on the composite of all of these calculations, this increase in roll rate was applied to receivables in all respective delinquency buckets, which increased the overall reserve level.\nIn addition, loss reserves on receivables held for investment were previously maintained to reflect our judgment of portfolio risk factors that may not be fully reflected in the statistical roll rate calculation or when historical trends were not reflective of current inherent losses in the portfolio. Portfolio risk factors previously considered in establishing loss reserves on receivables included product mix, unemployment rates, the credit performance of modified receivables, loan product features such as adjustable rate loans, economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets and interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations and other factors that could affect consumer payment patterns on outstanding receivables, such as natural disasters. Another portfolio risk factor we considered was the credit performance of\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ncertain second lien receivables following more delinquent first lien receivables which we own or service. Once we determined that such a second lien receivable was likely to progress to charge off, the loss severity assumed in establishing our credit loss reserves was close to 100 percent. At December 31, 2015, approximately 3 percent of our second lien mortgages held for investment, for which the first lien mortgage was held or serviced by us and had a delinquency status of 90 days or more delinquent were less than 90 days delinquent, and not considered to be a troubled debt restructuring or already recorded at fair value less cost to sell.\nWe also considered key ratios such as reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables and reserves as a percentage of receivables in developing our loss reserve estimate. The results from our reserving process were reviewed each quarter by the Credit Reserve Committee. This committee also considered other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided adequately included all known information at each reporting period. Our Risk and Finance departments previously shared responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of credit loss reserves inherent in our receivable portfolio and they assessed and independently approved our credit loss reserves.\nReserves against receivables modified in troubled debt restructurings were previously determined primarily by analysis of discounted expected cash flows and in certain cases was based on independent valuations of the underlying receivable collateral.\nFor more information about our charge-off and customer account management policies and practices, see \"Credit Quality - Delinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices,\" and \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices,\" in this MD&A.\nValuation of Financial Instruments We have established a control framework which is designed to ensure that fair values are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the determination of fair values rests with Finance. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee, a management committee comprised of senior executives in the Finance, Risk and other functions within HSBC North America, meets monthly to review, monitor and discuss significant valuation matters arising from credit and market risks. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWhere available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is measured using internally developed valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from and corroborated by market data or obtained from reputable third-party vendors. All of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value on a recurring basis are measured based on quoted market prices or observable independently-sourced market-based inputs. Where neither quoted market prices nor observable market parameters are available, fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management's expectation of the inputs that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. However, these unobservable inputs must incorporate market participants' assumptions about risks in the asset or liability and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear the risks. The determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment.\nWe review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs into a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a more detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, see \"Fair Value,\" in this MD&A.\nSignificant assets and liabilities recorded at fair value include the following:\nReceivables held for sale - Receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The estimated fair value of our receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources appropriate for the respective pools of assets aggregated by similar risk characteristics. These sources include recently observed over-the-counter transactions where available and fair value estimates obtained from an HSBC affiliate and a third party valuation specialist for distinct pools of receivables. These fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flow models using assumptions we believe are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such receivables and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades. Our valuation of receivables held for sale is based on aggregated pools of receivables to be sold by similar risk characteristics. The valuation of the receivables held for sale could be impacted in future periods if there are changes in how we expect to execute the receivable sales.\nValuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by investors in the current market given the specific characteristics and inherent credit risk of the receivables held for sale. Some of these inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. We perform analytical reviews of fair value changes on a quarterly basis and periodically validate our valuation methodologies and assumptions based on the results of actual sales of such receivables. We also may hold discussions on\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nvalue directly with potential investors. Since some receivables pools may have unique features, the fair value measurement process uses significant unobservable inputs specific to the performance characteristics of the various receivable portfolios.\nChanges in inputs, in particular in the rate of return that investors would require to purchase assets with the same characteristics and of the same credit quality, could significantly change the carrying amount of the receivables held for sale and related fair value adjustment recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a one percent decline in collateral values, based either on a current broker price opinion or the current estimated property value derived from the property's appraised value at the time of origination updated by a pricing index based on appropriate geographical data (such as the Case-Shiller Home Price Index), coupled with a one percent increase in the rate of return for real estate secured receivables held for sale would have resulted in an estimated decrease of the fair value of real estate secured receivables held for sale of approximately $250 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion including the valuation inputs used in valuing receivables held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities - We regularly use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy to protect future cash flows. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Related collateral that has been received or paid is netted against fair value for financial reporting purposes in those circumstances in which a master netting arrangement with the counterparty exists that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default or termination of any one contract. We believe that the valuation of derivative instruments is a critical accounting estimate because these instruments are valued using discounted cash flow modeling techniques or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity in lieu of observable market value quotes for identical or similar assets or liabilities in active and inactive markets. These modeling techniques require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows and use independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, when available. The valuation models and inputs are developed, reviewed, validated and approved by the Markets Independent Model Review Team of an HSBC affiliate. The models used apply appropriate control processes and procedures to ensure that the derived inputs are used to value only those instruments that share similar risk to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors.\nWe may adjust certain fair value estimates determined using valuation models to ensure that those estimates appropriately represent fair value. These adjustments, which are applied consistently over time, reflect factors such as the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Because of the interrelated nature, we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, model and data uncertainty risks. We also adjust fair value estimates determined using valuation models for counterparty credit risk and our own non-performance risk.\nWe utilize HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, \"HSBC Bank USA\") to determine the fair value of all of our derivatives using these modeling techniques. Significant changes in the fair value can result in equity and earnings volatility as follows:\n \u009f Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge are first recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, then recorded in earnings along with the cash flow effects of the hedged item. Ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. \n \u009f Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has not been designated or ceases to qualify as an effective hedge are reported in earnings.  A control framework has been established which is designed to ensure that fair values are validated by a function independent of the risk-taker. To that end, the ultimate responsibility for the measurement of fair values rests with the HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee. The HSBC U.S. Valuation Committee establishes policies and procedures to ensure appropriate valuations.\nWe test effectiveness for all derivatives designated as hedges under the \"long haul\" method both at inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis, to ascertain whether the derivative used in a hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment is conducted using statistical regression analysis. If we determine that a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting as of the beginning of the quarter in which such determination was made. We also believe the assessment of the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions is a critical accounting estimate due to the use of statistical regression analysis in making this determination. Inputs to statistical regression analysis require the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are susceptible to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates as well as the selection of a convention for the treatment of credit spreads in the analysis. Statistical regression analysis also involves the use of additional assumptions including the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ndetermination of the period over which the analysis should occur. The statistical regression analysis for our derivative instruments is performed by HSBC Bank USA.\nThe outcome of the statistical regression analysis can result in earnings volatility as the mark-to-market on derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges and the ineffectiveness associated with qualifying hedges are recorded in earnings. For example, a 10 percent adverse change in the value of our derivatives that do not qualify as effective hedges would have reduced gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives by approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor more information about our policies regarding the use of derivative instruments, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" and Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term debt carried at fair value - We have elected the fair value option for certain issuances of our fixed rate debt in order to align our accounting treatment with that of HSBC. Valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value both the interest rate component and the credit component of the debt. In many cases, management can obtain quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities but the markets may not be active, the prices may not be current, or such price quotations may differ substantially either over time or among market makers. Changes in such estimates, and in particular the credit component of the valuation, can be volatile from period to period and may impact the total mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value recorded in our consolidated statement of income (loss). For example, a 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in interest rates across all terms would have increased our reported mark-to-market by approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax credits and net operating and other losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, totaled $2,897 million and $2,923 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback available. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate.\nWe are included in HSBC North America's consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and in various combined State tax returns. We have entered into a tax allocation agreement with HSBC North America and its subsidiary entities which governs the current amount of taxes to be paid or received by the various entities and, therefore, we look at HSBC North America and its affiliates in reaching conclusions on recoverability. Based on our forecasts of future taxable income, we currently anticipate that HSBC North America's operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets.\nThe use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will affect taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance.\nOur interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate.\nThe carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is also determined by the enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate. Consequently, any changes in the U.S. corporate income tax rate will impact the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset. The new Administration in the U.S. has indicated an interest in significantly reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. Because we do not yet know the details of the new Administration's corporate tax plan, it is not possible to quantify the one-time impact from a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might ultimately result upon tax reform enactment. However, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could result in a decrease in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and a reduction to our net income and\n HSBC Finance Corporation \ntotal equity during the period in which any tax rate change is enacted. For example, a hypothetical 1 percent (100 basis point) decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 34 percent at December 31, 2016 would result in a write-down of our net deferred tax asset of approximately $80 million.\nAdditional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 can be found in Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nContingent Liabilities Both we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. Certain of these activities are or purport to be class actions seeking damages in significant amounts. These actions include assertions concerning violations of laws and/or unfair treatment of consumers. We have also been subject to various governmental and regulatory proceedings.\nWe estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from those estimates. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nLitigation and regulatory exposure is a critical accounting estimate because it represents key areas of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control. Due to the inherent uncertainties and other factors involved in such matters, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately prevail in each instance. Such uncertainties impact our ability to determine whether it is probable that a liability exists and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Also, as the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is influenced by factors that are outside of our control, it is reasonably possible our estimated liability under these proceedings may change. We will continue to update our accruals for these legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings as facts and circumstances change. See Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n Receivables Review \nThe following table summarizes receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n \n * Not meaningful \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nReal estate secured receivables held for investment The decrease since December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily reflects the decision to expand our receivable sales program in June 2015 and the decision in September 2016 to transfer all receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. To a lesser extent the decrease as compared with both periods also reflects continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. Liquidation rates in our real estate secured receivable portfolio continued to be impacted by low receivable prepayments as few refinancing opportunities exist for our customers.\nReceivables held for sale The decrease since December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of receivable sales during 2016 with a carrying value of $8,973 million, partially offset by the transfer of all receivables to held for sale during September 2016 as discussed above. The increase in receivables held for sale since December 31, 2014 reflects the changes to our receivable sales program in June 2015 and September 2016 as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of receivable sales during 2016 and 2015 with a carrying value of $8,973 million and $1,995 million, respectively. To a lesser extent, the increase was also partially offset by continued liquidation in the portfolio as well as the impact of additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments.\nIn response to the financial crisis, lenders have significantly tightened underwriting standards, substantially limiting the availability of alternative and subprime mortgages. As fewer financing options currently exist in the marketplace for home buyers, properties in certain markets are remaining on the market for longer periods of time which contributes to home price depreciation. For many of our customers, the ability to refinance and access equity in their homes is no longer an option. These industry trends continue to impact our portfolio and are reflected in additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of receivables held for sale, including a rollforward of the receivable held for sale balance for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n Results of Operations \nAs we continue to make progress in our strategy to sell our real estate secured receivable portfolio, we will see declines in net interest income. Decreases in operating expenses may not necessarily decline in line with the run-off and sale of our receivable portfolio as a result of certain fixed costs. Accordingly, net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2016 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nUnless noted otherwise, the following discusses amounts from continuing operations as reported in our consolidated statement of income.\nNet Interest Income The following table summarizes net interest income and net interest margin for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\n \n (1) % Columns: comparison to average interest-earning assets.  Net interest income decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower interest expense and higher overall yields on total interest earning assets as discussed in more detail below:\n \u009f Average receivable levels decreased in 2016 and 2015 as a result of receivable sales and continued liquidation of the receivable portfolio. \n \u009f Interest expense decreased during 2016 and 2015 as a result of lower average borrowings, partially offset by the impact of higher average rates due to the maturing of certain lower rate long-term borrowings in 2016 and 2015. Higher average rates in 2016 also reflect the impact of increases in rates on certain variable rate debt during the first quarter of 2016. \n \u009f Overall yields on total average interest earning assets increased during 2016 and 2015 driven by a shift in mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments which have significantly lower yields than our receivable portfolio as well as higher receivable yields. Receivable yields increased during 2016 and 2015 due to the impact of lower levels of nonaccrual real estate secured receivables, partially offset in 2016 by a lower impact from changes in yield assumptions on receivables participating in payment incentive programs. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nNet interest margin was 3.41 percent in 2016 compared with 2.75 percent in 2015 and 2.68 percent in 2014. The increase in net interest margin during 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of higher overall yields on total average interest earning assets due to a shift in the mix of total average interest earning assets to a lower percentage of short-term investments and higher receivable yields as discussed above. Net interest margin in 2016 also reflects an improved cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets as interest expense decreased at a faster pace than average interest earning assets in spite of higher average rates in 2016 as discussed above. In 2015, the improvement in net interest margin was partially offset by a higher cost of funds as a percentage of average interest earning assets as a result of higher average rates as discussed above.\nThe following table summarizes the significant trends affecting the comparability of net interest income and net interest margin:\n\nThe varying maturities and repricing frequencies of both our assets and liabilities expose us to interest rate risk. When the various risks inherent in both the asset and the debt do not meet our desired risk profile, we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks to acceptable interest rate risk levels. See \"Risk Management\" for additional information regarding interest rate risk and derivative financial instruments.\nProvision for Credit Losses The following table summarizes provision for credit losses by product:\n\nThe provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The provision for credit losses in both 2016 and 2015 was impacted by the recording of lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments related to credit factors on receivables transferred to held for sale, although the impact was more pronounced in 2016 as a result of the decision in September 2016 to transfer to held for sale all of the receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio. These adjustments reflect the differences between amortized cost and the amount we believe a third party investor would pay to acquire the receivables, which takes into consideration factors that are not relevant under the incurred loss model in establishing credit loss reserves for receivables held for investment, such as life time losses and the discounting of cash flows. When there is no objective, verifiable evidence to indicate non-credit factors are present, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of provision for credit losses.\nThe remainder of the provision for credit losses was also higher during 2016 as compared with 2015. While both periods were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels and the impact of lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days delinquent, as well as lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, the impact was more pronounced during 2015. Additionally, the provision for credit losses during 2015 was also impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio.\nNet charge-off dollars totaled $932 million during 2016 compared with $2,156 million during 2015. Dollars of net charge-offs during both periods were impacted by lower receivable levels subsequent to the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of the transfer of receivables to held for sale are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled $268 million during 2016 compared with $1,622 million during 2015. Additionally, the credit portion of the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nlower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $576 million during 2016 compared with $234 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of charge-off dollars associated with receivables transferred to held for sale during both periods, dollars of net charge-offs decreased during 2016 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices during 2016. See \"Credit Quality\" for further discussion of our net charge-offs.\nSubsequent to the transfer of receivables to held for sale, no further provision for credit losses or charge-offs are recorded as receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As a result of transferring all the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no provision for credit losses or charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe following discusses our provision for credit losses by product for 2015 as compared with 2014:\n \u009f The provision for credit losses for real estate secured receivables increased during 2015 largely due to the impact of our expanded receivable sales program which resulted in a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million related to credit factors as discussed above. Excluding the impact of this item, the provision for credit losses remained higher during 2015. Both 2015 and 2014 were positively impacted by lower loss estimates due to lower receivable levels, lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, and improved credit quality, including lower dollars of delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent, although the impact to the provision for credit losses was more pronounced during 2014. Additionally, 2015 was impacted by a release of approximately $19 million associated with a correction to our credit loss reserve calculation for a segment of our portfolio. \n \u009f The provision for credit losses for personal non-credit card receivables for 2014 reflects recoveries received from borrowers on fully charged-off personal non-credit card receivables that were not previously sold as well as cash proceeds in 2014 received from the bulk sale of recovery rights of certain previously charged-off personal non-credit card receivables.  The provision for credit losses for 2014 also reflects the sale of recovery rights in May 2014 for receivables with outstanding balances of $3.3 billion which had previously been fully-charged off. The cash proceeds from this transaction of $57 million were recorded as a recovery of charged-off receivables during 2014.\nNet charge-offs totaled $2,156 million during 2015 compared with $693 million during 2014. Net charge-offs during 2015 were significantly impacted by the expansion of our receivable sales program during 2015 as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer associated with receivables transferred to held for sale are recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $1,622 million during 2015 compared with $58 million during 2014. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $234 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of dollars of charge-offs related to receivables transferred to held for sale in both periods, net charge-offs decreased during 2015 reflecting lower receivable levels and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency as a result of improvements home prices since December 31, 2014 and improvements in economic conditions. See \"Credit Quality\" for further discussion of our net charge-offs.\nOther Revenues The following table summarizes the components of other revenues:\n\nDerivative related expense includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives which did not qualify as effective hedges under hedge accounting principles and ineffectiveness on derivatives which are qualifying hedges. Designation of swaps as effective hedges reduces the volatility that would otherwise result from mark-to-market accounting. All derivatives are economic hedges of the underlying debt instruments regardless of the accounting treatment. The following table summarizes derivative related expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n\nWe previously entered into interest rate swaps which were not designated as hedges under derivative accounting principles. These financial instruments were economic hedges but did not qualify for hedge accounting and were primarily used to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates through more closely matching both the structure and duration of our liabilities to the structure and duration of our assets. As we continued to accelerate the run-off and sale of our real estate secured receivable portfolio, the dynamics of the duration of our receivables changed due to lower prepayment rates and the corresponding increase in interest rate risk. As a result, in 2015, we began reducing the size of this portfolio of interest rate swaps. In May 2016, we terminated all of the remaining interest rate swaps in this portfolio of non-qualifying hedges. As a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio, derivative related income (expense) in future periods will only reflect ineffectiveness for derivatives that are qualifying hedges.\nDerivative related expense deteriorated during 2016 compared with 2015. The components of derivative related expense are discussed below:\n \u009f Net realized losses improved during 2016 as a result of fewer non-qualifying hedges outstanding during the year. \n \u009f Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio deteriorated during 2016 compared with 2015 reflecting the impact of falling rates which had occurred prior to the termination of the swaps and was more pronounced than the impact of falling rates in 2015. \n \u009f Hedge accounting ineffectiveness was primarily related to our cross currency cash flow hedges that are approaching maturity.  Derivative related expense improved during 2015 compared with 2014. The components of derivative related expense are discussed below:\n \u009f Net realized losses improved modestly during 2015 as a result of fewer non-qualifying hedges outstanding during the year. \n \u009f Mark-to-market on derivatives in our non-qualifying hedge portfolio reflects the impact of falling long-term interest rates during both 2015 and 2014, although the impact was more pronounced in 2014. \n \u009f Hedge accounting ineffectiveness was primarily related to our cross currency cash flow hedges.  Net income volatility in future periods has been reduced as a result of the elimination of our non-qualifying hedge portfolio. Derivative related expense for 2016 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nGain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives reflects fair value changes on our fixed rate debt accounted for under fair value option as well as the fair value changes and realized gains (losses) on the related derivatives associated with debt designated at fair value. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives decreased during 2016 primarily due to lower net realized gains as a result of fewer derivative positions during the year as our fair value option debt and related derivatives mature as well as a tightening of our credit spreads. Gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives improved modestly during 2015 as a result of the impact of a widening of our credit spreads during 2015 and the impact of changes in market movements on certain debt and related derivatives that mature in the near term, partially offset by lower realized gains on the related derivatives as a result of fewer derivative positions as discussed above. See Note 9, \"Fair Value Option,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information, including a break out of the components of the gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives.\nNet income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. The gain on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nServicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates represents revenue received under service level agreements under which we service real estate secured receivables as well as rental revenue from HSBC Technology & Services (USA) Inc. (\"HTSU\") for certain office and administrative costs. Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower rental income as a result of the sale of a data center located in Vernon Hills, Illinois to HTSU during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nin 2016, servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6 million as a result of prepaying a $512 million draw on a credit agreement with an affiliate in December 2016.\nLower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale during 2016, 2015 and 2014 is summarized in the following table:\n\nDuring 2016, we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables transferred to held for sale totaling $587 million of which $11 million was attributable to non-credit factors and recorded as a component of other revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss). The remainder of the total initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment for 2016 of $576 million was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses. During 2015, we recorded an initial lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of $234 million all of which was attributed to credit factors and recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses.\nDuring 2016, we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment subsequent to the initial transfer to held for sale totaling $201 million of which $263 million was attributable to fair value adjustments primarily as a result of establishing separate pools for receivables being marketed. Removing these receivables from their risk-based grouping impacts the valuation of the receivables remaining in the risked-based pools. This was partially offset by the impact of settlements resulting from receivable payoffs or the transfer of receivables to REO totaling $62 million. During 2015, we recorded an additional lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment on receivables held for sale totaling $130 million of which $155 million related to changes in fair value and $25 million related to settlements.\nSee Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.\nGain on sale of real estate secured receivables increased during 2016 and decreased during 2015. The following table summarizes receivables sold by period.\n\nDifferences in the gain on sale of real estate secured receivables realized between years reflects both differences in the relative size of the receivable pools sold as well as differences in the composition of the receivable pools sold. The increase in 2016 also reflects improved pricing during the year, particularly during the fourth quarter.\nOther income decreased during 2016 and increased during 2015. All periods were impacted by changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities. Excluding the impact of changes in the provision for estimated repurchase liabilities from all periods, other income was essentially flat during 2016 and 2015.\nOur reserve for potential repurchase liability represents our best estimate of the loss that has been incurred resulting from various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our receivable sales. Because the level of receivable repurchase losses are dependent upon strategies for bringing claims or pursuing legal action for losses incurred, the level of the liability for receivables repurchase losses requires significant judgment. As such, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates making it reasonably possible that they could change. During the third quarter of 2015, management concluded that, due to new developments in case law and other factors, it was appropriate to release the repurchase reserve liability related to receivables sold by Decision One Mortgage Company LLC prior to the third quarter of 2007. The following table summarizes the changes in our reserve for potential repurchase liability related to our receivable sales:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n\nOperating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses. The cost trends in the table below include fixed allocated costs which will not necessarily decline in line with the run-off of our receivable portfolio in future periods.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits in 2016 and 2015 decreased due to the impact of the continuing reduced scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. Salary and employee benefits in both 2016 and 2015 were impacted by severance costs resulting from changes in our receivable sales program in September 2016 and June 2015, respectively. Severance costs during 2016 totaled $21 million compared with $34 million in 2015.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses, net decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as a result of the sale of a data center during the third quarter of 2015 as discussed above as well as lower rent, repair and utility costs reflecting the impact of the continuing reduced scope of our business operations.\nReal estate owned expenses decreased during 2016 driven by fewer average numbers of REO properties held during the year. Additionally, REO expenses in 2015 benefited from an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million as discussed below. During 2016, we brought the servicing of our entire REO portfolio in-house.\nReal estate owned expenses were impacted during 2015 by an adjustment to the final charge-off calculation at the time of foreclosure for certain receivables in prior periods. This resulted in an out of period reduction in REO expense of approximately $7 million when the REO properties associated with these receivables were sold. Excluding the impact of this item, REO expenses increased during 2015 driven by lower gains on sales of REO properties during 2015 as a result of a significant decrease in the number of REO properties sold during 2015. The increase in 2015 was partially offset by the impact of lower estimated losses due to continuing improvements in the housing market in 2015 and lower holding costs due to fewer average numbers of REO properties held during 2015 and lower costs per property.\nSupport services from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2016 and 2015 due to lower technology costs from an HSBC affiliate and lower fees for receivable servicing by HSBC affiliates as a result of the sale of receivables during 2016 and 2015. The decrease during 2016 also reflects the impact of terminating a guarantee during the third quarter of 2015 related to a surety bond.\nProvision for securities litigation liability As discussed more fully in Note 20, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in June 2016, we agreed to pay $1,575 million to settle all claims of the outstanding securities litigation. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for securities litigation liability of $575 million and $700 million, respectively.\nOther expenses decreased during 2016 reflecting lower litigation costs as well as the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in file review costs related to our receivable sales program.\nOther expenses increased during 2015 reflecting the impact of higher litigation costs, partially offset by lower fees for consulting services as well as lower third-party collection fees resulting from lower foreclosure activities as we have fewer receivables in the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nprocess of foreclosure as a result of the receivable sales program. Other expenses in 2015 was also positively impacted by the continuing reduction in the scope of our business operations and the impact of entity-wide initiatives to reduce costs.\nIncome taxes Our effective tax rate was (31.7) percent in 2016 compared with (54.5) percent in 2015 and 29.1 percent in 2014. For a complete analysis of the differences between effective tax rates based on the total income tax provision attributable to pre-tax income and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate, see Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations intended to discourage corporate inversions by re-characterizing certain inter-company debt as equity, effectively eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid to related parties under certain circumstances. Final and temporary regulations were released in October 2016 that exempt regulated financial groups such as HSBC and its affiliates from those re-characterization rules. Certain documentation rules included in the regulations will apply to HSBC and its affiliates, and we will analyze the requirements in order to implement the regulations on a timely basis in accordance with the rules. We do not anticipate a significant financial accounting impact upon implementation of the regulations.\n Credit Quality \nCredit Loss Reserves As previously discussed, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale. As a result, our entire receivable portfolio is now classified as held for sale which is carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer has any associated credit loss reserves as any adjustments to the carrying value are reflected in other income. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in this MD&A and Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on our policies for establishing credit loss reserves prior to September 2016.\nThe table below sets forth credit loss reserves and credit loss reserve ratios for the historical periods indicated. The transfer to held for sale of the remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment in September 2016 has resulted in our entire receivable portfolio being carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and no longer have any associated credit loss reserves. Transfers of receivables to held for sale impacts comparability between credit loss reserves and the related reserve ratios between periods.\n\n \n (1) At December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, credit loss reserves includes $12 million, $33 million, $52 million and $132 million, respectively, related to receivables held for investment which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell primarily reflecting an estimate of additional loss following an interior appraisal of the property. \n (2) Reserves associated with accrued finance charges, which totaled $51 million, $323 million, $326 million and $360 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are reported within our total credit loss reserve balances noted above, although receivables and nonaccrual receivables as reported generally exclude accrued finance charges. The credit loss reserve ratios presented in the tables above exclude any reserves associated with accrued finance charges. \n (3) Credit loss reserve ratios exclude receivables and nonaccrual receivables associated with receivable portfolios which are considered held for sale as these receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value with no corresponding credit loss reserves. \n (4) These ratios are impacted by changes in the level of real estate secured receivables held for investment which have been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies and are not classified as held for sale. The following table shows these ratios excluding these receivables and any associated credit loss reserves for all periods presented. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2015 are not comparable with December 31, 2014 as a result of the expansion of the receivable sales program in June 2015. Credit loss reserves associated with all receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale during 2015 totaled $1,622 million and were recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale. Credit loss reserves at December 31, 2015 were also positively impacted by lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2014 decreased as compared with December 31, 2013 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2014 due to lower levels of TDR Loans as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional real estate secured receivables during 2014 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $58 million during 2014 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserves at December 31, 2013 decreased as compared with December 31, 2012 due to lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans, lower receivable levels and lower levels of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent. Reserve requirements on TDR Loans were lower at December 31, 2013 due to lower levels of new TDR Loan volumes as well as the impact of improvements in loss and severity estimates based on recent trends in the portfolio. The decrease also reflects the transfer to held for sale of additional pools of real estate secured receivables during 2013 which had been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as previously discussed. Credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to their transfer to held for sale totaled $164 million during 2013 and was recognized as an additional charge-off at the time of the transfer to held for sale.\nCredit loss reserve ratios Following is a discussion of changes in the reserve ratios we previously considered in establishing reserve levels. As discussed above, in September 2016 we transferred all remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale and we no longer have any credit loss reserves. Accordingly, there are no credit loss reserve ratios at December 31, 2016.\nReserves as a percentage of receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015 decreased significantly as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables as the majority of the receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as part of the expansion of the receivable sales program were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2014 as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, largely due to the lower reserve requirements on TDR Loans and improved credit quality as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in receivables. Reserves as a percentage of receivables were lower at December 31, 2013 as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in receivables.\nReserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables held for investment were impacted by nonaccrual real estate secured receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2015 decreased as compared with December 31, 2014 as the decrease in credit loss reserves outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables as the majority of the nonaccrual receivables transferred to held for sale in June 2015 as discussed above were classified as TDR Loans which carry higher reserve requirements. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2014 were higher as compared with December 31, 2013 as the decrease in nonaccrual receivables, as discussed more fully below, outpaced the decrease in credit loss reserves. Excluding receivables carried at fair value of the collateral less cost to sell and any associated credit loss reserves from these ratios, reserves as a percentage of nonaccrual receivables at December 31, 2013 were lower as compared with December 31, 2012 as the decrease in credit loss reserves, driven by the lower reserve requirement for TDR Loans as discussed above, outpaced the decrease in nonaccrual receivables.\nSee Note 6, \"Credit Loss Reserves,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of credit loss reserves by product for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nDelinquency and Charge-off Policies and Practices Our delinquency and net charge-off ratios reflect, among other factors, changes in the quality of our receivables, transfers of receivables to held for sale, the average age of our receivables, the success of our collection and customer account management efforts, general economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, interest rates, unemployment rates, any changes to our charge-off policies and significant catastrophic events such as natural disasters and global pandemics. See Note 2,\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our charge-off and nonaccrual policies.\nDelinquency Our policies and practices for the collection of receivables, including our customer account management policies and practices, permit us to modify the terms of receivables, either temporarily or permanently (a \"modification\"), and/or to reset the contractual delinquency status of an account that is contractually delinquent to current (a \"re-age\"), based on indicators or criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability. Such policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure or repossession as determined to be appropriate. If a re-aged account subsequently experiences payment defaults, it will again become contractually delinquent and be included in our delinquency ratios.\nThe table below summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency for receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percent of receivables and receivables held for sale (\"delinquency ratio\"). As previously discussed, in June 2015 we expanded our receivable sales program and in September 2016 we transferred all of the remaining receivables classified as held for investment to held for sale which must be considered in comparing dollars of contractual delinquency and the delinquency ratio between the periods presented.\n\n \n (1) The receivables held for investment balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. \n (2) Two-months-and-over contractually delinquent receivables are classified as \"late stage delinquency\" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the amounts above include $23 million and $60 million, respectively, of receivables that at some point in their life cycle were written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 60 and 180 days past due. \n (3) Amount includes TDR Loans which totaled $131 million and $297 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. \n (4) This amount represents delinquent receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. For TDR Loans we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nimpairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals.\n (5) This amount represents delinquent receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. \n (6) At December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, dollars of contractual delinquency for receivable held for sale includes $333 million, $443 million and $381 million, respectively, of real estate secured receivables which are also classified as TDR Loans.  Dollars of delinquency and the delinquency ratio for real estate secured receivables held for investment At December 31, 2016, there were no dollars of delinquency or delinquency ratio for receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.\nDollars of delinquency for receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 decreased as compared with December 31, 2015 as a result of receivables sold during 2016 and improvements in credit quality, partially offset by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio.\nDelinquency ratio for real estate secured receivables held for sale The delinquency ratio for receivables held for sale was 8.05 percent at December 31, 2016 compared with 6.88 percent December 31, 2015. The increase as compared to December 31, 2015 reflects the impact of real estate secured receivable sales during 2016 as a significant portion of the receivables sold were less than 30 days contractually delinquent which results in receivables held for sale decreasing at a faster pace than dollars of delinquency. Additionally, the transfer to held for sale of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio in September 2016 also impacts the comparability of the delinquency ratio between periods.\nSee \"Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" regarding the delinquency treatment of re-aged and modified accounts.\nNet Charge-offs The following table summarizes net charge-off of receivables both in dollars and as a percent of average receivables (\"net charge-off ratio\"). During a quarter in which receivables are transferred to receivables held for sale, those receivables continue to be included in the average receivable balances prior to such transfer and any charge-off related to those receivables prior to such transfer, including the recognition of existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer and the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment, if any, remain in our net charge-off totals. However, in the quarter following the transfer to held for sale classification, the receivables are no longer included in average receivables as such receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and, accordingly, there are no further charge-offs associated with these receivables. As a result, the amounts and ratios presented below are not comparable between periods.\n\n \n (1) Although we sold our personal non-credit card receivable portfolio on April 1, 2013, subsequent to April 1, 2013 we continued to receive recoveries on personal non-credit card receivables that were fully charged-off prior to the sale of the portfolio. These recoveries are reflected in the table above. As these personal non-credit card receivables were fully charged-off with no carrying value remaining on our consolidated balance sheet, a net charge-off ratio for our personal non-credit card receivable portfolio cannot be calculated for 2014. However, the recoveries for personal non-credit card receivables are reflected in the total net charge-off ratio for 2014.  Net real estate secured receivable charge-offs dollars for all periods were impacted by the transfer of additional receivables to held for sale. Credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer are recorded as additional charge-off upon transfer and totaled $268 million, $1,622 million and $58 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Additionally, the credit portion of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded at the time of transfer to receivables held for sale was recorded as additional charge-off and totaled $576 million and $234 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was not a credit related lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded during 2014. Net charge-off dollars for 2016 also includes an out of period\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nadjustment which decreased net charge-offs by $12 million in order to properly reflect charge-offs for receivables which received a partial forgiveness of principal as a result of an account modification.\nExcluding the impact to net charge-off dollars related of the items discussed above, net charge-offs dollars remained lower in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting lower levels of receivables held for investment and lower charge-off on accounts that reach 180 days contractual delinquency reflecting improved credit quality as a result of improvements in economic conditions and home prices. As a result of transferring all of the remaining receivables held for investment to held for sale in September 2016, no additional charge-offs will be recorded in future periods.\nThe net real estate secured receivable charge-off ratio for 2016 increased as compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above.\nReal estate charge-offs and REO expenses as a percentage of average real estate secured receivables for 2016 increased compared with 2015 and 2014 reflecting the impact of lower average receivable levels, partially offset by the impact of lower dollars of net charge-offs as discussed above and lower REO expenses. See \"Results of Operations\" for further discussion of REO expense.\nNonperforming Assets As previously discussed, during the third quarter of 2016 we transferred to held for sale all remaining receivables classified as held for investment which must be considered in comparing nonperforming assets between periods. Nonperforming assets consisted of the following for the periods presented:\n\n \n (1) The receivable balances included in this table reflect the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but exclude any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balances in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale have been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer. Nonaccrual receivables reflect all receivables which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as second lien receivables (regardless of delinquency status) where the first lien receivable that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. Nonaccrual receivables held for investment and held for sale do not include receivables totaling $252 million, $501 million and $627 million at December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, which are less than 90 days contractually delinquent and not accruing interest. In addition, nonaccrual receivables do not include receivables which have made qualifying payments and have been re-aged and the contractual delinquency status reset to current as such activity, in our judgment, evidences continued payment probability. If a re-aged receivable subsequently experiences payment default and becomes 90 or more days contractually delinquent, it will be reported as nonaccrual. \n (2) Nonaccrual receivables are classified as \"late stage delinquency\" if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the amounts above include $15 million and $35 million, respectively, of receivables held for investment that at some point in their life cycle were evaluated for write-down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies, but are currently between 90 and 180 days past due. \n (3) This amount includes TDR Loans which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell which totaled $124 million at December 31, 2015 and $274 million at December 31, 2014. \n (4) This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which have been classified as TDR Loans and carried at amortized cost and which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent. This amount represents TDR Loans for which we evaluate reserves using a discounted cash flow methodology. Each receivable is individually identified as a TDR Loan and then grouped together with other TDR Loans with similar characteristics. The discounted cash flow impairment analysis is then applied to these groups of TDR Loans. This amount excludes TDR Loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell as they are reflected in the late stage delinquency totals. \n (5) This amount represents nonaccrual receivables which at no point in its life cycle have ever been greater than 180 days contractually delinquent and are not classified as TDR Loans. As discussed more fully above, for these receivables we establish credit loss reserves using a roll rate migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off based upon recent historical performance experience of other receivables in our portfolio. \n (6) At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual second lien real estate secured receivables held for investment totaled $63 million and $122 million, respectively. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n (7) At December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual receivables held for sale include $272 million, $285 million and $362 million, respectively, of real estate secured receivables held for sale which are also classified as TDR Loans.  Nonaccrual real estate secured receivables held for investment At December 31, 2016, there were no nonaccrual receivables held for investment as all receivables are classified as held for sale.\nNonaccrual receivables held for sale decreased modestly at December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 as the impact of receivables sold during 2016 and improvements in credit quality were largely offset by the transfer to held for sale in September 2016 of all receivables remaining in our held for investment portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, nonaccrual receivables and receivables held for sale in the table above include TDR Loans totaling $272 million, $463 million and $1,101 million, respectively, some of which at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are carried at the lower of amortized cost of the fair value of the collateral less cost sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies. See Note 5, \"Receivables Held for Investment, net,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding TDR Loan balances.\nCustomer Account Management Policies and Practices Our policies and practices focus on ethical and effective collection and customer account management efforts for each receivable. Our customer account management policies and practices permit us to take action with respect to delinquent or troubled accounts based on criteria which, in our judgment, evidence continued payment probability, as well as a continuing desire for borrowers to stay in their homes. The policies and practices are designed to manage customer relationships, improve collection opportunities and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate. From time to time we re-evaluate these policies and procedures and make changes as deemed appropriate.\nCurrently, we utilize the following account management actions:\n \u2022 Modification - Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable either temporarily or permanently without changing the delinquency status of the receivable. Modifications may include changes to one or more terms of the receivable including, but not limited to, a change in interest rate, extension of the amortization period, reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal. \n \u2022 Collection Re-age - Management action that results in the resetting of the contractual delinquency status of an account to current but does not involve any changes to the original terms and conditions of the receivable. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent. We use collection re-aging as an account and customer management tool in an effort to increase the cash flow from our account relationships, and accordingly, the application of this tool is subject to complexities, variations and changes from time to time. \n \u2022 Modification Re-age - Management action that results in a change to the terms and conditions of the receivable, either temporarily or permanently, and also resets the contractual delinquency status of an account to current as discussed above. If an account which has been re-aged subsequently experiences a payment default, it will again become contractually delinquent.  Our account management programs include certain eligibility criteria, including time since last account management action, minimum qualifying payment required and a maximum number of account management actions during a five year period.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nThe following table shows the number of real estate secured accounts remaining in our portfolio (including receivables held for sale) as well as the outstanding receivable balance of these accounts as of the period indicated for receivables for which we have taken an account management action by the type of action taken, some of which may have received multiple account management actions.\n\n \n (1) The outstanding receivable balance included in this table reflects the principal amount outstanding on the receivable net of any charge-off recorded in accordance with our existing charge-off policies but excludes any basis adjustments to the receivable such as unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated receivables, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and premiums or discounts on purchased receivables. Additionally, the balance in this table related to receivables which have been classified as held for sale has been reduced by the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment recorded as well as the credit loss reserves associated with these receivables prior to the transfer.  The following table provides information regarding the delinquency status of receivables remaining in the portfolio that were granted modifications of loan terms and/or re-aged as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 in the categories shown above:\n\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nThe following table provides information regarding real estate secured modified and/or re-aged receivables during 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n \n (1) Includes collection re-age only, modification only, and modification re-ages. \n (2) Includes amounts received under a short sale whereby the property is sold by the borrower at a price which has been pre-negotiated with us and the borrower is released from further obligation. \n (3) Amounts include the credit loss reserves existing at the time of transfer of receivables to held for sale which are recognized as charge-off. Amounts also include the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for receivables transferred to held for sale. See Note 6, \"Credit Loss Reserves,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  The following table summarizes receivables modified during 2016 and 2015 some of which may have also been re-aged:\n\n \n (1) Includes all receivables modified during 2016 and 2015 regardless of whether the receivable was also re-aged. \n (2) If qualification criteria are met, receivable modification may occur on more than one occasion for the same account. For purposes of the table above, an account is only included in the modification totals once in an annual period and not for each separate modification in an annual period.  Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or having similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\nOur receivable portfolio is comprised of loans to non-prime consumers. Such customers are individuals who have limited credit histories, modest incomes, high debt-to-income ratios or have experienced credit problems evidenced by occasional delinquencies, prior charge-offs, bankruptcy or other credit related actions. The majority of our secured receivables have high loan-to-value ratios.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nBecause our lending activities were primarily to individual consumers, we do not have receivables from any industry group that equal or exceed 10 percent of total receivables at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The following table reflects the percentage of receivables (including receivables held for investment and held for sale) by state which individually account for 5 percent or greater of our portfolio.\n\n Liquidity and Capital Resources \nHSBC Finance Corporation HSBC Finance Corporation, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc., is the parent company that owns the outstanding common stock of its subsidiaries.\nHSBC Finance Corporation has a number of obligations to meet with its available cash. It must be able to fund its operations, service its debt obligations and pay dividends to its preferred stockholder. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock in 2016 or 2015. We maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process.\nHSBC Finance Corporation manages all of its operations directly and in 2016, funded these businesses primarily through proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and REO sales proceeds.\nAt various times, we make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support operations or provide funding for long-term facilities and technological improvements. During 2016 and 2015, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries were more than offset by dividends paid to HSBC Finance Corporation.\nHSBC Related Funding We work with our affiliates under the oversight of HSBC North America to maximize funding opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC's operations in the United States. All of our ongoing funding requirements have been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and our funding requirements are sourced primarily through HSBC USA or HSBC North America.\nDue to affiliates totaled $3,300 million and $5,925 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The interest rates on funding from HSBC subsidiaries are market-based and comparable to those available from unaffiliated parties.\nIn July 2016, we prepaid a $600 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In October 2016, we prepaid a $1,000 million loan agreement with HSBC North America. In December 2016, we prepaid $512 million that was outstanding under a credit agreement with HSBC USA.\nSee Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our funding arrangements with HSBC affiliates, including derivatives.\nShort-Term Investments Securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled $2,392 million and $2,724 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Interest bearing deposits at banks totaled $1,500 million at December 31, 2016 and were with HSBC Bank USA. We did not have any interest bearing deposits at banks at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments increased as compared with December 31, 2015 reflecting cash received from receivable sales, partially offset by the retirement of debt, payment of the securities litigation settlement and the redemption of the Series B preferred stock.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nLong-Term Debt (excluding amounts due to affiliates) decreased to $4,340 million at December 31, 2016 from $9,510 million at December 31, 2015. There were no issuances of long-term debt during 2016 or 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $5,107 million and $6,546 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSecured financings previously issued under public trusts of $404 million at December 31, 2016 are secured by $750 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016. Secured financings previously issued under public trusts of $879 million at December 31, 2015 were secured by $1,654 million of closed-end real estate secured receivables which are classified as receivables held for investment at December 31, 2015.\nIn order to eliminate future foreign exchange risk, currency swaps were used at the time of issuance of all foreign-denominated notes to fix the notes in U.S. dollars.\nWe have used derivatives for managing interest rate and currency risk and have received loan commitments from affiliates, but we do not otherwise enter into off-balance sheet transactions.\nPreferred Stock In November 2010, we issued 1,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to an affiliate for $1.0 billion. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and payable quarterly at a rate of 8.625 percent. During years in which there is an accumulated deficit, dividends on the Series C preferred stock are paid from additional paid-in-capital. The Series C preferred stock may be redeemed at our option after November 30, 2025.\nIn June 2005, we issued 575,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $575 million. On June 30, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million.\nSee Note 12, \"Redeemable Preferred Stock,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommon Equity During 2016 and 2015, we did not receive any capital contributions.\nEquity ratio Common and preferred equity to total assets totaled 39.14 percent at December 31, 2016 compared with 27.48 percent at December 31, 2015.\nHSBC North America continues to review the composition of its capital structure following the adoption by the U.S. banking regulators of the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which were effective as of January 1, 2014. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, we have replaced instruments whose treatment was less favorable under the new rules with Basel III compliant instruments. Any required funding has been, or will be, integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates.\nHSBC North America participates in the FRB's CCAR program and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run stress test results in April 2016. In June 2016, the FRB informed HSBC North America that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2016 CCAR submission. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity.\n2017 Funding Strategy The following table summarizes our current range of estimates for funding needs and sources for 2017:\n\n \n (1) Primarily reflects miscellaneous cash provided by operating activities.  For 2017, we expect proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition will generate the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nliquidity necessary to meet our maturing debt obligations.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures in 2016 and 2015 totaled $1 million and $1 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2017 are not expected to be significant.\nCommitments We entered into commitments to meet the financing needs of our customers. In some cases, we have the ability to reduce or eliminate these open lines of credit. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $70 million and $88 million, respectively, of open consumer lines of credit.\nContractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our long-term contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2016 by period due:\n\n \n (1) Maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2016 include secured financings based on the anticipated clean-up date for the collateralized funding transaction. \n (2) The expected benefit payments included in the table above includes both continuing and discontinued operations as well as a future service component.  These cash obligations could be funded through proceeds of sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs and REO sales, funding from affiliates or capital contributions from HSBC.\nThe pension obligation for our employees are the contractual obligation of HSBC North America and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.\nOur purchase obligations for goods and services at December 31, 2016 were not significant.\n Fair Value \nNet income volatility arising from changes in either interest rate or credit components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives or changes in the fair value of receivables held for sale, REO or receivables carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell affects the comparability of reported results between periods. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.\nFair Value Hierarchy Accounting principles related to fair value measurements establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the \"Fair Value Framework\"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy:\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services; \n \u009f whether the instrument is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price that is readily available; \n \u009f the size of transactions occurring in an active market; \n \u009f the level of bid-ask spreads; \n \u009f a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, market liquidity; \n \u009f whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time; \n \u009f whether the inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and \n \u009f whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value.  Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for the identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume.\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We generally classify derivative contracts as well as our own debt issuance for which we have elected fair value option as Level 2 measurements. These valuations are typically obtained from a third party valuation source which, in the case of derivatives, includes valuations provided by HSBC Bank USA.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis totaling $5,674 million (41 percent of total assets) and $8,265 million (34 percent of total assets), respectively. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nClassification within the fair value hierarchy is based on whether the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. As such, the classification within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic and can be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period. Transfers between leveling categories are assessed, determined and recognized at the end of each reporting period.\nSee Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details including our valuation techniques as well as the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Additionally, see Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements and transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 measurements during 2016 and 2015.\n Risk Management \nOverview Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. To do so, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. This framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also ensures that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. We strive to continuously improve our risk management processes through ongoing employee training and development.\nOur risk management framework is underpinned by a strong risk culture and reinforced by our values and standards. These are instrumental in aligning the behaviors of individuals with our attitude to assuming and managing risk and ensuring that our risk profile remains in line with our risk appetite. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that ensures appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk.\nOur Board of Directors and its committees, principally the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committees, have oversight responsibility for the effective management of risk. The Risk Committee advises the Board of Directors on our business run-off strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nManagement is accountable for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of our risk management policies. Day-to-day risk management activities are the responsibility of senior managers of individual businesses, supported by HSBC global functions. We use the Three Lines of Defense (\"LoD\") model to underpin our approach to strong risk management. It defines who is responsible to do what to identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor, and mitigate risks, encouraging collaboration and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to risk ownership and risk management. Decisions are not taken by committees, but by specific individuals, in accordance with the Three LoD model, to promote clear accountability. The Board and its sub-committees remain collective decision-making bodies. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model.\nOur Risk Management function is headed by our Chief Risk Officer, who is responsible for the risk management framework. This includes establishing policies, monitoring of risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management policies resides with the Chief Risk Officer supported by the Risk Management Meeting (\"RMM\") of the HSBC Finance Corporation Executive Committee (\"EXCO\"). EXCO is the senior most management committee at HSBC Finance Corporation and the RMM is its meeting to discuss risk matters.\nSpecific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following HSBC North America or Risk Committees:\n \u009f the HSBC North America Asset Liability Committee (\"HSBC North America ALCO\"); \n \u009f the Operational Risk Committee; \n \u009f the HSBC North America Third Party Risk Oversight Committee; \n \u009f the HSBC North America Capital Management Committee; \n \u009f the Regulatory Compliance Governance Committee; and \n \u009f the Financial Crime Compliance (\"FCC\") Governance Committee.  Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities as it relates to risk oversight.\nHSBC North America ALCO provides oversight of all liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the HSBC North America Chief Financial Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are members of the HSBC North America ALCO. Subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and HSBC Group, the HSBC North America ALCO advises the Chief Financial Officer of HSBC North America in setting the limits of acceptable risk, monitoring the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assessing the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. The HSBC North America ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity.\nMaintaining a conservative risk profile is a core part of our philosophy. This encompasses maintaining a strong capital position and having effective liquidity and funding management. Additionally, we have zero tolerance for the following:\n \u009f knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated; \n \u009f operating without the appropriate systems and controls in place to prevent and detect financial crime; \n \u009f deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers arising from our operations or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements; and \n \u009f inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by our operations.  The principal risks associated with our operations include the following:\n \u009f Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract; \n \u009f Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself; \n \u009f Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios; \n \u009f Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to rate movements; \n \u009f Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events (including legal risk); \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n \u009f Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation; \n \u009f Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences; \n \u009f Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; \n \u009f Security and Fraud risk is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests; \n \u009f Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly; and \n \u009f Pension risk is the risk of increased costs from the post-employment benefit plans that we have established for our employees.  The following risk tools and processes are used to identify, manage and mitigate risks and are integral to risk management.\n \u009f We regularly monitor our risk profile across a range of risk categories. We assess the potential of these risks to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or sustainability of our business on a current and projected basis. The risks are regularly assessed through our risk appetite profile where thematic issues arise and are considered for escalation and appropriate action. This process enables us to identify current and forward-looking risks and to take action which either stops these risks materializing or limits their impact. \n \u009f In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use simulation models to help quantify the risk we are taking. The output from some of these models is included in this section of our filing. By their nature, models are based on various assumptions and relationships. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model. Consequently, model results may be considered reasonable estimates, with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections.  Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract. Day-to-day management of credit risk is administered by our Retail Chief Credit Officer with ultimate reporting responsibility to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, to the Risk Committee of the HSBC North America Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group Chief Risk Officer. Our credit and portfolio management procedures currently focus on effective collections and customer account management efforts, in addition to supporting disciplined execution of the receivable sales program. Our customer account management policies and practices are described under the caption \"Credit Quality - Customer Account Management Policies and Practices\" in this MD&A. Also see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our policies surrounding credit loss reserves. Our policies and procedures are consistent with HSBC Group standards and are regularly reviewed and updated both on an HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC level. The credit risk function continues to refine \"early warning\" indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of current experience. These risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process.\nCredit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business and risk management functions to ensure that our receivable portfolio is managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Charter is endorsed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee, and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Board of Directors will have oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews.\nCounterparty credit risk is our primary exposure on our currency swap portfolio. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of our existing currency swap derivative contracts are with HSBC Bank USA. The fair value of our agreements with\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nHSBC Bank USA required us to provide collateral to the affiliate of $317 million at December 31, 2016 and $491 million at December 31, 2015, all of which was provided in cash.\nSee Note 10, \"Derivative Financial Instruments,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to interest rate risk management and Note 18, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nLiquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of inadequate cash flow or the inability to liquidate assets or obtain funding itself. Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to fund our assets and meet commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. The primary driver of our liquidity going forward will be sales of real estate secured receivables and other balance sheet attrition. However, as we continue to execute our receivables sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. We currently do not expect third-party debt to be a source of funding for us in the future given the run-off nature of our business. Any required incremental funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plan and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or will be obtained through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has indicated it remains fully committed and has the capacity to continue to provide such support.\nHSBC North America maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan, which identifies certain potential early indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on its businesses. The liquidity contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators is monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, widening of our credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. In the event of a cash flow crisis, our objective is to fund cash requirements without HSBC affiliate access to the wholesale unsecured funding market for at least 90 days. Contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through liquidation of short term investments, sale of receivables or secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. We maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash and short-term liquid assets.\nWe project cash flow requirements and determine the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated balance sheet run-off, including liquidation of receivables held for sale, contingent liabilities and the ability of HSBC USA to access wholesale funding markets.\nPrior to 2016, we employed stressed coverage ratios to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. Stressed coverage ratios, incorporating HSBC-specific stress scenarios, were used to monitor the resilience to severe liquidity stresses. Beginning in 2016, HSBC replaced these stressed coverage ratios with the Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\"LCR\") as discussed below. As a result, we now employ this ratio as part of our approach to liquidity risk management.\nThe Basel Committee based LCR is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard beginning in 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our LCR ratio under the EU LCR rule was significantly in excess of 100 percent. A LCR ratio of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets.\nIn September 2014, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the U.S., applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR final rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that will qualify as high-quality liquid assets and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the final rule, U.S. institutions began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. The LCR final rule does not address the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nHSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America may need to make further changes to its liquidity profile to support compliance with any future final rules. HSBC Finance Corporation may need to adjust its liquidity profile to support HSBC North America's compliance with these rules, but it is not anticipated to significantly impact our operations.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") issued final standards for total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") requirements for global systemically important banks (\"G-SIBs\"), which will apply to our ultimate parent HSBC once implemented in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \"internal\" TLAC to be prepositioned (issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, to be fully phased in January 1, 2022. In the United States, the FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the U.S. in December 2016. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. intermediate holding companies of non-US G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework that may require HSBC North America to issue additional long-term debt.\nAs indicated by the major rating agencies, our credit ratings are directly dependent upon the continued support of HSBC. A credit rating downgrade would increase future borrowing costs only for new debt obligations, if any. As discussed above, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans and we expect it to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. HSBC has historically provided significant capital in support of our operations and has indicated that they remain fully committed and have the capacity to continue that support.\nThe following table summarizes our credit ratings at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\nRating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.\nIn March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nIn July 2016, Standard & Poor's Corporation (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the EU. As a result, S&P changed the rating outlook for HSBC Finance Corporation to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S&P affirmed its ratings for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nAlthough we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be changed in the future. As of December 31, 2016, there were no pending actions from these rating agencies in terms of changes to the ratings presented in the table above for HSBC Finance Corporation.\nOther conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include unforeseen capital requirements, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would require us to post additional collateral for our cross currency swaps, a slowdown in the rate of attrition of our balance sheet and an inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC and its subsidiaries.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further discussion of our liquidity position.\nMarket Risk Management The objective of our market risk management process is to manage and control market risk exposures in order to optimize return on risk. Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios. Market risk is managed by the HSBC North America Head of Market Risk.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nWe maintain an overall risk management strategy that primarily uses standard, over-the-counter cross currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps.\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps. Our financial statements are affected by movements in exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated debt.\nInterest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses due to rate movements. We use simulation models to measure the impact of anticipated changes in interest rates on net interest income and execute appropriate risk management actions. The key assumptions used in these models include projected balance sheet attrition, cash flows from a certain derivative financial instrument and changes in market conditions. While these assumptions are based on our best estimates of future conditions, we cannot precisely predict our earnings due to the uncertainty inherent in the economic environment. Historically we have used derivative financial instruments, principally standard, over-the-counter interest rate swaps, to manage these exposures.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is also changing as the balance sheet declines and a growing percentage of our remaining real estate receivables are modified and/or re-aged. Prior to the credit crisis, real estate receivables had original contractual maturities of 30 years but active customer refinancing resulted in a much shorter duration of three years. Debt was typically issued in intermediate and longer term maturities (5 to 10 years) to maximize the liquidity benefit. The interest rate risk created by combining short duration assets with long duration liabilities was reduced historically by entering into hedge positions that reduced the duration of the liabilities portfolio.\nThe duration assumption for our fixed rate real estate secured receivable portfolio is estimated to be 3.8 years at December 31, 2016 reflecting the impact of a higher percentage of receivables staying on our balance sheet longer than prior to the credit crisis due to the impact of modification programs and/or lack of refinancing alternatives. At the same time, the duration of our liability portfolio continues to decline due to the passage of time and the absence of new long-term debt issuance.\nA principal part of our management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modeling). We aim, through our management of interest rate risk, to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while weighing the cost of hedging activities on the current net revenue stream.\nNet interest income simulation modeling techniques are utilized to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various rate shock scenarios, such as scenarios in which rates rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period as well as the impact of an immediate 50 basis point decrease in the yield curve. The following table reflects the impact on projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:\n\nAs compared with December 31, 2015, the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate rise and the estimated increase in projected net interest income following a hypothetical rate reduction reflect updates of economic stress scenarios including housing price index assumptions, regular adjustments of asset and liability behavior assumptions, run-off of the balance sheet and model enhancements.\nA principal consideration underlying the projected net interest income at risk analysis is the projected prepayment of receivable balances for a given economic scenario. Individual loan underwriting standards in combination with housing valuations, receivable modification programs, changes to our foreclosure processes and macroeconomic factors related to available mortgage credit are the key assumptions driving these prepayment projections. While we have utilized a number of sources to refine these projections,\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nwe cannot currently project precise prepayment rates with a high degree of certainty in all economic environments given post crisis, significant changes in both subprime mortgage underwriting standards and property valuations across the country.\nThe projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.\nOperational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (including legal risk). Operational risk is relevant to every aspect of our business and covers a wide spectrum of risks. Our strategy is to manage operational risks in a cost effective manner, within targeted levels consistent with the risk appetite. Our Operational Risk Management Framework (\"ORMF\") ensures minimum standards of governance and organization over operational risk and internal control throughout HSBC Finance Corporation and covers all our businesses and operations (including all activities, processes and systems). During 2016, our risk profile was dominated by compliance and legal risks. The incidence of and response to regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial services firms is significant. We have prioritized resources to develop and execute remedial actions to regulatory matters, including enhancing or adding internal controls and we closely monitor the possible impacts of litigation on our operational risk profile.\nWe have established an independent operational risk management discipline in the U.S. which is led by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The mission of the Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the U.S. Head of Operational Risk and Risk Strategy, is to provide governance and strategic oversight of the ORMF, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and appetite of operational risk. Selected results and reports from this committee are communicated to the RMM and subsequently to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Management in the First LoD is responsible for managing and controlling operational risk. In addition, the central operational risk function, in conjunction with the other second line subject matter experts, provides functional oversight by coordinating the following activities:\n \u009f developing operational risk management policies and procedures; \n \u009f developing and managing methodologies and tools to support the identification, assessment, and monitoring of operational risks; \n \u009f providing firm-wide operational risk and control reporting; \n \u009f identifying emerging risks; \n \u009f analyzing root-cause of large operational risk losses; \n \u009f providing operational risk training and awareness programs for employees throughout the firm; \n \u009f communicating with the First LoD, including Business Risk and Control Managers, to ensure the ORMF is executed within their respective business or function; \n \u009f independently reviewing the operational risk and control assessments, communicating results to management and monitoring remedial actions that may be necessary to improve the assessments; and \n \u009f modeling operational risk losses and scenarios for capital management purposes.  Management of operational risk includes identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation, rectification, and reporting of the results of risk events, including losses and compliance with local regulatory requirements. These key components of the ORMF have been communicated by issuance of HSBC standards and procedures. Details and local application of the standards have been documented and communicated by issuance of a U.S. Operational Risk Policy. Key elements of the policy and our ORMF include:\n \u009f business and function management is responsible for the assessment, identification, management, and reporting of their operational risks and monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of key controls; \n \u009f material risks are assigned an overall risk prioritization / rating based on the typical and severe assessments and considers the direct financial costs and the indirect impacts to the business. An assessment of the effectiveness of key controls that mitigate these risks is made. An operational risk database is used to record the risk and control assessments and track related issues and mitigation action plans. The risk assessments are reviewed at least annually, or as business conditions change; \n \u009f key risk indicators are established and monitored where appropriate; and \n \u009f the database is also used to track operational losses for analysis of root causes, comparison with risk assessments, lessons learned and capital modeling. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \nManagement practices include standard reporting to senior management and the Operational Risk Committee of material risks, significant control deficiencies, risk mitigation action plans, losses and key risk indicators. We also monitor external operational risk events to ensure that we remain in line with best practice and take into account lessons learned from publicized operational failures within the financial services industry. Operational risk management is an integral part of the new product development and approval process and the employee performance management process, as applicable.\nInternal Audit, which is the Third LoD, provides an important independent check on controls and test institutional compliance with the ORMF. Internal Audit utilizes a risk-based approach to determine its audit coverage in order to provide an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of key controls over our operations, regulatory compliance and reporting. This includes reviews of the ORMF, the effectiveness and accuracy of the risk assessment process, and the loss data collection and reporting activities.\nCompliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, rules, codes, regulations and standards of good market practice causing us to incur fines, penalties and damage to our business and reputation. It is a composite risk that can result in regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, litigation exposure and loss of reputation. Compliance risk is inherent throughout our organization. Compliance risk is managed through a compliance risk management program made up of Regulatory Compliance (designed to comply with the spirit and letter of the laws, regulations, rules codes and standards) and Financial Crime Compliance (designed to prevent, detect and deter compliance issues, including money laundering and terrorist financing activities). Under the oversight of the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management, the Head of Regulatory Compliance and the Head of Financial Crimes Compliance oversee the design, execution and administration of our compliance risk program.\nAll HSBC employees are required to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice. In 2013, regulators and other agencies pursued investigations into historical activities and we continue to work with them in relation to already identified issues. Following the deferred prosecution agreements reached in December 2012 between U.S. authorities and HSBC and HSBC Bank USA in relation to investigations regarding inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions laws, along with a related undertaking with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, management has responded to extensive interviews and data requests and continues to enhance our controls.\nHSBC has already taken specific steps to address these issues including making significant changes to strengthen compliance, risk management and culture. These steps, which should also serve over time to enhance our compliance risk management capabilities, include the following:\n \u2022 the creation of a new global structure, which will make HSBC easier to manage and control; \n \u2022 simplifying HSBC's businesses through the ongoing implementation of an organizational effectiveness program and a five economic filters strategy; \n \u2022 implementing a sixth global risk filter which will standardize the way HSBC does business in high risk countries; \n \u2022 substantially increasing resources and significantly strengthening Compliance as a control (and not only as an advisory) function; \n \u2022 continuing to roll out cultural and values programs that define the way everyone in the HSBC Group should act; and \n \u2022 adopting and enforcing the most effective standards globally, including a globally consistent approach to knowing and retaining our customers.  Our governance framework for Compliance Risk includes two leadership roles, the U.S. Head of FCC and the U.S. Head of Regulatory Compliance, both with particular expertise and experience in U.S. laws and regulations.\nIt is clear from both our own and wider industry experience that there is a significantly increased level of activity from regulators and law enforcement agencies in pursuing investigations in relation to possible breaches of regulation and that the direct and indirect costs of such breaches can be significant. Coupled with a substantial increase in the volume of new regulation, much of which has some level of extra-territorial effect, and the geographical spread of our businesses, we believe that the level of inherent compliance risk that we face will continue to remain high for the foreseeable future.\nWithin the U.S., the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the remediation of the compliance risk management program. The Regulatory Compliance function is led by the Chief Risk Officer who reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer, and the HSBC Head of Group Risk. The U.S. Head of FCC reports directly to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer and HSBC Head of Group FCC. This reporting relationship enables the Chief Risk Officer to have direct access to HSBC Group Compliance, HSBC Group Risk and the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer as well as allowing for line of business personnel to be independent. The Chief Risk Officer has broad authority from the Board of Directors and senior\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nmanagement to develop the enterprise-wide compliance program and oversee the compliance activities across all business units, jurisdictions and legal entities. This broad authority enables the Chief Risk Officer to identify and resolve compliance issues in a timely and effective manner, and to escalate issues promptly to senior management, the Board of Directors, and HSBC as appropriate.\nWe are committed to delivering the highest quality financial products and services to our customers. Critical to our relationship with our customers is their trust in us, as fiduciary, advisor and service provider. That trust is earned not only through superior service, but also through the maintenance of the highest standards of integrity and conduct. We must, at all times, comply with high ethical standards, treat customers fairly, and comply with both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, and HSBC policies and standards. It is also our responsibility to foster good relations with regulators, recognizing and respecting their role in ensuring adherence with laws and regulations. An important element of this commitment to our customers and shareholder is our compliance risk management program, which is applied enterprise-wide.\nOur enterprise-wide program in HSBC North America is designed in accordance with HSBC policy and the principles established by the FRB in Supervision and Regulation Letter 08-8 (SR 08-8) dated October 16, 2008. By leveraging industry-leading practices and taking an enterprise-wide, integrated approach to managing our compliance risks, we can better identify and understand our compliance requirements, monitor our compliance risk profile, and assess and report our compliance performance across the organization. Consistent with the expectations of HSBC North America's regulators, our enterprise-wide compliance risk management program is designed to promote a consistent understanding of roles and responsibilities as well as consistency in compliance program activities. The program is structured to pro-actively identify as well as quickly react to emerging issues and to assess, control, measure, monitor and report compliance risks across the company, both within and across business lines, support units, jurisdictions and legal entities.\nReputational Risk Management Reputational risk is the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom we are associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves.\nReputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will vary between geographies, groups and individuals.\nHSBC tolerates a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by HSBC Group's Risk Appetite Statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, we are required to articulate and track reputational risk.\nReputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Management Board, the HSBC Group and local Board of Directors and senior management during the establishment of standards for all major aspects of business and the formulation of policy and products. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies set out operational procedures in all areas of reputational risk, including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements.\nWe have taken steps over the past several years to de-risk our remaining business to reduce reputational risk. In addition, we continue to strengthen our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken.\nThe HSBC North America RMM provides governance and oversight of reputational risk. Prior to January 2017, a monthly Risk Map process assessed the level and direction of reputational risk and helped ensure appropriate management action was taken when necessary. Beginning in January 2017, we now rely on the Risk Map assessment produced for the overall operations of HSBC North America and the stand-alone Risk Map was demised.\nStrategic Risk Management Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action. Risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and/or challenges through the strategic planning process.\nThis risk is also a function of the compatibility of an organization's strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nWe have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and the HSBC Group levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk Management Security and Fraud risk is the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, fraud, information security, incidents/disasters, cyber-attacks and groups hostile to HSBC interests. The role of Security and Fraud Risk Management (\"SFR\") is the protection of people, property, assets and information by reducing the risk to the business from terrorism, crime, incidents/disasters and groups hostile to our interests. To achieve this, SFR is organizationally part of the business it supports and they advise and assist senior executive management who have overall responsibility for security and fraud issues.\nSecurity and Fraud Risk issues are managed at the HSBC Group level by HSBC Global Security and Fraud Risk. This unit, which has responsibility for information, fraud, contingency, physical and geopolitical risks, is fully integrated within the HSBC Group Risk function. This enables management to identify and mitigate the permutations of these and other non-financial risks across the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe Information Security Risk function is responsible for ensuring that we have a progressive information protection program that is responsive to current and future threats and that we understand and manage our information risks.\nThe Fraud Risk function is responsible for ensuring that effective prevention, detection and investigation measures are in place against all forms of fraudulent activity, whether initiated internally or externally, and is available to support our business. To achieve that and to attain the level of integration needed to face the threat, the management of all types of fraud (e.g. real estate secured receivable fraud and internal fraud, including investigations), is established within one management structure and is part of the HSBC Global Risk function. We use technology extensively to prevent and detect fraud. We have developed a holistic and effective anti-fraud strategy which, in addition to the use of advanced technology, includes fraud prevention policies and practices, the implementation of strong internal controls, an investigations response team and liaison with law enforcement where appropriate.\nThe Contingency Risk function is responsible for ensuring that our critical systems, processes and functions have the resilience to maintain continuity in the face of major disruptive events. Within this wider risk, Business Continuity Management covers the pre-planning for recovery, seeking to minimize the adverse effects of major business disruption against a range of actual or emerging risks. The pre-planning concentrates on the protection of customer services, our staff, revenue generation, the integrity of data and documents and meeting regulatory requirements. Our recovery plans are developed following the completion of a Business Impact Analysis. This determines how much time we could sustain an outage before the level of losses becomes unacceptable (i.e. its criticality). These plans are reviewed and tested every year. The planning is undertaken in accordance with HSBC Group policy and standards and we confirm in an annual compliance certificate that all have been met. Should there be exceptions, these are raised and their short-term resolution is overseen by HSBC Group and HSBC North America business continuity teams. It is important that plans are dynamic and meet all risks, particularly those of an emerging nature such as possible pandemics and cyber-attacks. The ORMF is used to measure our resilience to these risks and is confirmed to HSBC Group and HSBC North America risk committees. Resilience is managed through various risk mitigation measures. These include agreeing with our information technology department about acceptable recovery times of systems, ensuring our critical buildings have the correct infrastructure to enable ongoing operations, requiring critical vendors to have their own recovery plans and arranging with HSBC Group insurance appropriate cover for business interruption costs.\nThe Physical Security Risk function develops practical physical, electronic, and operational countermeasures to ensure that the people, property and assets we manage are protected from crime, theft, attack and groups hostile to our interests.\nGeopolitical Risk provides both regular and ad hoc reporting to business executives and senior SFR management on geopolitical risk profiles and evolving threats. This both enhances strategic business planning and provides an early view into developing security risks. Security travel controls and guidance are also maintained.\nModel Risk Management Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This occurs primarily for two reasons: 1) the model may produce inaccurate outputs when compared to the intended business use and design objective; and 2) the model could be used incorrectly. In order to manage the risks arising out of the use of incorrect or misused model output or reports, a comprehensive model risk governance framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a HSBC North America Model Standards Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. Each area that uses models maintains model management procedures in accordance with the Model Standards Policy. A HSBC North America model and non-model inventory is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, a model risk measurement framework is used to measure, mitigate and monitor model risk across HSBC North America. During 2016, model risk was managed on an ongoing basis by the HSBC North America Model Oversight Committee (\"MOC\"), which was chaired by the Chief Risk Officer with broad representation from across our businesses and support functions. Based on recent regulatory guidance, in December 2016, the\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nMOC was replaced by a new Model Risk Forum, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and has a similar objective as the MOC although with a clearer focus on individual accountability in the management of model risk.\nThe Independent Model Review (\"IMR\") function, which reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for providing effective challenge of models and critical processes implemented for use within HSBC North America. Reviews are conducted in-line with supervisory guidance on model risk management issued by the OCC and FRB as well as other applicable internal and regulatory guidelines. Effective challenge is defined as a critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and produce appropriate changes. IMR's activities are separate from the model development process to ensure that incentives are aligned with the function's role to challenge models and identify model limitations, and the authority and access provided by the HSBC North America Board provides the function with the necessary influence to ensure that its recommendations are acted upon. The independent model review process assesses model development, implementation, use, validation, and governance. IMR scope covers models reported on our model inventory and critical non-model processes. Examples of models and processes that IMR reviews include: Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, Economic Capital, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, Loss Forecasting, Anti Money Laundering, Counterparty Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Risk Sensitivity and Hedging, Valuation and Fair Value Adjustment.\nPension Risk Management Pension risk is the risk of increased costs from the post-employment benefit plans that we have established for our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan. As of January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2016, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $480 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 15, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \n GLOSSARY OF TERMS \nBasis point - A unit that is commonly used to describe changes in interest rates. The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as a 1 percent change equals a 100 basis point change or .01 percent change equals 1 basis point.\nContractual Delinquency - A method of determining aging of past due accounts based on the status of payments under the receivable. An account is generally considered to be contractually delinquent when payments have not been made in accordance with the loan terms. Delinquency status may be affected by customer account management policies and practices such as the re-aging of accounts, forbearance agreements, extended payment plans, modification arrangements, external debt management plans, loan rewrites and deferments.\nCross Currency Interest Rate Swap - A contract used to minimize our exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates on foreign denominated debt.\nDelinquency Ratio - Two-months-and-over contractual delinquency expressed as a percentage of receivables held for investment and receivables held for sale at a given date.\nEffective Hedge or Qualifying Hedge - A hedging relationship which qualifies for fair value or cash flow hedge accounting treatment.\nEfficiency Ratio - Total operating expenses expressed as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and other revenues.\nFASB - Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nFDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nFirst Line of Defense or First LoD - Part of the Three Lines of Defense (\"LoD\") model for managing risk. The First LoD is predominately comprised of management who are accountable and responsible for their day to day activities, processes and controls. The First LoD must ensure all key risks within their activities and operations are identified, mitigated and monitored by an appropriate control environment that is commensurate with our risk appetite.\nForeign Exchange Contract or Currency Swap - A contract used to minimize our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFRB - The Federal Reserve Board, the principal regulator of HSBC North America.\nFVO - Fair value option.\nG-SIBs - Global systemically important banks.\nHSBC Affiliate - Any direct or indirect subsidiary of HSBC outside of our consolidated group of entities.\nInterest Rate Swap - Contract between two parties to exchange interest payments on a stated principal amount (notional principal) for a specified period. Typically, one party makes fixed rate payments, while the other party makes payments using a variable rate.\nIRS - Internal Revenue Service.\nLate Stage Delinquency - Two-months-and-over contractually delinquent receivables are classified as late stage delinquency if at any point in its life cycle it has been written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). However, as a result of account management actions or other account activity, these receivables may no longer be greater than 180 days past due.\nLCR - Liquidity Coverage Ratio.\nLiquidity - A measure of how quickly we can convert assets to cash or raise additional cash.\nNet Charge-off Ratio - Net charge-offs of receivables expressed as a percentage of average receivables outstanding for a given period.\nNet Interest Income - Interest income from receivables and investment securities reduced by interest expense.\nNet Interest Margin - Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\nNonaccrual Receivables - Receivables which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as second lien receivables (regardless of delinquency status) where the first lien receivable that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent.\nNon-qualifying hedge - A hedging relationship that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment but which may be an effective economic hedge.\nNSFR - Net stable funding ratio.\nOCC - Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n HSBC Finance Corporation \nPersonal Non-Credit Card Receivables - Unsecured lines of credit or closed-end loans made to individuals.\nReal Estate Secured Receivable - Closed-end loans and revolving lines of credit secured by first or subordinate liens on residential real estate.\nREO - Real estate owned.\nROA - Return on Average Assets - Income (loss) from continuing operations after tax as a percentage of average assets.\nROE - Return on Average Common Equity - Income (loss) from continuing operations after tax less dividends on preferred stock as a percentage of average common equity.\nSEC - The Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSecond Line of Defense or Second LoD - Part of the Three LoD model for managing risk. The Second LoD is predominately comprised of various functions, such as Finance, Legal, Risk, Compliance and Human Resources, whose role is to ensure that we are operating in line with our risk appetite. These functions must also maintain and monitor controls for which they are directly responsible.\nSecured Financing - A type of collateralized funding transaction in which the interests in a dedicated pool of real estate secured receivables are sold to a special purpose entity which then issues securities that are sold to investors. These transactions do not receive sale treatment for accounting purposes.\nTDR Loans - Troubled debt restructurings, which are substantially all receivables modified as a result of a financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modification was permanent or temporary, including all modifications with trial periods. TDR Loans also include all re-ages, except first time early stage delinquency re-ages where the customer has not been granted a prior re-age or modification. Additionally, TDR Loans include receivables discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed. TDR Loans are considered to be impaired loans.\nThird Line of Defense or Third LoD - Part of the Three LoD model for managing risk.

See Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" for additional information. \n (2) For collateral dependent receivables that are transferred to held for sale, existing credit loss reserves at the time of transfer are recognized as a charge-off. We transferred to held for sale real estate secured receivables during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and, accordingly, we recognized the existing credit loss reserves on these receivables as additional charge-off totaling $268 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $1,622 million, $58 million and $164 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 7, \"Receivables Held for Sale,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n NET INTEREST MARGIN - CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 \nThe following table shows the average balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid and the average rate by each component for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average interest earning assets from which interest income is earned. During 2016 and 2015, there was no interest expense allocated to our discontinued operations.\n\n \n (1) Rate/volume variance is allocated based on the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total interest variance. For total receivables, total interest-earning assets and total debt, the rate and volume variances are calculated based on the relative weighting of the individual components comprising these totals. These totals do not represent an arithmetic sum of the individual components. \n (2) Represents the difference between the yield earned on interest-earning assets and the cost of the debt used to fund the assets. \n HSBC Finance Corporation \n NET INTEREST MARGIN - CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2015 COMPARED WITH 2014 \nThe following table shows the average balances of the principal components of assets, liabilities and equity together with their respective interest amounts and rates earned or paid and the average rate by each component for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Form 10-K. It includes statements on forward-looking projections, risks and uncertainties, executive overviews, the economic environment, significant events of 2016, performance analyses, and critical accounting policies.\n\nForward-looking statements are made within the context of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, identifying potential future financial conditions, economic forecasts, plans, objectives, performance, business developments, and risks. It outlines market and economic conditions that may affect the company, including housing prices, unemployment, consumer confidence and spending, liquidity availability, natural disasters, cyberattacks, regulatory changes, and other factors. Details of restructuring, litigation settlements, operational changes, and asset sales are also provided.\n\nThe executive overview covers reporting structure, historic product offerings, primary funding sources, and financial statements preparation, notably emphasizing the cessation of new lending products and insurance offerings. The report touches on the economic environment, referencing slow growth of the U.S. GDP, inflation, consumer sentiment, employment, market recoveries, and legal and regulatory changes.\n\nThe 2016 events section discusses reassessments of operations, expanding receivable sales programs, litigation settlements, termination of interest rate swaps, redeeming Series B preferred stock, and impacts on financial positions.\n\nPerformance reviews indicate a net loss in 2016 primarily due to litigation liabilities and restructuring charges.
