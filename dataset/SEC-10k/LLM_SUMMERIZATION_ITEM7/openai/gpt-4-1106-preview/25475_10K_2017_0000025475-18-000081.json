MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is the world's largest publicly listed independent provider of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford Solution\u00ae offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management; workers' compensation claims and medical management; and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRD-A and CRD-B, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of the Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. U.S. Services primarily serves the U.S. property and casualty insurance company markets. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the self-insurance marketplace, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S.\nInsurance companies rely on us for certain services such as field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. Our Contractor Connection service line provides a managed contractor network to insurance carriers and consumer markets.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is highly competitive but is comprised of a limited number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, the volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks outlined in each project.\nOn January 4, 2017, the Company acquired 85% of the outstanding membership interests of WeGoLook\u00ae, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, and certain non-compete agreements, for consideration of $36,125,000 on a debt free valuation basis. WeGoLook provides a variety of on-demand inspection, verification, and other field services for businesses and consumers through a mobile platform of independent contractors.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in the Philippines. We have subsequently expanded our offshore operations to include Information Technology services performed in India. The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which will continue to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all. Costs associated with the establishment and phase-in of the Centers were $0.4 million in 2017, $3.7 million in 2016, and $4.4 million in 2015. Costs to be incurred in 2018 are not expected to be significant.\nIn 2015 we announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included restructuring and integration costs and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges, exclusive of costs related to the establishment and phase-in of the Centers, for these and other similar plans totaled $11.6 million in 2017, $5.7 million in 2016 and $30.0 million in 2015. We do not anticipate any restructuring and special charges in 2018.\nNon-cash goodwill impairment charges for 2017 were $19.6 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. Federal income tax law. The changes include, but are not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, creation of a new minimum tax on global intangible low taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), and a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d) as a result of the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) of net tax expense of $3.8 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This expense consists of provisional estimates of $7.6 million net expense for the Transition Tax, which we estimate will be fully offset by foreign tax credit carryforwards, and $3.8 million net benefit for remeasurement of our domestic deferred tax balances for the corporate rate reduction.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including GILTI, executive compensation, Transition Tax including associated foreign tax credits, and state taxes. Additionally, any changes to these provisional estimates would require us to reassess the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether GILTI taxes would be recorded as a current period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax impacts related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017. We will continue to refine these estimates in accordance with SAB 118.\nSee Note 7, \"Income Taxes\u201d of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.106 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.3% compared with $1.109 billion in 2016. Net income attributable to Crawford & Company was $27.7 million in 2017, compared with $36.0 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $12.1 million compared to $9.5 million in 2016.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services, International and Broadspire segments from 2016 to 2017. We experienced an operating earnings decline in our Garden City Group segment from 2016 to 2017.\nCompared with 2016, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements decreased 0.3% in 2017 due primarily to revenue declines in the International and Garden City Group segments, partially offset by an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services and Broadspire segments. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were also impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are now acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients related to our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million revenue reduction for the 2017 period as compared to the prior year.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings increased slightly from 2016 to 2017 due to incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the current year, partially offset by the initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nOperating earnings in our International segment increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nGarden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a decline in revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017, which negatively impacted operating earnings.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were slightly lower in 2017 than in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in professional fees and other administrative expenses, partially offset by costs associated with a branding campaign in our U.S. Services segment compared with the 2016 period.\nSegment Operating Earnings\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business, but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, establishment of new operations, and asset impairments) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of operations. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

meaningful\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased slightly from $35.6 million in 2016 to $35.7 million in 2017, representing an operating margin of 13.2% in 2017 compared with 15.4% in 2016. Operating earnings increased from 2016 to 2017 due to the incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes in the current year, partially offset by initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and costs associated with a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>31,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>69,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>188,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>71,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. WeGoLook\n</td> <td>8,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2017 compared with 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in weather-related activity resulting from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which positively impacted all of our U.S. Claims Services service lines. Revenues were also positively impacted by the acquisition of WeGoLook, representing a 3.8% positive variance in 2017 compared with 2016.\nWithin U.S. Claims Services, the increase in weather-related revenues was primarily in U.S. Catastrophe Services although U.S. Claims Field Operations and U.S. Technical Services revenues were also positively impacted by cases received from the hurricane activity. There was an increase in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of 38.7% over 2016. Excluding the impact of high-frequency, low-complexity cases received from the WeGoLook acquisition, there was an increase in segment unit volume of 9.2%. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 9.6% in 2017 compared with 2016.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $20.7 million of revenues in 2017, compared with $34.9 million in 2016. This represents a 6.1% decrease in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 1.7% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks, although the rate of growth in 2017 was lower than recent years.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $10.3 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The 2017 increase was due to the increased revenues, primarily resulting from the hurricane activity.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>159,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>10,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>40,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>210,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>210,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. WeGoLook\n</td> <td>114,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>535,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a 38.7% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2017 compared to 2016. This was primarily due to the WeGoLook acquisition, which accounted for 29.5% of the increase in U.S. Services cases. Absent the high-frequency, low-complexity cases from the WeGoLook acquisition, total cases received increased by 9.2% in 2017 compared to the 2016 period. This increase is due to an increase in weather-related case activity, primarily in our Catastrophe Services service line, as a result of cases received from hurricanes in the 2017 period. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2017 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 63.0% for 2017 and 59.0% for 2016. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes in 2017.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses increased from $136.2 million in 2016 to $169.6 million in 2017. There was an average of 1,515 FTEs (including 365 catastrophe adjusters) in 2017 compared with an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016. The increase in expenses and FTEs in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in employees related to the higher revenues, and the WeGoLook acquisition which resulted in an increase of 115 employees in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased from $59.6 million in 2016 to $64.3 million in 2017, although as a percent of segment revenues, decreased from 25.7% in 2016 to 23.9% in 2017. The increase in amount was due to the higher revenues and incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes, and a branding campaign to expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market. The decrease in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $47.2 million in 2017, an increase of 9.2% from 2016 operating earnings of $43.2 million. The operating margin increased from 9.1% in 2016 to 10.5% in 2017. The increase in operating earnings was the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>In thousands (except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Based on actual exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Based on exchange rates for year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>108,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>109,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>91,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>477,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $449.9 million in 2017, compared to $477.3 million in 2016. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $458.4 million in 2017. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 3.0% in 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were negatively impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients in our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million, or 3.4% revenue reduction, for 2017 compared to the prior year. This change had no impact on operating earnings. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.4% revenue increase for 2017 compared with 2016.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2017 compared with 2016 was due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, the change in foreign exchange rates and a reduction in weather-related activity compared with the number of cases received from flooding in that region in 2016. The change in revenues from the U.K. contractor repair business operating model was directly offset within operating expenses and had no impact on operating earnings.\nRevenues in Canada increased due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity case volumes from existing clients, and the change in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a reduction in weather-related case volumes and cases from the Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016.\nRevenues increased slightly in Asia-Pacific due to changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Asia-Pacific would have decreased slightly due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity cases, partially offset by an increase in revenues in Australia due to weather-related activity.\nThe revenue decrease in Europe and Rest of World was due to changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, partially offset by an increase in Peru due to an increase in weather-related activity and an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues decreased to $30.5 million in 2017 from $34.4 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower revenues in the 2017 period, and reduced use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada where the Fort McMurray wildfires occurred in 2016.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>114,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>173,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>84,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>289,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>661,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>682,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall case volumes were 3.0% lower in 2017 compared with 2016. The U.K. case volumes were lower in the 2017 period due primarily to flooding-related cases received in 2016. The increase in Canada cases was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in the 2017 period. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was primarily due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China. The increase in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany and an increase in weather-related activity in Peru.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, increased from 63.7% in 2016 to 65.0% in 2017. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to lower revenues. Excluding the impact of the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements would have been 62.8% in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses decreased in 2017 by $11.6 million. The decrease was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives, a reduction in employees, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. There was an average of 4,202 International FTEs in this segment in 2017, a decrease from an average of 4,236 FTEs in the 2016 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 27.2% in 2016 to 24.5% in 2017, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $19.7 million. Expenses decreased by 2.6% due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above. The decrease in amount was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives and changes in exchange rates. The decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues is primarily due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2016 and 2017.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $32.7 million in 2017, or 10.6% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017 due to higher revenues in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, operational efficiency gains, and a reduction in administrative support costs.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>161,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>15,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 2.7% to $310.1 million in 2017 compared with $302.0 million in 2016. The overall increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, as growth from new Disability clients continues. There were also increases in Medical Management revenues and Risk Management Information Services due to increased referrals in 2017.\nRevenues were positively impacted by an increase in unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which increased revenues by 8.6% from 2016 to 2017. This increase was partially offset by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which decreased revenues by approximately 5.9% in 2017. This change is primarily due to an increase in cases in the Disability service line which has lower average case values than Workers' Compensation and Liability cases.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.1 million in 2017, decreasing slightly from $4.3 million in 2016 due to a reduction in Claims Management referrals.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>174,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>132,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>167,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>474,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was an 8.6% increase in cases received in 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in Disability case referrals from new clients, and an increase Medical Management referrals, both of which are reported in the Other category above. This increase was partially offset by declines in Workers' Compensation and Casualty cases from existing clients. The reduction in Casualty cases was due to a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity affinity claims.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased slightly from 55.4% in 2016 to 55.3% in 2017. The amount of these expenses increased from $167.0 million in 2016 to $171.5 million in 2017 due to an increase in employees related to the growth in revenues. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 2,054 in 2017, up from an average of 1,995 FTEs in 2016. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues. The slight decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased slightly as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.2% in 2017 from 34.7% in 2016, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $1.0 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in rent and occupancy and other administrative expenses compared with 2016.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2017 declined compared with the 2016 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project, and a lower volume of case administration work on projects in the 2017 period. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2018, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported a 2017 operating loss of $(4.4) million, decreasing 160.5% from $7.2 million operating earnings in 2016, with the related operating margin decreasing from 7.3% in 2016 to (5.7)% in 2017. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of the winding down of the special project, lower volumes discussed above, and a reduction in employee utilization.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 22.8% to $76.2 million in 2017, compared with $98.7 million in 2016. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $66.0 million, compared to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. Of the $66.0 million backlog at December 31, 2017, approximately $40.0 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $13.0 million in 2017, decreasing from $21.3 million in 2016. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2017.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, increased to 71.2% in 2017 compared with 65.7% in 2016. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to the decline in revenues and excess capacity resulting from a decrease in employee utilization in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of related expenses declined to $54.2 million in 2017 compared with $64.8 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 467 FTEs in 2017, compared with an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, decreasing due to the lower revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 1.1% to $26.3 million in 2017 from $26.6 million in 2016, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.5% in 2017 from 27.0% in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in both fixed and variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2017.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $32.6 million in 2015 to $35.6 million in 2016, representing an operating margin of 15.4% in 2016 compared with 13.4% in 2015. Operating earnings improved 9.2% from 2015 to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>28,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>50,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>160,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>70,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a decrease in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2016 compared with 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Services, partially offset by an increase in revenues in U.S. Contractor Connection. Within U.S. Claims Services, there was a decrease in revenues in U.S. Catastrophe Services discussed below, and a decrease in revenues in our U.S. Claims Field Operations service line due to a decrease in weather-related case volumes in 2016. Revenues were positively impacted in 2016 by segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, which increased by 0.9% over 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 1.3% in 2016 compared with 2015.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $34.9 million of revenues in 2016, compared with $51.3 million in 2015. This decrease represents a 6.8% negative variance in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 19.2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2016 compared to 2015.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in both 2016 and 2015. Although there was an overall reduction in revenues, the outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>151,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>21,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>183,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>202,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>385,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was as 0.9% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2016 compared to 2015. This was due to an increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Claims Services cases. The decrease in U.S. Claim Services cases received was primarily due to a decrease in cases in U.S. Claims Field Operations resulting from decreased weather-related activity in 2016 partially offset by increases in U.S. Technical Services and U.S. Catastrophe Services resulting from new clients. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2016 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the ongoing expansion of our contractor network, the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 59.0% for 2016 and 61.8% for 2015. The decrease was due to the impact of certain cost reduction initiatives in 2015 and improved staff utilization.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses decreased from $149.9 million in 2015 to $136.2 million in 2016. There was an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016 compared with an average of 1,491 FTEs (including 454 catastrophe adjusters) in 2015. The decrease in expenses and FTEs in 2016 was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and a decline in compensation costs and personnel required to service the outsourcing project referred to above.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased from $60.2 million in 2015 to $59.6 million in 2016, although as a percent of segment revenues, increased from 24.8% in 2015 to 25.7% in 2016. The slight decrease in costs was primarily due to the impact of a reduction of office locations in the U.S. and related administrative cost reductions. The increase in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $43.2 million in 2016, an increase of 139.1% from 2015 operating earnings of $18.1 million. The operating margin increased from 3.6% in 2015 to 9.1% in 2016. The increase in operating earnings was the result of improvements in all of our major operating regions and the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>In thousands (except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Based on actual exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Based on exchange rates for year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>108,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>92,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>477,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>499,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $477.3 million in 2016, compared to $499.9 million in 2015. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $29.4 million, or approximately 5.8%, for 2016 compared with 2015. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $506.6 million in 2016. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 12.5% in 2016 compared with 2015. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 13.8% revenue increase for 2016 compared with 2015, due primarily to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases discussed below.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2016 compared with 2015 was due to the change in foreign exchange rates. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, U.K. revenues would have increased, primarily as a result of cases received from flooding in that country during the 2016 first quarter.\nRevenues in Canada increased from 2015 due primarily to an increase from the Fort McMurray wildfires, partially offset by a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases.\nRevenues increased in Asia-Pacific due to an increase in weather-related activity in Australia, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China where we have exited that product line in those countries.\nThe lower revenues in Europe and Rest of World were due to a reduction in case volumes and changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, the change in foreign exchange rates, and a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil where we have exited that product line in that country.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues increased to $34.4 million in 2016 from $28.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the increased use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada from the Fort McMurray wildfires.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>133,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>167,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>96,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>285,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>682,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>779,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall case volumes were 12.5% lower in 2016 compared with 2015. The U.K. case volumes were higher due primarily to flooding-related cases received in the 2016 first quarter, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low complexity cases. The decrease in Canada cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in 2016 which offset the increase in cases associated with the Fort McMurray wildfires. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China described above. The reduction in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was primarily due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil described above, and a reduction of cases in Scandinavia.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased from 66.9% in 2015 to 63.7% in 2016. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased in 2016 by $30.4 million. These decreases were due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015 and improved staff utilization. There was an average of 4,236 International FTEs in this segment in 2016, a decrease from 4,645 FTEs in the 2015 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nAs a component of our acquisition of GAB Robins, the Company acquired a contractor repair business where we are the principal in the relationship with clients. As the principal in this business, both revenues and the corresponding contractor costs are reported at gross values. These contractor expenses are recorded within \"Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" They are reported in this category instead of \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor,\" as the services performed by these outside contractors are not services that can be performed by our workforce.\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 29.5% in 2015 to 27.2% in 2016, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $17.4 million. The decrease in both amount and percentage is primarily due to cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $24.0 million in 2015, or 8.2% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2015 to 2016 due to higher revenues and improved control over operating expenses.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>160,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>14,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 3.1% to $302.0 million in 2016 compared with $293.0 million in 2015. The overall increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased claims and medical management revenues as well as higher average case values in 2016.\nRevenues were positively impacted by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which increased revenues by approximately 3.6% in 2016. This increase was partially offset by unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which decreased revenues by 0.5% from 2015 to 2016.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.3 million in 2016, increasing slightly from $4.2 million in 2015 due to the growth in revenues.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>178,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>154,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>103,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>436,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a 0.5% decrease in cases received in 2016 compared with 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in Medical Management case referrals, which is reported in the Other category above, partially offset by increases in workers' compensation and casualty cases resulting from new clients.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, increased to 55.4% in 2016 compared with 54.3% in 2015. The amount of these expenses increased from $159.2 million in 2015 to $167.0 million in 2016 due to the growth in revenues. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to an increase in employees and increased incentive compensation. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 1,995 in 2016, up from 1,910 FTEs in 2015. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.7% in 2016 from 37.5% in 2015, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $4.9 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in office expenses, rent and occupancy, and other administrative expenses compared with 2015.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2016 declined compared with the 2015 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2017, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported 2016 operating earnings of $7.2 million, decreasing 41.3% from $12.3 million in 2015, with the related operating margin decreasing from 9.1% in 2015 to 7.3% in 2016. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of changes in the mix of services provided and the winding down of a major gulf-related special project, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 26.8% to $98.7 million in 2016, compared with $134.8 million in 2015. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $81.0 million, the same as at December 31, 2015. Of the $81.0 million backlog at December 31, 2016, approximately $73.3 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $21.3 million in 2016, decreasing from $30.1 million in 2015. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2016.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased to 65.7% in 2016 compared with 69.0% in 2015. The decrease as a percent of revenues was due to improved employee utilization in 2016. The dollar amount of related expenses declined to $64.8 million in 2016 compared with $93.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, compared with an average of 709 FTEs in 2015, decreasing due to the decreased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 9.8% to $26.6 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 27.0% in 2016 from 21.9% in 2015. The dollar amount of these expenses decreased due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nEXPENSES AND CREDITS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS\nIncome Taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, changes in tax law, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our various domestic and international operations, which are subject to income taxes at different rates, our ability to utilize loss and tax credit carryforwards, and amounts related to uncertain income tax positions. Income tax provisions totaled $15.0 million, $25.6 million, and $13.8 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company's 2017 effective income tax rate was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. and international restructuring activities. The Company's 2015 effective income tax rate was distortive, primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, our inability to recognize tax benefits for certain international net operating losses, and fluctuations in the mix of income earned. Additionally, 2015 losses in certain operations, including losses due to restructuring and special charges, were in jurisdictions with lower tax rates or where the losses are unable to be benefited. Based on our 2018 operating plans, we anticipate our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes in 2018 to be in the 31% to 33% range before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes to U.S. tax law and policy.\nNet Corporate Interest Expense\nNet corporate interest expense consists of interest expense that we incur on our short- and long-term borrowings, partially offset by interest income we earn on available cash balances and short-term investments. These amounts vary based on interest rates, borrowings outstanding, and the amounts of invested cash. Corporate interest expense totaled $9.9 million, $9.9 million, and $9.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Corporate interest income was relatively consistent in each year, totaling $0.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We pay interest on borrowings under our Credit Facility based on variable rates. Whether we can expect to see future reductions in interest expense compared with prior periods is dependent on the future direction of interest rates as well as the level of outstanding borrowings relative to prior periods.\nStock Option Expense\nStock option expense, a component of stock-based compensation, is comprised of non-cash expenses related to stock options granted under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Stock option expense is not allocated to our operating segments. Stock option expense of $1.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million was recognized during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the 2017 period was due to a higher proportion of options having been granted in 2017 as a component of our Long Term Incentive Plans. Other stock-based compensation expense related to our Executive Stock Bonus Plan and our 2016 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (pursuant to which we have authority to grant performance shares and restricted shares) is charged to our operating segments and included in the determination of segment operating earnings or loss.\nAmortization of Customer-Relationship Intangible Assets\nAmortization of customer-relationship intangible assets represents the non-cash amortization expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled $11.0 million, $9.6 million, and $9.7 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the WeGoLook acquisition. This amortization is included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits\nCertain unallocated costs and credits are excluded from the determination of segment operating earnings. These unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent costs of our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, expenses for our chief executive officer and our Board of Directors, certain adjustments to our self-insured liabilities, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain adjustments and recoveries to our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. From time to time, we evaluate which corporate costs and credits are appropriately allocated to one or more of our operating segments. If changes are made to our allocation methodology, prior period allocations are revised to conform to our then-current allocation methodology.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits were $15.6 million, $24.0 million, and $16.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to a decrease in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, self-insured expenses, and unallocated professional fees. These costs increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to an increase in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, unallocated professional fees, and incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs and self-insured expenses.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nThe Company incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to its Garden City Group reporting unit. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nRestructuring and Special Charges\nTotal restructuring and special charges were $12.1 million for 2017, $9.5 million in 2016, and $34.4 million in 2015. See Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the restructuring and special charges.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Condition\nWe fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Company, its subsidiaries Crawford & Company Risk Services Investments Limited (the \"UK Borrower\"), Crawford & Company (Canada) Inc. (the \"Canadian Borrower\") and Crawford & Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (the \"Australian Borrower\") (the Company, together with such subsidiaries, as borrowers, the \"Borrowers\", Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender (\"Wells Fargo\"), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and a lender, Citizens Bank, N.A., as documentation agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"), which amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2011, by and among, inter alia, the Borrowers, Wells Fargo and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (as previously amended, the \"Original Credit Agreement\"). In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company, the Company's guarantor subsidiaries party thereto and Wells Fargo entered into an Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement\") and an Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement ( the \"Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement\"), each dated as of the date of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement: (i) increases the aggregate commitments under the Original Credit Agreement from $400.0 million to $450.0 million, without impacting the Company's ability, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and its receipt of additional commitments, to exercise its option to further increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $200.0 million (previously $100.0 million under the Original Credit Agreement); (ii) extends the maturity date under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to November 23, 2022 (the maturity date was November 25, 2018 under the Original Credit Agreement); (iii) reduces the interest margin ranges to 1.30% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans (previously 1.50% to 2.25%) and 0.30% to 1.10% for Base Rate loans (previously 0.50% to 1.25%); (iv) reduces the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio to 1.10 to 1.00 (previously 1.25 to 1.00); and (v) amends the leverage ratio tests to set a maximum permitted senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and set a maximum permitted total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00, among other things.\nThe credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Facility\") consists of a $450.0 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subfacility of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility contains sublimits of $185.0 million for borrowings by the UK Borrower, $75.0 million for borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, and $32.5 million for borrowings by the Australian Borrower. The Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding thereunder, will be due and payable on November 23, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Euros, the currencies of Canada, Japan, Australia or United Kingdom and, subject to the terms of the Credit Facility, other currencies. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the applicable Borrower, based on the Base Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), in each case plus an applicable interest margin based on the Company's leverage ratio (as defined below), provided that borrowings in foreign currencies may bear interest based on LIBOR only. The interest margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 1.30% to 2.10% and for Base Rate loans ranges from 0.30% to 1.10%. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent and (iii) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus 1.0%.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, a total of $224.3 million and $186.2 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition, undrawn commitments under letters of credit totaling $14.5 million and $14.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the letters of credit subfacility of the Credit Facility. These letter of credit commitments were for the Company's own obligations. Including the amounts committed under the letters of credit subfacility, the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $241.3 million and $198.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each existing material domestic subsidiary of the Company, certain other domestic subsidiaries of the Company and certain existing material foreign subsidiaries of the Company that are disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes (each such foreign subsidiary, a \"Disregarded Foreign Entity\"), and such obligations are required to be guaranteed by each subsequently acquired or formed material domestic subsidiary and Disregarded Foreign Entity (each, a \"Guarantor\"), and the obligations of the Borrowers other than the Company (\"Foreign Borrowers\") for which the Company is not the primary obligor are also guaranteed by the Company. In addition, (i) the Borrowers' obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien (subject to liens permitted by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) on substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the Guarantors as set forth in the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement and (ii) the obligations of the Foreign Borrowers are secured by a first priority lien on 100% of the capital stock of the Foreign Borrowers.\nThe representations, covenants and events of default in the Credit Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including required compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio (each as defined below).\nUnder the Credit Facility the fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\") minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nThe leverage ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated EBITDA, must not be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility. If the Company does not meet the covenant requirements in the future, it would be in default under the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the Credit Facility and ancillary documents.\nWe are not aware of any additional restrictions placed on us, or being considered to be placed on us, related to our ability to access capital, such as borrowings under the Credit Facility. We do not rely on repurchase agreements or the commercial paper market to meet our short-term or long-term funding needs. For additional information on the key covenants contained in our Credit Facility, see \"Other Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nWe continue the ongoing monitoring of our customers' ability to pay us for the services that we render to them. Based on historical results, we currently believe there is a low likelihood that write-offs of our existing accounts receivable will have a material impact on our financial results. However, if one or more of our key customers files bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to make required payments to us, or if overall economic conditions deteriorate, we may need to make material provisions in the future to increase our allowance for accounts receivable.\nThe operations of our International segment expose us to a number of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies, as well as the risk of changes in tax rates or tarriffs on earnings or services provided outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with the other functional currencies in certain of the locations in which we do business negatively impacted our revenues and operating earnings in 2017, 2016, and 2015. We cannot predict the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on our future revenues or operating earnings in our International segment.\nAt December 31, 2017, our working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $113.8 million, compared with $134.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was due to an increase in short-term borrowings largely to fund the WeGoLook acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 totaled $54.0 million, compared with $81.6 million at the end of 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily related to certain international cash balances being utilized to reduce foreign borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $17.8 million held in the U.S. and $36.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. The Company generally does not provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company's current expectation is that such earnings will be reinvested by the subsidiaries or will be repatriated only when it would be tax effective or otherwise strategically beneficial to the Company, such as if a very unusual event or project generated profits significantly in excess of ongoing business reinvestment needs. If such an event occurs, we would analyze the potential tax impact or our anticipated investment needs in that region and provide for taxes for earnings that are not expected to be permanently reinvested. Other historical earnings and future foreign earnings necessary for business reinvestment are expected to remain permanently reinvested and will be used to provide working capital for these operations, fund defined benefit pension plan obligations, repay non-U.S. debt, fund capital improvements, and fund future acquisitions. We currently believe that funds expected to be generated from our U.S. operations, along with potential borrowing capabilities in the U.S., will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operations and other obligations, including our funding obligations under our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, except in limited circumstances such as those described above, do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our U.S. operations. However, if at a future date or time these funds are necessary for our operations in the U.S. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto, or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition. No additional income or withholding taxes have been provided for any undistributed foreign earnings, other than those subject to the Transition Tax nor have any taxes been provided for outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Additionally, due to withholding tax, basis computations, and other related tax considerations, it is not practicable to estimate any taxes to be provided on outside basis differences at this time. The ultimate tax impact related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretation and assumptions, or issuance of additional guidance issued by the relevant tax authorities and we will continue to refine these estimates and our indefinite reinvestment assertion in accordance with SAB 118.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $58.1 million in 2017, from $98.9 million in 2016 to $40.8 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in accrued incentive compensation, accounts payable, and pension liabilities, and an increase in receivables and prepaid expenses. Interest payments on our debt were $8.4 million in 2017, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $15.6 million in 2017. During the 2016 period the Company settled a cross currency swap for $4.1 million increasing cash from operations for the prior year period.\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $37.2 million in 2016, from $61.7 million in 2015 to $98.9 million in 2016. This increase was largely due to higher net income and a decrease in working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest payments on our debt were $8.5 million in 2016, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $16.2 million in 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities increased by $48.9 million in 2017, from $33.0 million in 2016 to $81.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to $36.0 million for the acquisition of WeGoLook and certain non-compete agreements as discussed in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses.\" Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $44.9 million in 2017 compared with $29.2 million in 2016. This increase also includes costs incurred for the consolidation and relocation of our Atlanta Support Center as discussed in Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases.\" We forecast that our property and equipment additions in 2018, including capitalized software, will approximate $45 million due to investments required to fund initiatives in our three-year strategic plan.\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $68.2 million in 2016, from $101.2 million in 2015 to $33.0 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $68.3 million in cash payments for business acquisitions in 2015. Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $29.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.9 million in 2015.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $10.3 million in 2017. In 2017, we borrowed $94.4 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $58.5 million in short-term borrowings and $1.2 million in debt and capital lease obligations. The increase in borrowings in the 2017 period was primarily due to borrowings to fund the WeGoLook acquisition and increased working capital requirements. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.7 million. Also in 2017, we repurchased shares of CRD-A and CRD-B stock totaling $7.4 million, and we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.9 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nCash used by financing activities was $55.2 million in 2016. We borrowed $80.2 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $118.0 million in short-term borrowings and $1.5 million in debt and capital lease obligations. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.6 million. Also in 2016, we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.3 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nOther Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term debt obligations typically peak during the first quarter of each year due to the payment of incentive compensation awards, contributions to retirement plans, and certain other recurring payments, and generally decline during the balance of the year. Our maximum month-end short-term debt obligations were $32.0 million and $23.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our average month-end short-term debt obligations were $8.3 million and $13.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings, excluding outstanding but undrawn letters of credit under our Credit Facility, was $24.6 million and $30 thousand at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The balance in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017 represents amounts under our revolving Credit Facility that we expect, but are not required, to repay in the next twelve months. We have historically used the proceeds from our long-term borrowings to finance, among other things, business acquisitions.\nAs described above, we have two principal financial covenants in our Credit Facility. The leverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio, defined in our Credit Facility as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\"). This ratio must not exceed 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated EBITDA minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all required ratios under our Credit Facility. Based on our financial plans, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with all required covenants throughout 2018. Our compliance with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in our EBITDA, and if our financial plans for 2018 or other future periods do not meet our current projections, we could fail to remain in compliance with these financial covenants in our Credit Facility.\nOur compliance with the leverage ratio covenant is also sensitive to changes in our level of consolidated total funded debt, as defined in our Credit Facility. In addition to short- and long-term borrowings, capital leases, and bank overdrafts, among other things, consolidated total funded debt includes letters of credit, the need for which can fluctuate based on our business requirements. An increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility could negatively impact our leverage ratio, unless those increased borrowings are offset by a corresponding increase in our EBITDA. In addition, a reduction in EBITDA in the future could limit our ability to utilize available credit under the Credit Facility, which could negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nOur compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, which measures our ability to pay certain recurring expenses such as interest and lease payments, is also sensitive to the level of capital expenditures and restricted payments, as defined in our Credit Facility. A decrease in EBITDA could negatively impact our fixed charge coverage ratio, as could increases in our capital expenditures, interest expense, tax expense or restricted payments. If we do not manage those items carefully, we could be in default under the Credit Agreement, which would negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nWe believe our current financial resources, together with funds generated from operations and existing and potential borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to maintain our current operations for the next 12 months.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the impact that our contractual obligations, including estimated interest payments, are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:\n(Note references in the following table refer to the note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (Note 6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portions (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>24,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total, before interest payments\n</td> <td>64,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments under Credit Facility\n</td> <td>10,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Assumes principal amounts are repaid at maturity and not refinanced.\nApproximately $17.2 million of operating lease obligations included in the table above are expected to be funded by sublessors under existing sublease agreements. See Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate, based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, in either case plus an applicable margin. Long-term debt refers to the required principal repayment at maturity of the Credit Facility, and may differ significantly from estimates, due to, among other things, actual amounts outstanding at maturity or any refinancings prior to such date. Interest amounts are based on projected borrowings under our Credit Facility and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2017, and the actual interest payments may differ significantly from estimates due to, among other things, changes in outstanding borrowings and prevailing interest rates in the future.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $11.3 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We expect $6.2 million in reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.\nGross deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $51.1 million. This amount is not included in the contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, we believe scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\nDefined Benefit Pension Funding and Cost\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., (the \"U.S. Qualified Plan\") three defined benefit plans in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Plans\"), and defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the Philippines (the \"other international plans\"). Future cash funding of our defined benefit pension plans will depend largely on future investment performance, interest rates, changes to mortality tables, and regulatory requirements. Effective December 31, 2002, we froze our U.S. Qualified Plan. The aggregate deficit in the funded status of the U.S. Plan and other international plans totaled $87.0 million and $105.2 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 decrease in the unfunded deficit of our defined benefit pension plans primarily resulted from the return on plan assets, contributions and adoption of updated mortality tables used to determine U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities. During 2017, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.6 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. In 2016, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.1 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. The U.K. Plans were in a funded status totaling $34.7 million and $21.6 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the projected benefit obligation. There was a $13.1 million increase during 2017 in the net prepaid pension balances of the U.K. defined benefit plan that is in an overfunded position.\nOur frozen U.S. Qualified Plan was underfunded by $85.8 million at December 31, 2017 based on an accumulated benefit obligation of $474.6 million. Crawford expects to make discretionary contributions of $9.0 million per annum to the U.S. Qualified Plan for the next five fiscal years to improve the funded status of the plan and minimize future required contributions. We estimate that we will make the following annual minimum contributions over the next five years to our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.K. Plans:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>Estimated U.S. Pension Funding\n</td> <td>Estimated U.K. Pension Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunding requirements are no longer as sensitive to changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the U.S. Qualified plan. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\"BBA2015\") included pension funding reform which greatly reduced the contributions required to the U.S. Qualified Plan. In addition to BBA2015 legislation, pension funding has been governed by rules under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended by the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, and the Highway Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Volatility in the capital markets and future legislation may have a negative impact on our U.S., U.K. and other international pension plans, which may further increase the underfunded portion of our pension plans and our attendant funding obligations. Expected and required contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans will reduce our liquidity, restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to deploy capital to other opportunities.\nCommercial Commitments\nAs a component of our Credit Facility, we maintain a letter of credit facility to satisfy certain contractual obligations. At December 31, 2017, the issued, but undrawn, letters of credit totaled approximately $14.5 million. These letters of credit are typically renewed annually, but unless renewed, will expire as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, which could materially impact our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have certain material obligations under operating lease agreements to which we are a party. In accordance with GAAP, these operating lease obligations and the related leased assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe maintain funds in trusts to administer claims for certain clients. These funds are not available for our general operating activities and, as such, have not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have concluded that we do not have material off-balance sheet financial risk related to these funds at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nThe following addresses changes in our financial condition not addressed elsewhere in this MD&A.\nSignificant changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, compared with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, were as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accounts receivable increased by $20.6 million, or $14.8 million excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange impacts and other adjustments, in 2017 compared with 2016.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under then-existing circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes in these underlying estimates could potentially materially affect consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of change. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the amounts provided for are based on the best information available to us and we believe these estimates are reasonable.\nWe have discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this MD&A.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of claims processing or program administration fees. Fees for professional services are recognized as unbilled revenues at estimated collectible amounts at the time such services are rendered. Substantially all unbilled revenues are billed within one year. Out-of-pocket costs incurred in administering a claim are typically passed on to our clients and included in our revenues under GAAP. Deferred revenues represent the estimated unearned portion of fees related to future services to be performed under certain fixed-fee service arrangements. Deferred revenues are recognized into revenues based on the estimated rate at which the services are provided. These rates are primarily based on an evaluation of historical claim closing rates by major claim type. Additionally, recent claim closing rates are evaluated to ensure that current claim closing history does not indicate a significant deterioration or improvement in the longer-term historical closing rates used.\nOur fixed-fee service arrangements typically require us to handle claims on either a one- or two-year basis, or for the lifetime of the claim. In cases where we handle a claim on a non-lifetime basis, we typically receive an additional fee on each anniversary date that the claim remains open. For service arrangements where we provide services for the life of the claim, we are only paid one fee for the life of the claim, regardless of the duration of the claim. As a result, our deferred revenues for claims handled for one or two years are not as sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since the revenues are recognized in the near future, and additional fees are generated for handling long-lived claims. Deferred revenues for lifetime claim handling are considered more sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since we are obligated to handle these claims to their conclusion with no additional fees received for long-lived claims. For all fixed fee service arrangements, revenues are recognized over the expected service periods, by type of claim.\nBased upon our historical averages, we close approximately 98% of all cases referred to us under lifetime claim service arrangements within five years from the date of referral. Also, within that five-year period, the percentage of cases remaining open in any one particular year has remained relatively consistent from period to period. Each quarter we evaluate our historical case closing rates by type of claim and make adjustments as necessary. Any changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined.\nAs of December 31, 2017, deferred revenues related to lifetime claim handling arrangements approximated $41.8 million. If the rate at which we close cases changes, the amount of revenues recognized within a period could be affected. In addition, given the competitive environment in which we operate, we may be unable to raise our prices to offset the additional expense associated with handling longer-lived claims should such case closing rates change. The change in our first-year case closing rates over the last ten years has ranged from a decrease of 3.6% to an increase of 4.8%, and has averaged an increase of 0.2%. A 1.0% change is a reasonably likely change in our estimate based on historical data. Absent an increase in per-claim fees from our clients, a 1.0% decrease in claim closing rates for lifetime claims would have resulted in the deferral of additional revenues of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. If our average claim closing rates for lifetime claims increased by 1.0%, we would have recognized additional revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company has contracts with multi-element arrangements. The Company often sells multiple lines of claims processing and different levels of processing depending on the complexity of the claims within a contract. The Company typically provides a menu of offerings from which the customer chooses to purchase or not at their discretion. The price of each service is separate and distinct and provides a separate and distinct value to the customer. Pricing is consistent for each service irrespective of the other service(s) or quantities requested by the customer. For example, if we provide claims processing for auto and general liability, those services are priced and delivered independently.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments and for adjustments to invoiced amounts. Losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments are accounted for as bad debt expense, while adjustments to invoices are accounted for as reductions to revenues. These allowances are established by using historical write-off or adjustment information intended to determine future loss expectations and by considering the current credit worthiness of our clients, any known specific collection problems, and our assessment of current industry conditions. Actual experience may differ significantly from historical or expected loss results. Each quarter, we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in determining these allowances and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $12.6 million and $14.5 million, or approximately 6.7% and 8.6% of gross billed receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to us, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed to be appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 1.0% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other long-lived assets have been impaired. Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets (tangible and intangible) acquired in certain business combinations. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names associated with acquired businesses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing at least annually. When factors indicate that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment between the scheduled annual impairment tests, we perform an interim impairment test. Our other long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, deferred income tax assets, capitalized software, and amortizable intangible assets related to customer relationships, technology, and trade names with finite lives. Other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are identified.\nWe currently have five reporting units for goodwill impairment purposes. These reporting units are our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations, our U.S. Contractor Connection operations on a stand-alone basis, and our other operating segments - International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group.\nIn the annual impairment analysis of goodwill, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair values of those reporting units as determined by a combination of the income approach, specifically discounting future projected cash flows, and the market approach, specifically the Guideline Public Company Method, as described in more detail in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We perform an interim impairment analysis of goodwill when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are based upon certain assumptions made by us. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are reconciled to the Company's total market value as determined by its stock price in order to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed on a reporting unit basis. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The loss recognized cannot subsequently be reversed.\nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the quantitative analysis described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If we conclude that this is the case, we perform the quantitative analysis discussed above.\nThe estimated fair value of our U.S. Contractor Connection operations, International, and Broadspire reporting units exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. The estimated fair value of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit exceeds its carrying value but not by as much of a margin. The U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit has $19.4 million of goodwill at risk of potential future impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 125 basis points could potentially trigger an impairment of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit goodwill, assuming no change in the other key inputs. The Company recognized goodwill impairment charges for the entire goodwill allocated to its Garden City Group reporting unit of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017 due to the reporting unit achieving less than forecasted revenue and operating earnings and based on future expected operating results. We intend to continue to monitor the performance of our reporting units for potential indicators of impairment. If impairment indicators exist, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units utilizing the income approach include the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The discount rates utilized in estimating the fair value of our reporting units in 2017 range between 10.0% and 13.5%, reflecting our assessment of a market participant's view of the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The terminal growth rate used in the analysis was 2.0%. The assumptions used in estimating the fair values are based on currently available data and management's best estimates of revenues and cash flows and, accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names, with carrying values of $29.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, are also evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of potential impairment are identified. Based on our 2017 analysis, we do not believe these trade names are impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test involves estimating the fair value using an internally prepared discounted cash flow analysis. The fair values of the Company's trade names are established using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This method recognizes that, by virtue of owning the trade name as opposed to licensing it, a company or reporting unit is relieved from paying a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of net sales, for the asset's use. The present value of the after-tax costs savings (i.e., royalty relief) at an appropriate discount rate including a tax amortization benefit indicates the value of the trade name. We determined the discount rate based on our performance compared to similar market participants, factored by risk in forecasting using a modified capital asset pricing model.\nThe values of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names are each sensitive to changes in the assumptions used above. The estimated fair value of our Broadspire and SLS trade names exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. An increase in the discount rate by 2.5% could potentially trigger an impairment of the WeGoLook trade name, assuming no changes in the other key inputs. We will continue to monitor the value of these trade names for potential indicators of impairment.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. that cover a substantial number of current and former employees in each location. Certain other employees located in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Philippines have retirement benefits that are accounted for as defined benefit pension plans under GAAP. We utilize the services of independent actuaries to help us estimate our pension obligations and measure pension costs. Our U.S. Qualified Plan was frozen on December 31, 2002. Our U.K. Plans were closed to new employees as of October 31, 1997, but existing participants may still accrue additional limited benefits based on salary levels existing at the close date. Benefits payable under our U.S. Qualified Plan are generally based on career compensation; however, no additional benefits accrue on our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan after December 31, 2002. Benefits payable under the U.K. Plans are generally based on an employee's salary at the time the applicable plan was closed. Our funding policy is to make cash contributions in amounts sufficient to maintain the plans on an actuarially sound basis, but not in excess of amounts deductible under applicable income tax regulations. Note 8, \"Retirement Plans,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides details about the assumptions used in determining the funded status of the plans, the unrecognized actuarial gain/(loss), the components of net periodic benefit cost, benefit payments expected to be made in the future and plan asset allocations.\nInvestment objectives for the Company's U.S. and U.K. pension plan assets are to:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ensure availability of funds for payment of plan benefits as they become due;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to volatility, and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>provide investment results that meet or exceed the plans' actuarially assumed long-term rate of return.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term goal for the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans is to reach fully-funded status and to maintain that status. The investment policies contemplate the plans' asset return requirements and risk tolerances changing over time. Accordingly, reallocation of the portfolios' mix of return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets will be performed as the plans' funded status improves. In conjunction with our investment policies we have rebalanced the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans' target allocation mix from an equity-weighted to a fixed-income weighted investment strategy, as we have made cash contributions to the plan and the plans' funded status has improved.\nThe rules for pension accounting are complex and the assumptions used can produce volatility in our results, financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the measurement date). Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which are subject to volatility.\nIn addition to expense volatility, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension plans. These adjustments have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and, like our pension expense, are a result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at each measurement date, as well as periodic changes to mortality tables used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. The funded status of our plans may also impact our liquidity, as changes to funding laws in the U.S. may require higher funding levels for our pension plans.\nThe principal assumptions used in accounting for our defined benefit pension plans are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, and the mortality expectations for plan participants. The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Our discount rates were determined with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. At December 31, 2017, the discount rate used to compute the benefit obligations of the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans were 3.63% and 2.61%, respectively.\nThe estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in collective funds. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities as described above.\nEstablishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. As a result of the transition to a liability-driven investment strategy described previously, the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption used to determine 2018 net periodic pension cost were estimated to be 6.20% and 3.85% for the U.S. and U.K. plans, respectively.\nWe review our employee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary. During 2017, we revised the mortality assumptions for the U.S. plans to incorporate the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect Company-specific experience and future expectations. This resulted in a $3.2 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. plans.\nPension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the calculated value method. The amounts recognized in the balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date and the effect of mark-to-market accounting on plan assets. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an increase to equity through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") of $0.7 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2017. At December 31, 2016, we recorded an increase to equity through OCI of $11.3 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2016. Those changes are subject to amortization over future years and may be reflected in future income statements.\nCumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for all plans were $268.5 million through December 31, 2017, compared with $280.0 million through December 31, 2016. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the discount rates, differences between expected and actual asset returns, and changes to mortality expectations for plan participants, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless the minimum amount required to be amortized is below a corridor amount equal to 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future periods. For example, projected pension plan expense for 2018 includes $10.3 million of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $11.2 million in 2017, $12.8 million in 2016 and $13.4 million in 2015.\nNet periodic pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions for the expected rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans. If our assumptions for the expected returns on plan assets of our U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans changed by 0.5%, representing either an increase or decrease in expected returns, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $3.3 million. If our assumptions for the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans changed by 0.25%, representing either an increase or decrease in interest rates used to value pension plan liabilities, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $0.8 million.\nBeginning with the December 31, 2016 measurement, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for U.S. and international pension and other postretirement benefits. This new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. Historically, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.\nWe made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. While the benefit obligation measured under this approach is unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates reduced the service and interest cost for the pension plans for fiscal 2017 by $3.2 million. We do not expect this change will have a material effect in periods beyond 2017. For the pension plans, the weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs were 3.23% for the Company's U.S. plans and 2.66% for the U.K. plans.\nDetermination of Effective Tax Rate Used for Financial Reporting\nWe account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred taxes are made in recognition of these temporary differences. The most significant differences relate to revenue recognition, accrued compensation and pensions, self-insurance, and depreciation and amortization.\nFor financial reporting purposes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to our income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our consolidated balance sheets that are not related to balances in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon changes between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for income tax purposes, multiplied by the enacted statutory tax rates for the year in which we estimate these differences will reverse. We must estimate the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, as well as whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nOther factors which influence our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes include changes in enacted statutory tax rates, changes in tax law or policy, changes in the composition of taxable income from the countries in which we operate, our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nOur effective tax rate, defined as our provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, for financial reporting purposes in 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)%, respectively. If our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes changed by 1.0%, we would have recognized an increase or decrease to income taxes of approximately $421,000, $635,000, and $316,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes is expected to range between 31% and 33% in 2018 before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes in tax law or policy.\nIt is possible that future changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate, including but not limited to changes in tax law or policy, could have a significant impact on U.S.-based multinational companies such as our Company. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood or details of any such changes or their specific potential impact on our Company.\nOur most significant deferred tax assets are related to the unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans, tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards. The tax deduction for defined benefit pension plans generally occurs upon funding of plan liabilities. Assuming that the estimated minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and the income projections are met, the deferred tax asset should be realized.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we have considered the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards and have an $18.8 million valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in our international and domestic operations. For our remaining deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets based on our forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that are available to the Company. Future changes in the valuation allowance, if required, should not affect our liquidity or our compliance with any existing debt covenants.\nOur tax credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded a valuation allowance primarily consist of $22.0 million of foreign tax credit (\"FTC\") carryforwards, which materially expire in 2020. Companies that cannot credit all the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid in a particular tax year because their foreign taxes exceed their FTC limitation are allowed to carry their excess taxes back to the preceding tax year and then forward to the ten succeeding years. Utilization of our FTCs is dependent upon sufficient U.S. regular taxable income and foreign source income in the relevant foreign tax credit basket which is impacted by the interaction of overall domestic and overall foreign loss rules. Based on our projections of income through 2020, including the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., we expect to fully utilize the FTC carryforwards before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the FTC carryforwards will be utilized.\nThe NOL carryforwards for which a valuation allowance is not recorded primarily consists of $11.4 million of U.K. NOL carryforwards and $8.0 million of state NOL carryforwards generated by our domestic companies.\nIn the U.K., NOL carryforwards have an unlimited life. Based on our evaluation of sources of taxable income, we expect to fully utilize the U.K. NOL carryforwards. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we should be able to utilize our U.K. NOL carryforwards.\nIn order to fully utilize these state NOL carryforwards, our domestic operations must generate taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards. Based on our projections of income, the Company expects to fully utilize its state NOL carryforwards in the majority of jurisdictions before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards for these jurisdictions. There are certain states with unique rules that result in the Company not expecting to utilize the state NOL carryforwards before expiration. For those jurisdictions, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards and a valuation allowance was recorded. The valuation allowance against state NOL carryforwards was $0.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe remaining NOL carryforwards were generated by certain foreign jurisdictions and are generally offset by full valuation allowances.\nSelf-Insured Risks\nWe self-insure certain insurable risks consisting primarily of professional liability, auto liability, employee medical, disability, and workers' compensation. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures, including professional liability on a claims-made basis, and those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Most of these self-insured risks are in the U.S. Provisions for claims incurred under self-insured programs are made based on our estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred, including estimated legal fees, losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us, and the adverse developments on reported losses. These estimated liabilities are calculated based on historical claim payment experience, the expected life of the claims, and other factors considered relevant to the claims. The liabilities for claims incurred under our self-insured workers' compensation and employee disability programs are discounted at the prevailing risk-free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration. All other self-insured liabilities are undiscounted. Each quarter we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in developing these estimated liabilities and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our estimated liabilities for self-insured risks totaled $22.9 million and $26.3 million, respectively. The estimated liability is most sensitive to changes in the ultimate liability for a claim and, if applicable, the interest rate used to discount the liability. We believe our provisions for self-insured losses are adequate to cover the expected cost of losses incurred, net of insurance recoveries. However, these provisions are estimates and amounts ultimately settled may be significantly greater or less than the provisions established. We used a discount rate of 2.05% to determine the present value of our self-insured workers' compensation liabilities as of December 31, 2017. If the average discount rate was reduced by 1.0% or increased by 1.0%, reflecting either an increase or decrease in underlying interest rates, our estimated liabilities for these self-insured risks at December 31, 2017 would have been impacted by approximately $529,000, resulting in an increase or decrease to 2017 consolidated net income of approximately $329,000.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is the world's largest publicly listed independent provider of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford Solution\u00ae offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management; workers' compensation claims and medical management; and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRD-A and CRD-B, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of the Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. U.S. Services primarily serves the U.S. property and casualty insurance company markets. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the self-insurance marketplace, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S.\nInsurance companies rely on us for certain services such as field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. Our Contractor Connection service line provides a managed contractor network to insurance carriers and consumer markets.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is highly competitive but is comprised of a limited number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, the volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks outlined in each project.\nOn January 4, 2017, the Company acquired 85% of the outstanding membership interests of WeGoLook\u00ae, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, and certain non-compete agreements, for consideration of $36,125,000 on a debt free valuation basis. WeGoLook provides a variety of on-demand inspection, verification, and other field services for businesses and consumers through a mobile platform of independent contractors.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in the Philippines. We have subsequently expanded our offshore operations to include Information Technology services performed in India. The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which will continue to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all. Costs associated with the establishment and phase-in of the Centers were $0.4 million in 2017, $3.7 million in 2016, and $4.4 million in 2015. Costs to be incurred in 2018 are not expected to be significant.\nIn 2015 we announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included restructuring and integration costs and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges, exclusive of costs related to the establishment and phase-in of the Centers, for these and other similar plans totaled $11.6 million in 2017, $5.7 million in 2016 and $30.0 million in 2015. We do not anticipate any restructuring and special charges in 2018.\nNon-cash goodwill impairment charges for 2017 were $19.6 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. Federal income tax law. The changes include, but are not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, creation of a new minimum tax on global intangible low taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), and a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d) as a result of the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) of net tax expense of $3.8 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This expense consists of provisional estimates of $7.6 million net expense for the Transition Tax, which we estimate will be fully offset by foreign tax credit carryforwards, and $3.8 million net benefit for remeasurement of our domestic deferred tax balances for the corporate rate reduction.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including GILTI, executive compensation, Transition Tax including associated foreign tax credits, and state taxes. Additionally, any changes to these provisional estimates would require us to reassess the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether GILTI taxes would be recorded as a current period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax impacts related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017. We will continue to refine these estimates in accordance with SAB 118.\nSee Note 7, \"Income Taxes\u201d of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.106 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.3% compared with $1.109 billion in 2016. Net income attributable to Crawford & Company was $27.7 million in 2017, compared with $36.0 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $12.1 million compared to $9.5 million in 2016.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services, International and Broadspire segments from 2016 to 2017. We experienced an operating earnings decline in our Garden City Group segment from 2016 to 2017.\nCompared with 2016, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements decreased 0.3% in 2017 due primarily to revenue declines in the International and Garden City Group segments, partially offset by an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services and Broadspire segments. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were also impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are now acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients related to our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million revenue reduction for the 2017 period as compared to the prior year.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings increased slightly from 2016 to 2017 due to incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the current year, partially offset by the initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nOperating earnings in our International segment increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nGarden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a decline in revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017, which negatively impacted operating earnings.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were slightly lower in 2017 than in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in professional fees and other administrative expenses, partially offset by costs associated with a branding campaign in our U.S. Services segment compared with the 2016 period.\nSegment Operating Earnings\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business, but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, establishment of new operations, and asset impairments) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of operations. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

meaningful\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased slightly from $35.6 million in 2016 to $35.7 million in 2017, representing an operating margin of 13.2% in 2017 compared with 15.4% in 2016. Operating earnings increased from 2016 to 2017 due to the incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes in the current year, partially offset by initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and costs associated with a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>31,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>69,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>188,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>71,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. WeGoLook\n</td> <td>8,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2017 compared with 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in weather-related activity resulting from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which positively impacted all of our U.S. Claims Services service lines. Revenues were also positively impacted by the acquisition of WeGoLook, representing a 3.8% positive variance in 2017 compared with 2016.\nWithin U.S. Claims Services, the increase in weather-related revenues was primarily in U.S. Catastrophe Services although U.S. Claims Field Operations and U.S. Technical Services revenues were also positively impacted by cases received from the hurricane activity. There was an increase in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of 38.7% over 2016. Excluding the impact of high-frequency, low-complexity cases received from the WeGoLook acquisition, there was an increase in segment unit volume of 9.2%. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 9.6% in 2017 compared with 2016.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $20.7 million of revenues in 2017, compared with $34.9 million in 2016. This represents a 6.1% decrease in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 1.7% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks, although the rate of growth in 2017 was lower than recent years.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $10.3 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The 2017 increase was due to the increased revenues, primarily resulting from the hurricane activity.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>159,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>10,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>40,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>210,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>210,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. WeGoLook\n</td> <td>114,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>535,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a 38.7% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2017 compared to 2016. This was primarily due to the WeGoLook acquisition, which accounted for 29.5% of the increase in U.S. Services cases. Absent the high-frequency, low-complexity cases from the WeGoLook acquisition, total cases received increased by 9.2% in 2017 compared to the 2016 period. This increase is due to an increase in weather-related case activity, primarily in our Catastrophe Services service line, as a result of cases received from hurricanes in the 2017 period. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2017 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 63.0% for 2017 and 59.0% for 2016. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes in 2017.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses increased from $136.2 million in 2016 to $169.6 million in 2017. There was an average of 1,515 FTEs (including 365 catastrophe adjusters) in 2017 compared with an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016. The increase in expenses and FTEs in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in employees related to the higher revenues, and the WeGoLook acquisition which resulted in an increase of 115 employees in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased from $59.6 million in 2016 to $64.3 million in 2017, although as a percent of segment revenues, decreased from 25.7% in 2016 to 23.9% in 2017. The increase in amount was due to the higher revenues and incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes, and a branding campaign to expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market. The decrease in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $47.2 million in 2017, an increase of 9.2% from 2016 operating earnings of $43.2 million. The operating margin increased from 9.1% in 2016 to 10.5% in 2017. The increase in operating earnings was the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>In thousands (except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Based on actual exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Based on exchange rates for year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>108,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>109,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>91,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>477,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $449.9 million in 2017, compared to $477.3 million in 2016. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $458.4 million in 2017. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 3.0% in 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were negatively impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients in our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million, or 3.4% revenue reduction, for 2017 compared to the prior year. This change had no impact on operating earnings. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.4% revenue increase for 2017 compared with 2016.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2017 compared with 2016 was due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, the change in foreign exchange rates and a reduction in weather-related activity compared with the number of cases received from flooding in that region in 2016. The change in revenues from the U.K. contractor repair business operating model was directly offset within operating expenses and had no impact on operating earnings.\nRevenues in Canada increased due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity case volumes from existing clients, and the change in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a reduction in weather-related case volumes and cases from the Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016.\nRevenues increased slightly in Asia-Pacific due to changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Asia-Pacific would have decreased slightly due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity cases, partially offset by an increase in revenues in Australia due to weather-related activity.\nThe revenue decrease in Europe and Rest of World was due to changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, partially offset by an increase in Peru due to an increase in weather-related activity and an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues decreased to $30.5 million in 2017 from $34.4 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower revenues in the 2017 period, and reduced use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada where the Fort McMurray wildfires occurred in 2016.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>114,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>173,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>84,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>289,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>661,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>682,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall case volumes were 3.0% lower in 2017 compared with 2016. The U.K. case volumes were lower in the 2017 period due primarily to flooding-related cases received in 2016. The increase in Canada cases was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in the 2017 period. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was primarily due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China. The increase in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany and an increase in weather-related activity in Peru.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, increased from 63.7% in 2016 to 65.0% in 2017. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to lower revenues. Excluding the impact of the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements would have been 62.8% in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses decreased in 2017 by $11.6 million. The decrease was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives, a reduction in employees, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. There was an average of 4,202 International FTEs in this segment in 2017, a decrease from an average of 4,236 FTEs in the 2016 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 27.2% in 2016 to 24.5% in 2017, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $19.7 million. Expenses decreased by 2.6% due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above. The decrease in amount was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives and changes in exchange rates. The decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues is primarily due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2016 and 2017.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $32.7 million in 2017, or 10.6% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017 due to higher revenues in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, operational efficiency gains, and a reduction in administrative support costs.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>161,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>15,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 2.7% to $310.1 million in 2017 compared with $302.0 million in 2016. The overall increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, as growth from new Disability clients continues. There were also increases in Medical Management revenues and Risk Management Information Services due to increased referrals in 2017.\nRevenues were positively impacted by an increase in unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which increased revenues by 8.6% from 2016 to 2017. This increase was partially offset by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which decreased revenues by approximately 5.9% in 2017. This change is primarily due to an increase in cases in the Disability service line which has lower average case values than Workers' Compensation and Liability cases.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.1 million in 2017, decreasing slightly from $4.3 million in 2016 due to a reduction in Claims Management referrals.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>174,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>132,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>167,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>474,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was an 8.6% increase in cases received in 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in Disability case referrals from new clients, and an increase Medical Management referrals, both of which are reported in the Other category above. This increase was partially offset by declines in Workers' Compensation and Casualty cases from existing clients. The reduction in Casualty cases was due to a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity affinity claims.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased slightly from 55.4% in 2016 to 55.3% in 2017. The amount of these expenses increased from $167.0 million in 2016 to $171.5 million in 2017 due to an increase in employees related to the growth in revenues. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 2,054 in 2017, up from an average of 1,995 FTEs in 2016. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues. The slight decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased slightly as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.2% in 2017 from 34.7% in 2016, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $1.0 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in rent and occupancy and other administrative expenses compared with 2016.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2017 declined compared with the 2016 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project, and a lower volume of case administration work on projects in the 2017 period. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2018, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported a 2017 operating loss of $(4.4) million, decreasing 160.5% from $7.2 million operating earnings in 2016, with the related operating margin decreasing from 7.3% in 2016 to (5.7)% in 2017. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of the winding down of the special project, lower volumes discussed above, and a reduction in employee utilization.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 22.8% to $76.2 million in 2017, compared with $98.7 million in 2016. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $66.0 million, compared to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. Of the $66.0 million backlog at December 31, 2017, approximately $40.0 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $13.0 million in 2017, decreasing from $21.3 million in 2016. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2017.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, increased to 71.2% in 2017 compared with 65.7% in 2016. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to the decline in revenues and excess capacity resulting from a decrease in employee utilization in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of related expenses declined to $54.2 million in 2017 compared with $64.8 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 467 FTEs in 2017, compared with an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, decreasing due to the lower revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 1.1% to $26.3 million in 2017 from $26.6 million in 2016, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.5% in 2017 from 27.0% in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in both fixed and variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2017.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $32.6 million in 2015 to $35.6 million in 2016, representing an operating margin of 15.4% in 2016 compared with 13.4% in 2015. Operating earnings improved 9.2% from 2015 to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>28,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>50,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>160,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>70,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a decrease in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2016 compared with 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Services, partially offset by an increase in revenues in U.S. Contractor Connection. Within U.S. Claims Services, there was a decrease in revenues in U.S. Catastrophe Services discussed below, and a decrease in revenues in our U.S. Claims Field Operations service line due to a decrease in weather-related case volumes in 2016. Revenues were positively impacted in 2016 by segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, which increased by 0.9% over 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 1.3% in 2016 compared with 2015.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $34.9 million of revenues in 2016, compared with $51.3 million in 2015. This decrease represents a 6.8% negative variance in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 19.2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2016 compared to 2015.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in both 2016 and 2015. Although there was an overall reduction in revenues, the outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>151,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>21,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>183,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>202,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>385,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was as 0.9% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2016 compared to 2015. This was due to an increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Claims Services cases. The decrease in U.S. Claim Services cases received was primarily due to a decrease in cases in U.S. Claims Field Operations resulting from decreased weather-related activity in 2016 partially offset by increases in U.S. Technical Services and U.S. Catastrophe Services resulting from new clients. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2016 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the ongoing expansion of our contractor network, the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 59.0% for 2016 and 61.8% for 2015. The decrease was due to the impact of certain cost reduction initiatives in 2015 and improved staff utilization.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses decreased from $149.9 million in 2015 to $136.2 million in 2016. There was an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016 compared with an average of 1,491 FTEs (including 454 catastrophe adjusters) in 2015. The decrease in expenses and FTEs in 2016 was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and a decline in compensation costs and personnel required to service the outsourcing project referred to above.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased from $60.2 million in 2015 to $59.6 million in 2016, although as a percent of segment revenues, increased from 24.8% in 2015 to 25.7% in 2016. The slight decrease in costs was primarily due to the impact of a reduction of office locations in the U.S. and related administrative cost reductions. The increase in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $43.2 million in 2016, an increase of 139.1% from 2015 operating earnings of $18.1 million. The operating margin increased from 3.6% in 2015 to 9.1% in 2016. The increase in operating earnings was the result of improvements in all of our major operating regions and the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>In thousands (except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Based on actual exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Based on exchange rates for year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>104,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>108,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>92,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>477,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>499,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $477.3 million in 2016, compared to $499.9 million in 2015. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $29.4 million, or approximately 5.8%, for 2016 compared with 2015. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $506.6 million in 2016. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 12.5% in 2016 compared with 2015. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 13.8% revenue increase for 2016 compared with 2015, due primarily to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases discussed below.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2016 compared with 2015 was due to the change in foreign exchange rates. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, U.K. revenues would have increased, primarily as a result of cases received from flooding in that country during the 2016 first quarter.\nRevenues in Canada increased from 2015 due primarily to an increase from the Fort McMurray wildfires, partially offset by a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases.\nRevenues increased in Asia-Pacific due to an increase in weather-related activity in Australia, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China where we have exited that product line in those countries.\nThe lower revenues in Europe and Rest of World were due to a reduction in case volumes and changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, the change in foreign exchange rates, and a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil where we have exited that product line in that country.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues increased to $34.4 million in 2016 from $28.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the increased use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada from the Fort McMurray wildfires.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>133,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>167,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>96,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>285,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>682,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>779,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall case volumes were 12.5% lower in 2016 compared with 2015. The U.K. case volumes were higher due primarily to flooding-related cases received in the 2016 first quarter, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low complexity cases. The decrease in Canada cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in 2016 which offset the increase in cases associated with the Fort McMurray wildfires. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China described above. The reduction in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was primarily due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil described above, and a reduction of cases in Scandinavia.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased from 66.9% in 2015 to 63.7% in 2016. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased in 2016 by $30.4 million. These decreases were due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015 and improved staff utilization. There was an average of 4,236 International FTEs in this segment in 2016, a decrease from 4,645 FTEs in the 2015 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nAs a component of our acquisition of GAB Robins, the Company acquired a contractor repair business where we are the principal in the relationship with clients. As the principal in this business, both revenues and the corresponding contractor costs are reported at gross values. These contractor expenses are recorded within \"Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" They are reported in this category instead of \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor,\" as the services performed by these outside contractors are not services that can be performed by our workforce.\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 29.5% in 2015 to 27.2% in 2016, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $17.4 million. The decrease in both amount and percentage is primarily due to cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $24.0 million in 2015, or 8.2% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2015 to 2016 due to higher revenues and improved control over operating expenses.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>160,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>14,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 3.1% to $302.0 million in 2016 compared with $293.0 million in 2015. The overall increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased claims and medical management revenues as well as higher average case values in 2016.\nRevenues were positively impacted by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which increased revenues by approximately 3.6% in 2016. This increase was partially offset by unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which decreased revenues by 0.5% from 2015 to 2016.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.3 million in 2016, increasing slightly from $4.2 million in 2015 due to the growth in revenues.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>178,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>154,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>103,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>436,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, there was a 0.5% decrease in cases received in 2016 compared with 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in Medical Management case referrals, which is reported in the Other category above, partially offset by increases in workers' compensation and casualty cases resulting from new clients.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, increased to 55.4% in 2016 compared with 54.3% in 2015. The amount of these expenses increased from $159.2 million in 2015 to $167.0 million in 2016 due to the growth in revenues. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to an increase in employees and increased incentive compensation. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 1,995 in 2016, up from 1,910 FTEs in 2015. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.7% in 2016 from 37.5% in 2015, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $4.9 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in office expenses, rent and occupancy, and other administrative expenses compared with 2015.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2016 declined compared with the 2015 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2017, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported 2016 operating earnings of $7.2 million, decreasing 41.3% from $12.3 million in 2015, with the related operating margin decreasing from 9.1% in 2015 to 7.3% in 2016. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of changes in the mix of services provided and the winding down of a major gulf-related special project, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 26.8% to $98.7 million in 2016, compared with $134.8 million in 2015. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $81.0 million, the same as at December 31, 2015. Of the $81.0 million backlog at December 31, 2016, approximately $73.3 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $21.3 million in 2016, decreasing from $30.1 million in 2015. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2016.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased to 65.7% in 2016 compared with 69.0% in 2015. The decrease as a percent of revenues was due to improved employee utilization in 2016. The dollar amount of related expenses declined to $64.8 million in 2016 compared with $93.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, compared with an average of 709 FTEs in 2015, decreasing due to the decreased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 9.8% to $26.6 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 27.0% in 2016 from 21.9% in 2015. The dollar amount of these expenses decreased due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nEXPENSES AND CREDITS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS\nIncome Taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, changes in tax law, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our various domestic and international operations, which are subject to income taxes at different rates, our ability to utilize loss and tax credit carryforwards, and amounts related to uncertain income tax positions. Income tax provisions totaled $15.0 million, $25.6 million, and $13.8 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company's 2017 effective income tax rate was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. and international restructuring activities. The Company's 2015 effective income tax rate was distortive, primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, our inability to recognize tax benefits for certain international net operating losses, and fluctuations in the mix of income earned. Additionally, 2015 losses in certain operations, including losses due to restructuring and special charges, were in jurisdictions with lower tax rates or where the losses are unable to be benefited. Based on our 2018 operating plans, we anticipate our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes in 2018 to be in the 31% to 33% range before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes to U.S. tax law and policy.\nNet Corporate Interest Expense\nNet corporate interest expense consists of interest expense that we incur on our short- and long-term borrowings, partially offset by interest income we earn on available cash balances and short-term investments. These amounts vary based on interest rates, borrowings outstanding, and the amounts of invested cash. Corporate interest expense totaled $9.9 million, $9.9 million, and $9.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Corporate interest income was relatively consistent in each year, totaling $0.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We pay interest on borrowings under our Credit Facility based on variable rates. Whether we can expect to see future reductions in interest expense compared with prior periods is dependent on the future direction of interest rates as well as the level of outstanding borrowings relative to prior periods.\nStock Option Expense\nStock option expense, a component of stock-based compensation, is comprised of non-cash expenses related to stock options granted under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Stock option expense is not allocated to our operating segments. Stock option expense of $1.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million was recognized during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the 2017 period was due to a higher proportion of options having been granted in 2017 as a component of our Long Term Incentive Plans. Other stock-based compensation expense related to our Executive Stock Bonus Plan and our 2016 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (pursuant to which we have authority to grant performance shares and restricted shares) is charged to our operating segments and included in the determination of segment operating earnings or loss.\nAmortization of Customer-Relationship Intangible Assets\nAmortization of customer-relationship intangible assets represents the non-cash amortization expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled $11.0 million, $9.6 million, and $9.7 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the WeGoLook acquisition. This amortization is included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits\nCertain unallocated costs and credits are excluded from the determination of segment operating earnings. These unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent costs of our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, expenses for our chief executive officer and our Board of Directors, certain adjustments to our self-insured liabilities, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain adjustments and recoveries to our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. From time to time, we evaluate which corporate costs and credits are appropriately allocated to one or more of our operating segments. If changes are made to our allocation methodology, prior period allocations are revised to conform to our then-current allocation methodology.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits were $15.6 million, $24.0 million, and $16.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to a decrease in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, self-insured expenses, and unallocated professional fees. These costs increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to an increase in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, unallocated professional fees, and incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs and self-insured expenses.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nThe Company incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to its Garden City Group reporting unit. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nRestructuring and Special Charges\nTotal restructuring and special charges were $12.1 million for 2017, $9.5 million in 2016, and $34.4 million in 2015. See Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the restructuring and special charges.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Condition\nWe fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Company, its subsidiaries Crawford & Company Risk Services Investments Limited (the \"UK Borrower\"), Crawford & Company (Canada) Inc. (the \"Canadian Borrower\") and Crawford & Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (the \"Australian Borrower\") (the Company, together with such subsidiaries, as borrowers, the \"Borrowers\", Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender (\"Wells Fargo\"), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and a lender, Citizens Bank, N.A., as documentation agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"), which amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2011, by and among, inter alia, the Borrowers, Wells Fargo and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (as previously amended, the \"Original Credit Agreement\"). In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company, the Company's guarantor subsidiaries party thereto and Wells Fargo entered into an Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement\") and an Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement ( the \"Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement\"), each dated as of the date of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement: (i) increases the aggregate commitments under the Original Credit Agreement from $400.0 million to $450.0 million, without impacting the Company's ability, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and its receipt of additional commitments, to exercise its option to further increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $200.0 million (previously $100.0 million under the Original Credit Agreement); (ii) extends the maturity date under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to November 23, 2022 (the maturity date was November 25, 2018 under the Original Credit Agreement); (iii) reduces the interest margin ranges to 1.30% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans (previously 1.50% to 2.25%) and 0.30% to 1.10% for Base Rate loans (previously 0.50% to 1.25%); (iv) reduces the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio to 1.10 to 1.00 (previously 1.25 to 1.00); and (v) amends the leverage ratio tests to set a maximum permitted senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and set a maximum permitted total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00, among other things.\nThe credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Facility\") consists of a $450.0 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subfacility of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility contains sublimits of $185.0 million for borrowings by the UK Borrower, $75.0 million for borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, and $32.5 million for borrowings by the Australian Borrower. The Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding thereunder, will be due and payable on November 23, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Euros, the currencies of Canada, Japan, Australia or United Kingdom and, subject to the terms of the Credit Facility, other currencies. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the applicable Borrower, based on the Base Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), in each case plus an applicable interest margin based on the Company's leverage ratio (as defined below), provided that borrowings in foreign currencies may bear interest based on LIBOR only. The interest margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 1.30% to 2.10% and for Base Rate loans ranges from 0.30% to 1.10%. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent and (iii) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus 1.0%.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, a total of $224.3 million and $186.2 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition, undrawn commitments under letters of credit totaling $14.5 million and $14.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the letters of credit subfacility of the Credit Facility. These letter of credit commitments were for the Company's own obligations. Including the amounts committed under the letters of credit subfacility, the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $241.3 million and $198.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each existing material domestic subsidiary of the Company, certain other domestic subsidiaries of the Company and certain existing material foreign subsidiaries of the Company that are disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes (each such foreign subsidiary, a \"Disregarded Foreign Entity\"), and such obligations are required to be guaranteed by each subsequently acquired or formed material domestic subsidiary and Disregarded Foreign Entity (each, a \"Guarantor\"), and the obligations of the Borrowers other than the Company (\"Foreign Borrowers\") for which the Company is not the primary obligor are also guaranteed by the Company. In addition, (i) the Borrowers' obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien (subject to liens permitted by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) on substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the Guarantors as set forth in the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement and (ii) the obligations of the Foreign Borrowers are secured by a first priority lien on 100% of the capital stock of the Foreign Borrowers.\nThe representations, covenants and events of default in the Credit Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including required compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio (each as defined below).\nUnder the Credit Facility the fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\") minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nThe leverage ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated EBITDA, must not be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility. If the Company does not meet the covenant requirements in the future, it would be in default under the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the Credit Facility and ancillary documents.\nWe are not aware of any additional restrictions placed on us, or being considered to be placed on us, related to our ability to access capital, such as borrowings under the Credit Facility. We do not rely on repurchase agreements or the commercial paper market to meet our short-term or long-term funding needs. For additional information on the key covenants contained in our Credit Facility, see \"Other Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nWe continue the ongoing monitoring of our customers' ability to pay us for the services that we render to them. Based on historical results, we currently believe there is a low likelihood that write-offs of our existing accounts receivable will have a material impact on our financial results. However, if one or more of our key customers files bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to make required payments to us, or if overall economic conditions deteriorate, we may need to make material provisions in the future to increase our allowance for accounts receivable.\nThe operations of our International segment expose us to a number of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies, as well as the risk of changes in tax rates or tarriffs on earnings or services provided outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with the other functional currencies in certain of the locations in which we do business negatively impacted our revenues and operating earnings in 2017, 2016, and 2015. We cannot predict the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on our future revenues or operating earnings in our International segment.\nAt December 31, 2017, our working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $113.8 million, compared with $134.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was due to an increase in short-term borrowings largely to fund the WeGoLook acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 totaled $54.0 million, compared with $81.6 million at the end of 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily related to certain international cash balances being utilized to reduce foreign borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $17.8 million held in the U.S. and $36.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. The Company generally does not provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company's current expectation is that such earnings will be reinvested by the subsidiaries or will be repatriated only when it would be tax effective or otherwise strategically beneficial to the Company, such as if a very unusual event or project generated profits significantly in excess of ongoing business reinvestment needs. If such an event occurs, we would analyze the potential tax impact or our anticipated investment needs in that region and provide for taxes for earnings that are not expected to be permanently reinvested. Other historical earnings and future foreign earnings necessary for business reinvestment are expected to remain permanently reinvested and will be used to provide working capital for these operations, fund defined benefit pension plan obligations, repay non-U.S. debt, fund capital improvements, and fund future acquisitions. We currently believe that funds expected to be generated from our U.S. operations, along with potential borrowing capabilities in the U.S., will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operations and other obligations, including our funding obligations under our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, except in limited circumstances such as those described above, do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our U.S. operations. However, if at a future date or time these funds are necessary for our operations in the U.S. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto, or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition. No additional income or withholding taxes have been provided for any undistributed foreign earnings, other than those subject to the Transition Tax nor have any taxes been provided for outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Additionally, due to withholding tax, basis computations, and other related tax considerations, it is not practicable to estimate any taxes to be provided on outside basis differences at this time. The ultimate tax impact related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretation and assumptions, or issuance of additional guidance issued by the relevant tax authorities and we will continue to refine these estimates and our indefinite reinvestment assertion in accordance with SAB 118.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $58.1 million in 2017, from $98.9 million in 2016 to $40.8 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in accrued incentive compensation, accounts payable, and pension liabilities, and an increase in receivables and prepaid expenses. Interest payments on our debt were $8.4 million in 2017, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $15.6 million in 2017. During the 2016 period the Company settled a cross currency swap for $4.1 million increasing cash from operations for the prior year period.\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $37.2 million in 2016, from $61.7 million in 2015 to $98.9 million in 2016. This increase was largely due to higher net income and a decrease in working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest payments on our debt were $8.5 million in 2016, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $16.2 million in 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities increased by $48.9 million in 2017, from $33.0 million in 2016 to $81.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to $36.0 million for the acquisition of WeGoLook and certain non-compete agreements as discussed in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses.\" Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $44.9 million in 2017 compared with $29.2 million in 2016. This increase also includes costs incurred for the consolidation and relocation of our Atlanta Support Center as discussed in Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases.\" We forecast that our property and equipment additions in 2018, including capitalized software, will approximate $45 million due to investments required to fund initiatives in our three-year strategic plan.\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $68.2 million in 2016, from $101.2 million in 2015 to $33.0 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $68.3 million in cash payments for business acquisitions in 2015. Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $29.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.9 million in 2015.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $10.3 million in 2017. In 2017, we borrowed $94.4 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $58.5 million in short-term borrowings and $1.2 million in debt and capital lease obligations. The increase in borrowings in the 2017 period was primarily due to borrowings to fund the WeGoLook acquisition and increased working capital requirements. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.7 million. Also in 2017, we repurchased shares of CRD-A and CRD-B stock totaling $7.4 million, and we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.9 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nCash used by financing activities was $55.2 million in 2016. We borrowed $80.2 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $118.0 million in short-term borrowings and $1.5 million in debt and capital lease obligations. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.6 million. Also in 2016, we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.3 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nOther Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term debt obligations typically peak during the first quarter of each year due to the payment of incentive compensation awards, contributions to retirement plans, and certain other recurring payments, and generally decline during the balance of the year. Our maximum month-end short-term debt obligations were $32.0 million and $23.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our average month-end short-term debt obligations were $8.3 million and $13.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings, excluding outstanding but undrawn letters of credit under our Credit Facility, was $24.6 million and $30 thousand at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The balance in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017 represents amounts under our revolving Credit Facility that we expect, but are not required, to repay in the next twelve months. We have historically used the proceeds from our long-term borrowings to finance, among other things, business acquisitions.\nAs described above, we have two principal financial covenants in our Credit Facility. The leverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio, defined in our Credit Facility as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\"). This ratio must not exceed 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated EBITDA minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all required ratios under our Credit Facility. Based on our financial plans, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with all required covenants throughout 2018. Our compliance with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in our EBITDA, and if our financial plans for 2018 or other future periods do not meet our current projections, we could fail to remain in compliance with these financial covenants in our Credit Facility.\nOur compliance with the leverage ratio covenant is also sensitive to changes in our level of consolidated total funded debt, as defined in our Credit Facility. In addition to short- and long-term borrowings, capital leases, and bank overdrafts, among other things, consolidated total funded debt includes letters of credit, the need for which can fluctuate based on our business requirements. An increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility could negatively impact our leverage ratio, unless those increased borrowings are offset by a corresponding increase in our EBITDA. In addition, a reduction in EBITDA in the future could limit our ability to utilize available credit under the Credit Facility, which could negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nOur compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, which measures our ability to pay certain recurring expenses such as interest and lease payments, is also sensitive to the level of capital expenditures and restricted payments, as defined in our Credit Facility. A decrease in EBITDA could negatively impact our fixed charge coverage ratio, as could increases in our capital expenditures, interest expense, tax expense or restricted payments. If we do not manage those items carefully, we could be in default under the Credit Agreement, which would negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nWe believe our current financial resources, together with funds generated from operations and existing and potential borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to maintain our current operations for the next 12 months.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the impact that our contractual obligations, including estimated interest payments, are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:\n(Note references in the following table refer to the note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (Note 6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portions (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>24,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total, before interest payments\n</td> <td>64,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments under Credit Facility\n</td> <td>10,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>439,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Assumes principal amounts are repaid at maturity and not refinanced.\nApproximately $17.2 million of operating lease obligations included in the table above are expected to be funded by sublessors under existing sublease agreements. See Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate, based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, in either case plus an applicable margin. Long-term debt refers to the required principal repayment at maturity of the Credit Facility, and may differ significantly from estimates, due to, among other things, actual amounts outstanding at maturity or any refinancings prior to such date. Interest amounts are based on projected borrowings under our Credit Facility and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2017, and the actual interest payments may differ significantly from estimates due to, among other things, changes in outstanding borrowings and prevailing interest rates in the future.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $11.3 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We expect $6.2 million in reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.\nGross deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $51.1 million. This amount is not included in the contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, we believe scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\nDefined Benefit Pension Funding and Cost\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., (the \"U.S. Qualified Plan\") three defined benefit plans in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Plans\"), and defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the Philippines (the \"other international plans\"). Future cash funding of our defined benefit pension plans will depend largely on future investment performance, interest rates, changes to mortality tables, and regulatory requirements. Effective December 31, 2002, we froze our U.S. Qualified Plan. The aggregate deficit in the funded status of the U.S. Plan and other international plans totaled $87.0 million and $105.2 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 decrease in the unfunded deficit of our defined benefit pension plans primarily resulted from the return on plan assets, contributions and adoption of updated mortality tables used to determine U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities. During 2017, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.6 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. In 2016, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.1 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. The U.K. Plans were in a funded status totaling $34.7 million and $21.6 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the projected benefit obligation. There was a $13.1 million increase during 2017 in the net prepaid pension balances of the U.K. defined benefit plan that is in an overfunded position.\nOur frozen U.S. Qualified Plan was underfunded by $85.8 million at December 31, 2017 based on an accumulated benefit obligation of $474.6 million. Crawford expects to make discretionary contributions of $9.0 million per annum to the U.S. Qualified Plan for the next five fiscal years to improve the funded status of the plan and minimize future required contributions. We estimate that we will make the following annual minimum contributions over the next five years to our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.K. Plans:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>Estimated U.S. Pension Funding\n</td> <td>Estimated U.K. Pension Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunding requirements are no longer as sensitive to changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the U.S. Qualified plan. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\"BBA2015\") included pension funding reform which greatly reduced the contributions required to the U.S. Qualified Plan. In addition to BBA2015 legislation, pension funding has been governed by rules under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended by the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, and the Highway Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Volatility in the capital markets and future legislation may have a negative impact on our U.S., U.K. and other international pension plans, which may further increase the underfunded portion of our pension plans and our attendant funding obligations. Expected and required contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans will reduce our liquidity, restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to deploy capital to other opportunities.\nCommercial Commitments\nAs a component of our Credit Facility, we maintain a letter of credit facility to satisfy certain contractual obligations. At December 31, 2017, the issued, but undrawn, letters of credit totaled approximately $14.5 million. These letters of credit are typically renewed annually, but unless renewed, will expire as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, which could materially impact our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have certain material obligations under operating lease agreements to which we are a party. In accordance with GAAP, these operating lease obligations and the related leased assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe maintain funds in trusts to administer claims for certain clients. These funds are not available for our general operating activities and, as such, have not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have concluded that we do not have material off-balance sheet financial risk related to these funds at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nThe following addresses changes in our financial condition not addressed elsewhere in this MD&A.\nSignificant changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, compared with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, were as follows:\n \u2022 Accounts receivable increased by $20.6 million, or $14.8 million excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange impacts and other adjustments, in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased receivables in U.S. Services related to the hurricane activity and International operations. \n \u2022 Prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets increased by $17.6 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase of $13.1 million in the net prepaid pension balances of the U.K. defined benefit plan that is in a overfunded position. \n \u2022 Noncurrent deferred income tax assets decreased by $5.0 million primarily due to the tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., the adjustments to retirement liabilities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the utilization of foreign tax credits and net operating losses. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis MD&A addresses our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under then-existing circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes in these underlying estimates could potentially materially affect consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of change. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the amounts provided for are based on the best information available to us and we believe these estimates are reasonable.\nWe have discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this MD&A.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of claims processing or program administration fees. Fees for professional services are recognized as unbilled revenues at estimated collectible amounts at the time such services are rendered. Substantially all unbilled revenues are billed within one year. Out-of-pocket costs incurred in administering a claim are typically passed on to our clients and included in our revenues under GAAP. Deferred revenues represent the estimated unearned portion of fees related to future services to be performed under certain fixed-fee service arrangements. Deferred revenues are recognized into revenues based on the estimated rate at which the services are provided. These rates are primarily based on an evaluation of historical claim closing rates by major claim type. Additionally, recent claim closing rates are evaluated to ensure that current claim closing history does not indicate a significant deterioration or improvement in the longer-term historical closing rates used.\nOur fixed-fee service arrangements typically require us to handle claims on either a one- or two-year basis, or for the lifetime of the claim. In cases where we handle a claim on a non-lifetime basis, we typically receive an additional fee on each anniversary date that the claim remains open. For service arrangements where we provide services for the life of the claim, we are only paid one fee for the life of the claim, regardless of the duration of the claim. As a result, our deferred revenues for claims handled for one or two years are not as sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since the revenues are recognized in the near future, and additional fees are generated for handling long-lived claims. Deferred revenues for lifetime claim handling are considered more sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since we are obligated to handle these claims to their conclusion with no additional fees received for long-lived claims. For all fixed fee service arrangements, revenues are recognized over the expected service periods, by type of claim.\nBased upon our historical averages, we close approximately 98% of all cases referred to us under lifetime claim service arrangements within five years from the date of referral. Also, within that five-year period, the percentage of cases remaining open in any one particular year has remained relatively consistent from period to period. Each quarter we evaluate our historical case closing rates by type of claim and make adjustments as necessary. Any changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined.\nAs of December 31, 2017, deferred revenues related to lifetime claim handling arrangements approximated $41.8 million. If the rate at which we close cases changes, the amount of revenues recognized within a period could be affected. In addition, given the competitive environment in which we operate, we may be unable to raise our prices to offset the additional expense associated with handling longer-lived claims should such case closing rates change. The change in our first-year case closing rates over the last ten years has ranged from a decrease of 3.6% to an increase of 4.8%, and has averaged an increase of 0.2%. A 1.0% change is a reasonably likely change in our estimate based on historical data. Absent an increase in per-claim fees from our clients, a 1.0% decrease in claim closing rates for lifetime claims would have resulted in the deferral of additional revenues of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. If our average claim closing rates for lifetime claims increased by 1.0%, we would have recognized additional revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company has contracts with multi-element arrangements. The Company often sells multiple lines of claims processing and different levels of processing depending on the complexity of the claims within a contract. The Company typically provides a menu of offerings from which the customer chooses to purchase or not at their discretion. The price of each service is separate and distinct and provides a separate and distinct value to the customer. Pricing is consistent for each service irrespective of the other service(s) or quantities requested by the customer. For example, if we provide claims processing for auto and general liability, those services are priced and delivered independently.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments and for adjustments to invoiced amounts. Losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments are accounted for as bad debt expense, while adjustments to invoices are accounted for as reductions to revenues. These allowances are established by using historical write-off or adjustment information intended to determine future loss expectations and by considering the current credit worthiness of our clients, any known specific collection problems, and our assessment of current industry conditions. Actual experience may differ significantly from historical or expected loss results. Each quarter, we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in determining these allowances and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $12.6 million and $14.5 million, or approximately 6.7% and 8.6% of gross billed receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to us, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed to be appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 1.0% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other long-lived assets have been impaired. Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets (tangible and intangible) acquired in certain business combinations. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names associated with acquired businesses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing at least annually. When factors indicate that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment between the scheduled annual impairment tests, we perform an interim impairment test. Our other long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, deferred income tax assets, capitalized software, and amortizable intangible assets related to customer relationships, technology, and trade names with finite lives. Other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are identified.\nWe currently have five reporting units for goodwill impairment purposes. These reporting units are our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations, our U.S. Contractor Connection operations on a stand-alone basis, and our other operating segments - International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group.\nIn the annual impairment analysis of goodwill, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair values of those reporting units as determined by a combination of the income approach, specifically discounting future projected cash flows, and the market approach, specifically the Guideline Public Company Method, as described in more detail in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We perform an interim impairment analysis of goodwill when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are based upon certain assumptions made by us. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are reconciled to the Company's total market value as determined by its stock price in order to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed on a reporting unit basis. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The loss recognized cannot subsequently be reversed.\nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the quantitative analysis described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If we conclude that this is the case, we perform the quantitative analysis discussed above.\nThe estimated fair value of our U.S. Contractor Connection operations, International, and Broadspire reporting units exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. The estimated fair value of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit exceeds its carrying value but not by as much of a margin. The U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit has $19.4 million of goodwill at risk of potential future impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 125 basis points could potentially trigger an impairment of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit goodwill, assuming no change in the other key inputs. The Company recognized goodwill impairment charges for the entire goodwill allocated to its Garden City Group reporting unit of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017 due to the reporting unit achieving less than forecasted revenue and operating earnings and based on future expected operating results. We intend to continue to monitor the performance of our reporting units for potential indicators of impairment. If impairment indicators exist, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units utilizing the income approach include the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The discount rates utilized in estimating the fair value of our reporting units in 2017 range between 10.0% and 13.5%, reflecting our assessment of a market participant's view of the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The terminal growth rate used in the analysis was 2.0%. The assumptions used in estimating the fair values are based on currently available data and management's best estimates of revenues and cash flows and, accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names, with carrying values of $29.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, are also evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of potential impairment are identified. Based on our 2017 analysis, we do not believe these trade names are impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test involves estimating the fair value using an internally prepared discounted cash flow analysis. The fair values of the Company's trade names are established using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This method recognizes that, by virtue of owning the trade name as opposed to licensing it, a company or reporting unit is relieved from paying a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of net sales, for the asset's use. The present value of the after-tax costs savings (i.e., royalty relief) at an appropriate discount rate including a tax amortization benefit indicates the value of the trade name. We determined the discount rate based on our performance compared to similar market participants, factored by risk in forecasting using a modified capital asset pricing model.\nThe values of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names are each sensitive to changes in the assumptions used above. The estimated fair value of our Broadspire and SLS trade names exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. An increase in the discount rate by 2.5% could potentially trigger an impairment of the WeGoLook trade name, assuming no changes in the other key inputs. We will continue to monitor the value of these trade names for potential indicators of impairment.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. that cover a substantial number of current and former employees in each location. Certain other employees located in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Philippines have retirement benefits that are accounted for as defined benefit pension plans under GAAP. We utilize the services of independent actuaries to help us estimate our pension obligations and measure pension costs. Our U.S. Qualified Plan was frozen on December 31, 2002. Our U.K. Plans were closed to new employees as of October 31, 1997, but existing participants may still accrue additional limited benefits based on salary levels existing at the close date. Benefits payable under our U.S. Qualified Plan are generally based on career compensation; however, no additional benefits accrue on our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan after December 31, 2002. Benefits payable under the U.K. Plans are generally based on an employee's salary at the time the applicable plan was closed. Our funding policy is to make cash contributions in amounts sufficient to maintain the plans on an actuarially sound basis, but not in excess of amounts deductible under applicable income tax regulations. Note 8, \"Retirement Plans,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides details about the assumptions used in determining the funded status of the plans, the unrecognized actuarial gain/(loss), the components of net periodic benefit cost, benefit payments expected to be made in the future and plan asset allocations.\nInvestment objectives for the Company's U.S. and U.K. pension plan assets are to:\n \u2022 ensure availability of funds for payment of plan benefits as they become due; \n \u2022 provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to volatility, and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power; and \n \u2022 provide investment results that meet or exceed the plans' actuarially assumed long-term rate of return. \nThe long-term goal for the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans is to reach fully-funded status and to maintain that status. The investment policies contemplate the plans' asset return requirements and risk tolerances changing over time. Accordingly, reallocation of the portfolios' mix of return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets will be performed as the plans' funded status improves. In conjunction with our investment policies we have rebalanced the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans' target allocation mix from an equity-weighted to a fixed-income weighted investment strategy, as we have made cash contributions to the plan and the plans' funded status has improved.\nThe rules for pension accounting are complex and the assumptions used can produce volatility in our results, financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the measurement date). Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which are subject to volatility.\nIn addition to expense volatility, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension plans. These adjustments have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and, like our pension expense, are a result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at each measurement date, as well as periodic changes to mortality tables used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. The funded status of our plans may also impact our liquidity, as changes to funding laws in the U.S. may require higher funding levels for our pension plans.\nThe principal assumptions used in accounting for our defined benefit pension plans are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, and the mortality expectations for plan participants. The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Our discount rates were determined with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. At December 31, 2017, the discount rate used to compute the benefit obligations of the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans were 3.63% and 2.61%, respectively.\nThe estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in collective funds. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities as described above.\nEstablishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:\n \u2022 the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets; \n \u2022 the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time; and \n \u2022 the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. \nWe review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. As a result of the transition to a liability-driven investment strategy described previously, the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption used to determine 2018 net periodic pension cost were estimated to be 6.20% and 3.85% for the U.S. and U.K. plans, respectively.\nWe review our employee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary. During 2017, we revised the mortality assumptions for the U.S. plans to incorporate the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect Company-specific experience and future expectations. This resulted in a $3.2 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. plans.\nPension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the calculated value method. The amounts recognized in the balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date and the effect of mark-to-market accounting on plan assets. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an increase to equity through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") of $0.7 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2017. At December 31, 2016, we recorded an increase to equity through OCI of $11.3 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2016. Those changes are subject to amortization over future years and may be reflected in future income statements.\nCumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for all plans were $268.5 million through December 31, 2017, compared with $280.0 million through December 31, 2016. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the discount rates, differences between expected and actual asset returns, and changes to mortality expectations for plan participants, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless the minimum amount required to be amortized is below a corridor amount equal to 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future periods. For example, projected pension plan expense for 2018 includes $10.3 million of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $11.2 million in 2017, $12.8 million in 2016 and $13.4 million in 2015.\nNet periodic pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions for the expected rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans. If our assumptions for the expected returns on plan assets of our U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans changed by 0.5%, representing either an increase or decrease in expected returns, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $3.3 million. If our assumptions for the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans changed by 0.25%, representing either an increase or decrease in interest rates used to value pension plan liabilities, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $0.8 million.\nBeginning with the December 31, 2016 measurement, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for U.S. and international pension and other postretirement benefits. This new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. Historically, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.\nWe made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. While the benefit obligation measured under this approach is unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates reduced the service and interest cost for the pension plans for fiscal 2017 by $3.2 million. We do not expect this change will have a material effect in periods beyond 2017. For the pension plans, the weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs were 3.23% for the Company's U.S. plans and 2.66% for the U.K. plans.\nDetermination of Effective Tax Rate Used for Financial Reporting\nWe account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred taxes are made in recognition of these temporary differences. The most significant differences relate to revenue recognition, accrued compensation and pensions, self-insurance, and depreciation and amortization.\nFor financial reporting purposes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to our income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our consolidated balance sheets that are not related to balances in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon changes between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for income tax purposes, multiplied by the enacted statutory tax rates for the year in which we estimate these differences will reverse. We must estimate the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, as well as whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nOther factors which influence our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes include changes in enacted statutory tax rates, changes in tax law or policy, changes in the composition of taxable income from the countries in which we operate, our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nOur effective tax rate, defined as our provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, for financial reporting purposes in 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)%, respectively. If our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes changed by 1.0%, we would have recognized an increase or decrease to income taxes of approximately $421,000, $635,000, and $316,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes is expected to range between 31% and 33% in 2018 before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes in tax law or policy.\nIt is possible that future changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate, including but not limited to changes in tax law or policy, could have a significant impact on U.S.-based multinational companies such as our Company. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood or details of any such changes or their specific potential impact on our Company.\nOur most significant deferred tax assets are related to the unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans, tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards. The tax deduction for defined benefit pension plans generally occurs upon funding of plan liabilities. Assuming that the estimated minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and the income projections are met, the deferred tax asset should be realized.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we have considered the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards and have an $18.8 million valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in our international and domestic operations. For our remaining deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets based on our forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that are available to the Company. Future changes in the valuation allowance, if required, should not affect our liquidity or our compliance with any existing debt covenants.\nOur tax credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded a valuation allowance primarily consist of $22.0 million of foreign tax credit (\"FTC\") carryforwards, which materially expire in 2020. Companies that cannot credit all the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid in a particular tax year because their foreign taxes exceed their FTC limitation are allowed to carry their excess taxes back to the preceding tax year and then forward to the ten succeeding years. Utilization of our FTCs is dependent upon sufficient U.S. regular taxable income and foreign source income in the relevant foreign tax credit basket which is impacted by the interaction of overall domestic and overall foreign loss rules. Based on our projections of income through 2020, including the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., we expect to fully utilize the FTC carryforwards before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the FTC carryforwards will be utilized.\nThe NOL carryforwards for which a valuation allowance is not recorded primarily consists of $11.4 million of U.K. NOL carryforwards and $8.0 million of state NOL carryforwards generated by our domestic companies.\nIn the U.K., NOL carryforwards have an unlimited life. Based on our evaluation of sources of taxable income, we expect to fully utilize the U.K. NOL carryforwards. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we should be able to utilize our U.K. NOL carryforwards.\nIn order to fully utilize these state NOL carryforwards, our domestic operations must generate taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards. Based on our projections of income, the Company expects to fully utilize its state NOL carryforwards in the majority of jurisdictions before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards for these jurisdictions. There are certain states with unique rules that result in the Company not expecting to utilize the state NOL carryforwards before expiration. For those jurisdictions, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards and a valuation allowance was recorded. The valuation allowance against state NOL carryforwards was $0.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe remaining NOL carryforwards were generated by certain foreign jurisdictions and are generally offset by full valuation allowances.\nSelf-Insured Risks\nWe self-insure certain insurable risks consisting primarily of professional liability, auto liability, employee medical, disability, and workers' compensation. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures, including professional liability on a claims-made basis, and those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Most of these self-insured risks are in the U.S. Provisions for claims incurred under self-insured programs are made based on our estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred, including estimated legal fees, losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us, and the adverse developments on reported losses. These estimated liabilities are calculated based on historical claim payment experience, the expected life of the claims, and other factors considered relevant to the claims. The liabilities for claims incurred under our self-insured workers' compensation and employee disability programs are discounted at the prevailing risk-free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration. All other self-insured liabilities are undiscounted. Each quarter we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in developing these estimated liabilities and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our estimated liabilities for self-insured risks totaled $22.9 million and $26.3 million, respectively. The estimated liability is most sensitive to changes in the ultimate liability for a claim and, if applicable, the interest rate used to discount the liability. We believe our provisions for self-insured losses are adequate to cover the expected cost of losses incurred, net of insurance recoveries. However, these provisions are estimates and amounts ultimately settled may be significantly greater or less than the provisions established. We used a discount rate of 2.05% to determine the present value of our self-insured workers' compensation liabilities as of December 31, 2017. If the average discount rate was reduced by 1.0% or increased by 1.0%, reflecting either an increase or decrease in underlying interest rates, our estimated liabilities for these self-insured risks at December 31, 2017 would have been impacted by approximately $529,000, resulting in an increase or decrease to 2017 consolidated net income of approximately $329,000.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is the world's largest publicly listed independent provider of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford Solution\u00ae offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management; workers' compensation claims and medical management; and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRD-A and CRD-B, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of the Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. U.S. Services primarily serves the U.S. property and casualty insurance company markets. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the self-insurance marketplace, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S.\nInsurance companies rely on us for certain services such as field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. Our Contractor Connection service line provides a managed contractor network to insurance carriers and consumer markets.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is highly competitive but is comprised of a limited number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, the volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks outlined in each project.\nOn January 4, 2017, the Company acquired 85% of the outstanding membership interests of WeGoLook\u00ae, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, and certain non-compete agreements, for consideration of $36,125,000 on a debt free valuation basis. WeGoLook provides a variety of on-demand inspection, verification, and other field services for businesses and consumers through a mobile platform of independent contractors.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in the Philippines. We have subsequently expanded our offshore operations to include Information Technology services performed in India. The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which will continue to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all. Costs associated with the establishment and phase-in of the Centers were $0.4 million in 2017, $3.7 million in 2016, and $4.4 million in 2015. Costs to be incurred in 2018 are not expected to be significant.\nIn 2015 we announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included restructuring and integration costs and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges, exclusive of costs related to the establishment and phase-in of the Centers, for these and other similar plans totaled $11.6 million in 2017, $5.7 million in 2016 and $30.0 million in 2015. We do not anticipate any restructuring and special charges in 2018.\nNon-cash goodwill impairment charges for 2017 were $19.6 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. Federal income tax law. The changes include, but are not limited to: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, creation of a new minimum tax on global intangible low taxed income ( GILTI\u201d), and a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax\u201d) as a result of the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) of net tax expense of $3.8 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This expense consists of provisional estimates of $7.6 million net expense for the Transition Tax, which we estimate will be fully offset by foreign tax credit carryforwards, and $3.8 million net benefit for remeasurement of our domestic deferred tax balances for the corporate rate reduction.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including GILTI, executive compensation, Transition Tax including associated foreign tax credits, and state taxes. Additionally, any changes to these provisional estimates would require us to reassess the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether GILTI taxes would be recorded as a current period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax impacts related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017. We will continue to refine these estimates in accordance with SAB 118.\nSee Note 7, \"Income Taxes\u201d of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.106 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.3% compared with $1.109 billion in 2016. Net income attributable to Crawford & Company was $27.7 million in 2017, compared with $36.0 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $12.1 million compared to $9.5 million in 2016.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services, International and Broadspire segments from 2016 to 2017. We experienced an operating earnings decline in our Garden City Group segment from 2016 to 2017.\nCompared with 2016, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements decreased 0.3% in 2017 due primarily to revenue declines in the International and Garden City Group segments, partially offset by an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services and Broadspire segments. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were also impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are now acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients related to our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million revenue reduction for the 2017 period as compared to the prior year.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings increased slightly from 2016 to 2017 due to incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the current year, partially offset by the initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nOperating earnings in our International segment increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nGarden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a decline in revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017, which negatively impacted operating earnings.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were slightly lower in 2017 than in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in professional fees and other administrative expenses, partially offset by costs associated with a branding campaign in our U.S. Services segment compared with the 2016 period.\nSegment Operating Earnings\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business, but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, establishment of new operations, and asset impairments) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of operations. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\n\nnm = not meaningful\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased slightly from $35.6 million in 2016 to $35.7 million in 2017, representing an operating margin of 13.2% in 2017 compared with 15.4% in 2016. Operating earnings increased from 2016 to 2017 due to the incremental revenues and associated earnings in U.S. Claims Services due to cases received from hurricanes in the current year, partially offset by initial start-up costs and operating losses attributable to WeGoLook and costs associated with a branding campaign in 2017 to further expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was an increase in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2017 compared with 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in weather-related activity resulting from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which positively impacted all of our U.S. Claims Services service lines. Revenues were also positively impacted by the acquisition of WeGoLook, representing a 3.8% positive variance in 2017 compared with 2016.\nWithin U.S. Claims Services, the increase in weather-related revenues was primarily in U.S. Catastrophe Services although U.S. Claims Field Operations and U.S. Technical Services revenues were also positively impacted by cases received from the hurricane activity. There was an increase in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of 38.7% over 2016. Excluding the impact of high-frequency, low-complexity cases received from the WeGoLook acquisition, there was an increase in segment unit volume of 9.2%. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 9.6% in 2017 compared with 2016.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $20.7 million of revenues in 2017, compared with $34.9 million in 2016. This represents a 6.1% decrease in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 1.7% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks, although the rate of growth in 2017 was lower than recent years.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $10.3 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The 2017 increase was due to the increased revenues, primarily resulting from the hurricane activity.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was a 38.7% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2017 compared to 2016. This was primarily due to the WeGoLook acquisition, which accounted for 29.5% of the increase in U.S. Services cases. Absent the high-frequency, low-complexity cases from the WeGoLook acquisition, total cases received increased by 9.2% in 2017 compared to the 2016 period. This increase is due to an increase in weather-related case activity, primarily in our Catastrophe Services service line, as a result of cases received from hurricanes in the 2017 period. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2017 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 63.0% for 2017 and 59.0% for 2016. The increase was primarily due to the incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes in 2017.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses increased from $136.2 million in 2016 to $169.6 million in 2017. There was an average of 1,515 FTEs (including 365 catastrophe adjusters) in 2017 compared with an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016. The increase in expenses and FTEs in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in employees related to the higher revenues, and the WeGoLook acquisition which resulted in an increase of 115 employees in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased from $59.6 million in 2016 to $64.3 million in 2017, although as a percent of segment revenues, decreased from 25.7% in 2016 to 23.9% in 2017. The increase in amount was due to the higher revenues and incremental costs to mobilize staff in areas affected by the hurricanes, and a branding campaign to expand the presence of Contractor Connection in the consumer repair market. The decrease in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $47.2 million in 2017, an increase of 9.2% from 2016 operating earnings of $43.2 million. The operating margin increased from 9.1% in 2016 to 10.5% in 2017. The increase in operating earnings was the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\n\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $449.9 million in 2017, compared to $477.3 million in 2016. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $8.5 million, or approximately 1.7%, for 2017 compared with 2016. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $458.4 million in 2017. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 3.0% in 2017 compared with 2016. Revenues in the International segment were negatively impacted due to a change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business where we are acting in an agency role instead of the contract principal in certain relationships with clients in our Contractor Connection service line, which represents a $16.0 million, or 3.4% revenue reduction, for 2017 compared to the prior year. This change had no impact on operating earnings. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.4% revenue increase for 2017 compared with 2016.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2017 compared with 2016 was due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, the change in foreign exchange rates and a reduction in weather-related activity compared with the number of cases received from flooding in that region in 2016. The change in revenues from the U.K. contractor repair business operating model was directly offset within operating expenses and had no impact on operating earnings.\nRevenues in Canada increased due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity case volumes from existing clients, and the change in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a reduction in weather-related case volumes and cases from the Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016.\nRevenues increased slightly in Asia-Pacific due to changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Asia-Pacific would have decreased slightly due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity cases, partially offset by an increase in revenues in Australia due to weather-related activity.\nThe revenue decrease in Europe and Rest of World was due to changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, partially offset by an increase in Peru due to an increase in weather-related activity and an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues decreased to $30.5 million in 2017 from $34.4 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower revenues in the 2017 period, and reduced use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada where the Fort McMurray wildfires occurred in 2016.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nOverall case volumes were 3.0% lower in 2017 compared with 2016. The U.K. case volumes were lower in the 2017 period due primarily to flooding-related cases received in 2016. The increase in Canada cases was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in the 2017 period. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was primarily due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China. The increase in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Germany and an increase in weather-related activity in Peru.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, increased from 63.7% in 2016 to 65.0% in 2017. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to lower revenues. Excluding the impact of the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above, direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements would have been 62.8% in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses decreased in 2017 by $11.6 million. The decrease was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives, a reduction in employees, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. There was an average of 4,202 International FTEs in this segment in 2017, a decrease from an average of 4,236 FTEs in the 2016 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 27.2% in 2016 to 24.5% in 2017, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $19.7 million. Expenses decreased by 2.6% due to the change in the operating model in the U.K. contractor repair business discussed above. The decrease in amount was due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives and changes in exchange rates. The decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues is primarily due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2016 and 2017.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $32.7 million in 2017, or 10.6% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2016 to 2017 due to higher revenues in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, operational efficiency gains, and a reduction in administrative support costs.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\n\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 2.7% to $310.1 million in 2017 compared with $302.0 million in 2016. The overall increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management service line, as growth from new Disability clients continues. There were also increases in Medical Management revenues and Risk Management Information Services due to increased referrals in 2017.\nRevenues were positively impacted by an increase in unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which increased revenues by 8.6% from 2016 to 2017. This increase was partially offset by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which decreased revenues by approximately 5.9% in 2017. This change is primarily due to an increase in cases in the Disability service line which has lower average case values than Workers' Compensation and Liability cases.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.1 million in 2017, decreasing slightly from $4.3 million in 2016 due to a reduction in Claims Management referrals.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was an 8.6% increase in cases received in 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in Disability case referrals from new clients, and an increase Medical Management referrals, both of which are reported in the Other category above. This increase was partially offset by declines in Workers' Compensation and Casualty cases from existing clients. The reduction in Casualty cases was due to a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity affinity claims.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased slightly from 55.4% in 2016 to 55.3% in 2017. The amount of these expenses increased from $167.0 million in 2016 to $171.5 million in 2017 due to an increase in employees related to the growth in revenues. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 2,054 in 2017, up from an average of 1,995 FTEs in 2016. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues. The slight decrease in expenses as a percent of revenues was due to the higher revenues in the 2017 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased slightly as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.2% in 2017 from 34.7% in 2016, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $1.0 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in rent and occupancy and other administrative expenses compared with 2016.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2017 declined compared with the 2016 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project, and a lower volume of case administration work on projects in the 2017 period. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2018, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported a 2017 operating loss of $(4.4) million, decreasing 160.5% from $7.2 million operating earnings in 2016, with the related operating margin decreasing from 7.3% in 2016 to (5.7)% in 2017. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of the winding down of the special project, lower volumes discussed above, and a reduction in employee utilization.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 22.8% to $76.2 million in 2017, compared with $98.7 million in 2016. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above, and a lower volume of case administration work on new and existing projects in 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $66.0 million, compared to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. Of the $66.0 million backlog at December 31, 2017, approximately $40.0 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $13.0 million in 2017, decreasing from $21.3 million in 2016. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2017.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, increased to 71.2% in 2017 compared with 65.7% in 2016. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to the decline in revenues and excess capacity resulting from a decrease in employee utilization in 2017. The U.S. dollar amount of related expenses declined to $54.2 million in 2017 compared with $64.8 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 467 FTEs in 2017, compared with an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, decreasing due to the lower revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 1.1% to $26.3 million in 2017 from $26.6 million in 2016, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.5% in 2017 from 27.0% in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in both fixed and variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2017.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $32.6 million in 2015 to $35.6 million in 2016, representing an operating margin of 15.4% in 2016 compared with 13.4% in 2015. Operating earnings improved 9.2% from 2015 to 2016 due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was a decrease in revenues in the U.S. Services segment in 2016 compared with 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Services, partially offset by an increase in revenues in U.S. Contractor Connection. Within U.S. Claims Services, there was a decrease in revenues in U.S. Catastrophe Services discussed below, and a decrease in revenues in our U.S. Claims Field Operations service line due to a decrease in weather-related case volumes in 2016. Revenues were positively impacted in 2016 by segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, which increased by 0.9% over 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 1.3% in 2016 compared with 2015.\nRevenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line include revenues from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, which resulted in $34.9 million of revenues in 2016, compared with $51.3 million in 2015. This decrease represents a 6.8% negative variance in U.S. Services revenue. The services provided to this customer are primarily project-based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, segment revenues and operating earnings would be negatively impacted.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 19.2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2016 compared to 2015.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in both 2016 and 2015. Although there was an overall reduction in revenues, the outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was as 0.9% increase in cases received in U.S. Services in 2016 compared to 2015. This was due to an increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Claims Services cases. The decrease in U.S. Claim Services cases received was primarily due to a decrease in cases in U.S. Claims Field Operations resulting from decreased weather-related activity in 2016 partially offset by increases in U.S. Technical Services and U.S. Catastrophe Services resulting from new clients. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues in either year.\nThe 2016 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the ongoing expansion of our contractor network, the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue, and expansion into adjacent services including consumer segments.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 59.0% for 2016 and 61.8% for 2015. The decrease was due to the impact of certain cost reduction initiatives in 2015 and improved staff utilization.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses decreased from $149.9 million in 2015 to $136.2 million in 2016. There was an average of 1,371 FTEs (including 359 catastrophe adjusters) in 2016 compared with an average of 1,491 FTEs (including 454 catastrophe adjusters) in 2015. The decrease in expenses and FTEs in 2016 was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and a decline in compensation costs and personnel required to service the outsourcing project referred to above.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased from $60.2 million in 2015 to $59.6 million in 2016, although as a percent of segment revenues, increased from 24.8% in 2015 to 25.7% in 2016. The slight decrease in costs was primarily due to the impact of a reduction of office locations in the U.S. and related administrative cost reductions. The increase in expense as a percent of revenues was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings increased to $43.2 million in 2016, an increase of 139.1% from 2015 operating earnings of $18.1 million. The operating margin increased from 3.6% in 2015 to 9.1% in 2016. The increase in operating earnings was the result of improvements in all of our major operating regions and the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\n\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $477.3 million in 2016, compared to $499.9 million in 2015. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $29.4 million, or approximately 5.8%, for 2016 compared with 2015. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International segment revenues would have been $506.6 million in 2016. Overall case volumes in the International segment decreased 12.5% in 2016 compared with 2015. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 13.8% revenue increase for 2016 compared with 2015, due primarily to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases discussed below.\nThe decrease in revenues in the U.K. for 2016 compared with 2015 was due to the change in foreign exchange rates. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, U.K. revenues would have increased, primarily as a result of cases received from flooding in that country during the 2016 first quarter.\nRevenues in Canada increased from 2015 due primarily to an increase from the Fort McMurray wildfires, partially offset by a decrease in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases.\nRevenues increased in Asia-Pacific due to an increase in weather-related activity in Australia, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China where we have exited that product line in those countries.\nThe lower revenues in Europe and Rest of World were due to a reduction in case volumes and changes in the mix of services provided in Scandinavia, the change in foreign exchange rates, and a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil where we have exited that product line in that country.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues increased to $34.4 million in 2016 from $28.6 million in 2015. This increase was due to the increased use of third parties on higher value cases in Europe and Asia-Pacific and in Canada from the Fort McMurray wildfires.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nOverall case volumes were 12.5% lower in 2016 compared with 2015. The U.K. case volumes were higher due primarily to flooding-related cases received in the 2016 first quarter, partially offset by a reduction in high-frequency, low complexity cases. The decrease in Canada cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisal cases in 2016 which offset the increase in cases associated with the Fort McMurray wildfires. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Singapore and China described above. The reduction in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was primarily due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity motor cases in Brazil described above, and a reduction of cases in Scandinavia.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our International segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased from 66.9% in 2015 to 63.7% in 2016. The U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased in 2016 by $30.4 million. These decreases were due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015 and improved staff utilization. There was an average of 4,236 International FTEs in this segment in 2016, a decrease from 4,645 FTEs in the 2015 period.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nAs a component of our acquisition of GAB Robins, the Company acquired a contractor repair business where we are the principal in the relationship with clients. As the principal in this business, both revenues and the corresponding contractor costs are reported at gross values. These contractor expenses are recorded within \"Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" They are reported in this category instead of \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor,\" as the services performed by these outside contractors are not services that can be performed by our workforce.\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 29.5% in 2015 to 27.2% in 2016, and the U.S. dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $17.4 million. The decrease in both amount and percentage is primarily due to cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $30.0 million in 2016, or 9.9% of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings of $24.0 million in 2015, or 8.2% of revenues before reimbursements. Operating earnings improved from 2015 to 2016 due to higher revenues and improved control over operating expenses.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation; for workers' compensation; and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\n\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 3.1% to $302.0 million in 2016 compared with $293.0 million in 2015. The overall increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased claims and medical management revenues as well as higher average case values in 2016.\nRevenues were positively impacted by changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which increased revenues by approximately 3.6% in 2016. This increase was partially offset by unit volumes, measured principally by cases received, which decreased revenues by 0.5% from 2015 to 2016.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.3 million in 2016, increasing slightly from $4.2 million in 2015 due to the growth in revenues.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nOverall, there was a 0.5% decrease in cases received in 2016 compared with 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in Medical Management case referrals, which is reported in the Other category above, partially offset by increases in workers' compensation and casualty cases resulting from new clients.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, increased to 55.4% in 2016 compared with 54.3% in 2015. The amount of these expenses increased from $159.2 million in 2015 to $167.0 million in 2016 due to the growth in revenues. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to an increase in employees and increased incentive compensation. Average FTEs in this segment totaled 1,995 in 2016, up from 1,910 FTEs in 2015. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Global Business Services Center and the increase in work supporting the increased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 34.7% in 2016 from 37.5% in 2015, and the dollar amount of these expenses also decreased by $4.9 million. The decrease in both the amount and the percent of segment revenues was due to a reduction in office expenses, rent and occupancy, and other administrative expenses compared with 2015.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2016 declined compared with the 2015 level primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project. We expect activity on the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project to continue in 2017, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported 2016 operating earnings of $7.2 million, decreasing 41.3% from $12.3 million in 2015, with the related operating margin decreasing from 9.1% in 2015 to 7.3% in 2016. The change in the operating margin was primarily the result of changes in the mix of services provided and the winding down of a major gulf-related special project, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2016.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are derived primarily from legal settlement administration services related to class action settlements, mass tort claims, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 26.8% to $98.7 million in 2016, compared with $134.8 million in 2015. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special project discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $81.0 million, the same as at December 31, 2015. Of the $81.0 million backlog at December 31, 2016, approximately $73.3 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $21.3 million in 2016, decreasing from $30.1 million in 2015. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work in 2016.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased to 65.7% in 2016 compared with 69.0% in 2015. The decrease as a percent of revenues was due to improved employee utilization in 2016. The dollar amount of related expenses declined to $64.8 million in 2016 compared with $93.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues from the special project discussed above. There was an average of 519 FTEs in 2016, compared with an average of 709 FTEs in 2015, decreasing due to the decreased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 9.8% to $26.6 million in 2016 from $29.5 million in 2015, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 27.0% in 2016 from 21.9% in 2015. The dollar amount of these expenses decreased due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues in 2016. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2016.\nEXPENSES AND CREDITS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS\nIncome Taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, changes in tax law, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our various domestic and international operations, which are subject to income taxes at different rates, our ability to utilize loss and tax credit carryforwards, and amounts related to uncertain income tax positions. Income tax provisions totaled $15.0 million, $25.6 million, and $13.8 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company's 2017 effective income tax rate was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. and international restructuring activities. The Company's 2015 effective income tax rate was distortive, primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, our inability to recognize tax benefits for certain international net operating losses, and fluctuations in the mix of income earned. Additionally, 2015 losses in certain operations, including losses due to restructuring and special charges, were in jurisdictions with lower tax rates or where the losses are unable to be benefited. Based on our 2018 operating plans, we anticipate our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes in 2018 to be in the 31% to 33% range before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes to U.S. tax law and policy.\nNet Corporate Interest Expense\nNet corporate interest expense consists of interest expense that we incur on our short- and long-term borrowings, partially offset by interest income we earn on available cash balances and short-term investments. These amounts vary based on interest rates, borrowings outstanding, and the amounts of invested cash. Corporate interest expense totaled $9.9 million, $9.9 million, and $9.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Corporate interest income was relatively consistent in each year, totaling $0.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We pay interest on borrowings under our Credit Facility based on variable rates. Whether we can expect to see future reductions in interest expense compared with prior periods is dependent on the future direction of interest rates as well as the level of outstanding borrowings relative to prior periods.\nStock Option Expense\nStock option expense, a component of stock-based compensation, is comprised of non-cash expenses related to stock options granted under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Stock option expense is not allocated to our operating segments. Stock option expense of $1.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million was recognized during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the 2017 period was due to a higher proportion of options having been granted in 2017 as a component of our Long Term Incentive Plans. Other stock-based compensation expense related to our Executive Stock Bonus Plan and our 2016 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (pursuant to which we have authority to grant performance shares and restricted shares) is charged to our operating segments and included in the determination of segment operating earnings or loss.\nAmortization of Customer-Relationship Intangible Assets\nAmortization of customer-relationship intangible assets represents the non-cash amortization expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled $11.0 million, $9.6 million, and $9.7 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the WeGoLook acquisition. This amortization is included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits\nCertain unallocated costs and credits are excluded from the determination of segment operating earnings. These unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent costs of our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, expenses for our chief executive officer and our Board of Directors, certain adjustments to our self-insured liabilities, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain adjustments and recoveries to our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. From time to time, we evaluate which corporate costs and credits are appropriately allocated to one or more of our operating segments. If changes are made to our allocation methodology, prior period allocations are revised to conform to our then-current allocation methodology.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits were $15.6 million, $24.0 million, and $16.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to a decrease in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, self-insured expenses, and unallocated professional fees. These costs increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to an increase in U.S. defined benefit plan expense, unallocated professional fees, and incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs and self-insured expenses.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nThe Company incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to its Garden City Group reporting unit. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2016. We incurred non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about goodwill impairment charges.\nRestructuring and Special Charges\nTotal restructuring and special charges were $12.1 million for 2017, $9.5 million in 2016, and $34.4 million in 2015. See Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the restructuring and special charges.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Condition\nWe fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Company, its subsidiaries Crawford & Company Risk Services Investments Limited (the \"UK Borrower\"), Crawford & Company (Canada) Inc. (the \"Canadian Borrower\") and Crawford & Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (the \"Australian Borrower\") (the Company, together with such subsidiaries, as borrowers, the \"Borrowers\", Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender (\"Wells Fargo\"), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and a lender, Citizens Bank, N.A., as documentation agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"), which amended and restated that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2011, by and among, inter alia, the Borrowers, Wells Fargo and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (as previously amended, the \"Original Credit Agreement\"). In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company, the Company's guarantor subsidiaries party thereto and Wells Fargo entered into an Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the \"Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement\") and an Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement ( the \"Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement\"), each dated as of the date of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement: (i) increases the aggregate commitments under the Original Credit Agreement from $400.0 million to $450.0 million, without impacting the Company's ability, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and its receipt of additional commitments, to exercise its option to further increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $200.0 million (previously $100.0 million under the Original Credit Agreement); (ii) extends the maturity date under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to November 23, 2022 (the maturity date was November 25, 2018 under the Original Credit Agreement); (iii) reduces the interest margin ranges to 1.30% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans (previously 1.50% to 2.25%) and 0.30% to 1.10% for Base Rate loans (previously 0.50% to 1.25%); (iv) reduces the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio to 1.10 to 1.00 (previously 1.25 to 1.00); and (v) amends the leverage ratio tests to set a maximum permitted senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and set a maximum permitted total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00, among other things.\nThe credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Facility\") consists of a $450.0 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subfacility of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility contains sublimits of $185.0 million for borrowings by the UK Borrower, $75.0 million for borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, and $32.5 million for borrowings by the Australian Borrower. The Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding thereunder, will be due and payable on November 23, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Euros, the currencies of Canada, Japan, Australia or United Kingdom and, subject to the terms of the Credit Facility, other currencies. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the applicable Borrower, based on the Base Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), in each case plus an applicable interest margin based on the Company's leverage ratio (as defined below), provided that borrowings in foreign currencies may bear interest based on LIBOR only. The interest margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 1.30% to 2.10% and for Base Rate loans ranges from 0.30% to 1.10%. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent and (iii) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus 1.0%.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, a total of $224.3 million and $186.2 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition, undrawn commitments under letters of credit totaling $14.5 million and $14.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the letters of credit subfacility of the Credit Facility. These letter of credit commitments were for the Company's own obligations. Including the amounts committed under the letters of credit subfacility, the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $241.3 million and $198.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each existing material domestic subsidiary of the Company, certain other domestic subsidiaries of the Company and certain existing material foreign subsidiaries of the Company that are disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes (each such foreign subsidiary, a \"Disregarded Foreign Entity\"), and such obligations are required to be guaranteed by each subsequently acquired or formed material domestic subsidiary and Disregarded Foreign Entity (each, a \"Guarantor\"), and the obligations of the Borrowers other than the Company (\"Foreign Borrowers\") for which the Company is not the primary obligor are also guaranteed by the Company. In addition, (i) the Borrowers' obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien (subject to liens permitted by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) on substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the Guarantors as set forth in the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement and (ii) the obligations of the Foreign Borrowers are secured by a first priority lien on 100% of the capital stock of the Foreign Borrowers.\nThe representations, covenants and events of default in the Credit Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including required compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio (each as defined below).\nUnder the Credit Facility the fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\") minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nThe leverage ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated EBITDA, must not be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility. If the Company does not meet the covenant requirements in the future, it would be in default under the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the Credit Facility and ancillary documents.\nWe are not aware of any additional restrictions placed on us, or being considered to be placed on us, related to our ability to access capital, such as borrowings under the Credit Facility. We do not rely on repurchase agreements or the commercial paper market to meet our short-term or long-term funding needs. For additional information on the key covenants contained in our Credit Facility, see \"Other Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nWe continue the ongoing monitoring of our customers' ability to pay us for the services that we render to them. Based on historical results, we currently believe there is a low likelihood that write-offs of our existing accounts receivable will have a material impact on our financial results. However, if one or more of our key customers files bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to make required payments to us, or if overall economic conditions deteriorate, we may need to make material provisions in the future to increase our allowance for accounts receivable.\nThe operations of our International segment expose us to a number of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies, as well as the risk of changes in tax rates or tarriffs on earnings or services provided outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with the other functional currencies in certain of the locations in which we do business negatively impacted our revenues and operating earnings in 2017, 2016, and 2015. We cannot predict the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on our future revenues or operating earnings in our International segment.\nAt December 31, 2017, our working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $113.8 million, compared with $134.4 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was due to an increase in short-term borrowings largely to fund the WeGoLook acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 totaled $54.0 million, compared with $81.6 million at the end of 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily related to certain international cash balances being utilized to reduce foreign borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $17.8 million held in the U.S. and $36.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. The Company generally does not provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company's current expectation is that such earnings will be reinvested by the subsidiaries or will be repatriated only when it would be tax effective or otherwise strategically beneficial to the Company, such as if a very unusual event or project generated profits significantly in excess of ongoing business reinvestment needs. If such an event occurs, we would analyze the potential tax impact or our anticipated investment needs in that region and provide for taxes for earnings that are not expected to be permanently reinvested. Other historical earnings and future foreign earnings necessary for business reinvestment are expected to remain permanently reinvested and will be used to provide working capital for these operations, fund defined benefit pension plan obligations, repay non-U.S. debt, fund capital improvements, and fund future acquisitions. We currently believe that funds expected to be generated from our U.S. operations, along with potential borrowing capabilities in the U.S., will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operations and other obligations, including our funding obligations under our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, except in limited circumstances such as those described above, do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our U.S. operations. However, if at a future date or time these funds are necessary for our operations in the U.S. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto, or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition. No additional income or withholding taxes have been provided for any undistributed foreign earnings, other than those subject to the Transition Tax nor have any taxes been provided for outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Additionally, due to withholding tax, basis computations, and other related tax considerations, it is not practicable to estimate any taxes to be provided on outside basis differences at this time. The ultimate tax impact related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretation and assumptions, or issuance of additional guidance issued by the relevant tax authorities and we will continue to refine these estimates and our indefinite reinvestment assertion in accordance with SAB 118.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $58.1 million in 2017, from $98.9 million in 2016 to $40.8 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in accrued incentive compensation, accounts payable, and pension liabilities, and an increase in receivables and prepaid expenses. Interest payments on our debt were $8.4 million in 2017, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $15.6 million in 2017. During the 2016 period the Company settled a cross currency swap for $4.1 million increasing cash from operations for the prior year period.\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $37.2 million in 2016, from $61.7 million in 2015 to $98.9 million in 2016. This increase was largely due to higher net income and a decrease in working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest payments on our debt were $8.5 million in 2016, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $16.2 million in 2016.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities increased by $48.9 million in 2017, from $33.0 million in 2016 to $81.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to $36.0 million for the acquisition of WeGoLook and certain non-compete agreements as discussed in Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses.\" Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $44.9 million in 2017 compared with $29.2 million in 2016. This increase also includes costs incurred for the consolidation and relocation of our Atlanta Support Center as discussed in Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases.\" We forecast that our property and equipment additions in 2018, including capitalized software, will approximate $45 million due to investments required to fund initiatives in our three-year strategic plan.\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $68.2 million in 2016, from $101.2 million in 2015 to $33.0 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to $68.3 million in cash payments for business acquisitions in 2015. Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $29.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.9 million in 2015.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $10.3 million in 2017. In 2017, we borrowed $94.4 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $58.5 million in short-term borrowings and $1.2 million in debt and capital lease obligations. The increase in borrowings in the 2017 period was primarily due to borrowings to fund the WeGoLook acquisition and increased working capital requirements. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.7 million. Also in 2017, we repurchased shares of CRD-A and CRD-B stock totaling $7.4 million, and we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.9 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nCash used by financing activities was $55.2 million in 2016. We borrowed $80.2 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and we repaid a total of $118.0 million in short-term borrowings and $1.5 million in debt and capital lease obligations. We used cash to pay cash dividends totaling $13.6 million. Also in 2016, we received shares of CRD-A stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $1.3 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nOther Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term debt obligations typically peak during the first quarter of each year due to the payment of incentive compensation awards, contributions to retirement plans, and certain other recurring payments, and generally decline during the balance of the year. Our maximum month-end short-term debt obligations were $32.0 million and $23.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our average month-end short-term debt obligations were $8.3 million and $13.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings, excluding outstanding but undrawn letters of credit under our Credit Facility, was $24.6 million and $30 thousand at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The balance in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017 represents amounts under our revolving Credit Facility that we expect, but are not required, to repay in the next twelve months. We have historically used the proceeds from our long-term borrowings to finance, among other things, business acquisitions.\nAs described above, we have two principal financial covenants in our Credit Facility. The leverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio, defined in our Credit Facility as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\"). This ratio must not exceed 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated EBITDA minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all required ratios under our Credit Facility. Based on our financial plans, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with all required covenants throughout 2018. Our compliance with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in our EBITDA, and if our financial plans for 2018 or other future periods do not meet our current projections, we could fail to remain in compliance with these financial covenants in our Credit Facility.\nOur compliance with the leverage ratio covenant is also sensitive to changes in our level of consolidated total funded debt, as defined in our Credit Facility. In addition to short- and long-term borrowings, capital leases, and bank overdrafts, among other things, consolidated total funded debt includes letters of credit, the need for which can fluctuate based on our business requirements. An increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility could negatively impact our leverage ratio, unless those increased borrowings are offset by a corresponding increase in our EBITDA. In addition, a reduction in EBITDA in the future could limit our ability to utilize available credit under the Credit Facility, which could negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nOur compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, which measures our ability to pay certain recurring expenses such as interest and lease payments, is also sensitive to the level of capital expenditures and restricted payments, as defined in our Credit Facility. A decrease in EBITDA could negatively impact our fixed charge coverage ratio, as could increases in our capital expenditures, interest expense, tax expense or restricted payments. If we do not manage those items carefully, we could be in default under the Credit Agreement, which would negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nWe believe our current financial resources, together with funds generated from operations and existing and potential borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to maintain our current operations for the next 12 months.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the impact that our contractual obligations, including estimated interest payments, are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:\n(Note references in the following table refer to the note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\n(1) Assumes principal amounts are repaid at maturity and not refinanced.\nApproximately $17.2 million of operating lease obligations included in the table above are expected to be funded by sublessors under existing sublease agreements. See Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate, based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, in either case plus an applicable margin. Long-term debt refers to the required principal repayment at maturity of the Credit Facility, and may differ significantly from estimates, due to, among other things, actual amounts outstanding at maturity or any refinancings prior to such date. Interest amounts are based on projected borrowings under our Credit Facility and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2017, and the actual interest payments may differ significantly from estimates due to, among other things, changes in outstanding borrowings and prevailing interest rates in the future.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $11.3 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We expect $6.2 million in reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.\nGross deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $51.1 million. This amount is not included in the contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, we believe scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\nDefined Benefit Pension Funding and Cost\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., (the \"U.S. Qualified Plan\") three defined benefit plans in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Plans\"), and defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the Philippines (the \"other international plans\"). Future cash funding of our defined benefit pension plans will depend largely on future investment performance, interest rates, changes to mortality tables, and regulatory requirements. Effective December 31, 2002, we froze our U.S. Qualified Plan. The aggregate deficit in the funded status of the U.S. Plan and other international plans totaled $87.0 million and $105.2 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 decrease in the unfunded deficit of our defined benefit pension plans primarily resulted from the return on plan assets, contributions and adoption of updated mortality tables used to determine U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities. During 2017, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.6 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. In 2016, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $5.1 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. The U.K. Plans were in a funded status totaling $34.7 million and $21.6 million at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the projected benefit obligation. There was a $13.1 million increase during 2017 in the net prepaid pension balances of the U.K. defined benefit plan that is in an overfunded position.\nOur frozen U.S. Qualified Plan was underfunded by $85.8 million at December 31, 2017 based on an accumulated benefit obligation of $474.6 million. Crawford expects to make discretionary contributions of $9.0 million per annum to the U.S. Qualified Plan for the next five fiscal years to improve the funded status of the plan and minimize future required contributions. We estimate that we will make the following annual minimum contributions over the next five years to our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.K. Plans:\n\nFunding requirements are no longer as sensitive to changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the U.S. Qualified plan. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\"BBA2015\") included pension funding reform which greatly reduced the contributions required to the U.S. Qualified Plan. In addition to BBA2015 legislation, pension funding has been governed by rules under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended by the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, and the Highway Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Volatility in the capital markets and future legislation may have a negative impact on our U.S., U.K. and other international pension plans, which may further increase the underfunded portion of our pension plans and our attendant funding obligations. Expected and required contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans will reduce our liquidity, restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to deploy capital to other opportunities.\nCommercial Commitments\nAs a component of our Credit Facility, we maintain a letter of credit facility to satisfy certain contractual obligations. At December 31, 2017, the issued, but undrawn, letters of credit totaled approximately $14.5 million. These letters of credit are typically renewed annually, but unless renewed, will expire as follows:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, which could materially impact our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have certain material obligations under operating lease agreements to which we are a party. In accordance with GAAP, these operating lease obligations and the related leased assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe maintain funds in trusts to administer claims for certain clients. These funds are not available for our general operating activities and, as such, have not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have concluded that we do not have material off-balance sheet financial risk related to these funds at December 31, 2017.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nThe following addresses changes in our financial condition not addressed elsewhere in this MD&A.\nSignificant changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, compared with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, were as follows:\n \u2022 Accounts receivable increased by $20.6 million, or $14.8 million excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange impacts and other adjustments, in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased receivables in U.S. Services related to the hurricane activity and International operations. \n \u2022 Prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets increased by $17.6 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase of $13.1 million in the net prepaid pension balances of the U.K. defined benefit plan that is in a overfunded position. \n \u2022 Noncurrent deferred income tax assets decreased by $5.0 million primarily due to the tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., the adjustments to retirement liabilities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the utilization of foreign tax credits and net operating losses. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis MD&A addresses our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under then-existing circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes in these underlying estimates could potentially materially affect consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of change. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the amounts provided for are based on the best information available to us and we believe these estimates are reasonable.\nWe have discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this MD&A.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of claims processing or program administration fees. Fees for professional services are recognized as unbilled revenues at estimated collectible amounts at the time such services are rendered. Substantially all unbilled revenues are billed within one year. Out-of-pocket costs incurred in administering a claim are typically passed on to our clients and included in our revenues under GAAP. Deferred revenues represent the estimated unearned portion of fees related to future services to be performed under certain fixed-fee service arrangements. Deferred revenues are recognized into revenues based on the estimated rate at which the services are provided. These rates are primarily based on an evaluation of historical claim closing rates by major claim type. Additionally, recent claim closing rates are evaluated to ensure that current claim closing history does not indicate a significant deterioration or improvement in the longer-term historical closing rates used.\nOur fixed-fee service arrangements typically require us to handle claims on either a one- or two-year basis, or for the lifetime of the claim. In cases where we handle a claim on a non-lifetime basis, we typically receive an additional fee on each anniversary date that the claim remains open. For service arrangements where we provide services for the life of the claim, we are only paid one fee for the life of the claim, regardless of the duration of the claim. As a result, our deferred revenues for claims handled for one or two years are not as sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since the revenues are recognized in the near future, and additional fees are generated for handling long-lived claims. Deferred revenues for lifetime claim handling are considered more sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since we are obligated to handle these claims to their conclusion with no additional fees received for long-lived claims. For all fixed fee service arrangements, revenues are recognized over the expected service periods, by type of claim.\nBased upon our historical averages, we close approximately 98% of all cases referred to us under lifetime claim service arrangements within five years from the date of referral. Also, within that five-year period, the percentage of cases remaining open in any one particular year has remained relatively consistent from period to period. Each quarter we evaluate our historical case closing rates by type of claim and make adjustments as necessary. Any changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined.\nAs of December 31, 2017, deferred revenues related to lifetime claim handling arrangements approximated $41.8 million. If the rate at which we close cases changes, the amount of revenues recognized within a period could be affected. In addition, given the competitive environment in which we operate, we may be unable to raise our prices to offset the additional expense associated with handling longer-lived claims should such case closing rates change. The change in our first-year case closing rates over the last ten years has ranged from a decrease of 3.6% to an increase of 4.8%, and has averaged an increase of 0.2%. A 1.0% change is a reasonably likely change in our estimate based on historical data. Absent an increase in per-claim fees from our clients, a 1.0% decrease in claim closing rates for lifetime claims would have resulted in the deferral of additional revenues of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. If our average claim closing rates for lifetime claims increased by 1.0%, we would have recognized additional revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company has contracts with multi-element arrangements. The Company often sells multiple lines of claims processing and different levels of processing depending on the complexity of the claims within a contract. The Company typically provides a menu of offerings from which the customer chooses to purchase or not at their discretion. The price of each service is separate and distinct and provides a separate and distinct value to the customer. Pricing is consistent for each service irrespective of the other service(s) or quantities requested by the customer. For example, if we provide claims processing for auto and general liability, those services are priced and delivered independently.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments and for adjustments to invoiced amounts. Losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments are accounted for as bad debt expense, while adjustments to invoices are accounted for as reductions to revenues. These allowances are established by using historical write-off or adjustment information intended to determine future loss expectations and by considering the current credit worthiness of our clients, any known specific collection problems, and our assessment of current industry conditions. Actual experience may differ significantly from historical or expected loss results. Each quarter, we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in determining these allowances and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $12.6 million and $14.5 million, or approximately 6.7% and 8.6% of gross billed receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to us, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed to be appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 1.0% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other long-lived assets have been impaired. Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets (tangible and intangible) acquired in certain business combinations. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names associated with acquired businesses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing at least annually. When factors indicate that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment between the scheduled annual impairment tests, we perform an interim impairment test. Our other long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, deferred income tax assets, capitalized software, and amortizable intangible assets related to customer relationships, technology, and trade names with finite lives. Other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are identified.\nWe currently have five reporting units for goodwill impairment purposes. These reporting units are our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations, our U.S. Contractor Connection operations on a stand-alone basis, and our other operating segments - International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group.\nIn the annual impairment analysis of goodwill, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair values of those reporting units as determined by a combination of the income approach, specifically discounting future projected cash flows, and the market approach, specifically the Guideline Public Company Method, as described in more detail in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We perform an interim impairment analysis of goodwill when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are based upon certain assumptions made by us. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are reconciled to the Company's total market value as determined by its stock price in order to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed on a reporting unit basis. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The loss recognized cannot subsequently be reversed.\nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the quantitative analysis described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If we conclude that this is the case, we perform the quantitative analysis discussed above.\nThe estimated fair value of our U.S. Contractor Connection operations, International, and Broadspire reporting units exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. The estimated fair value of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit exceeds its carrying value but not by as much of a margin. The U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit has $19.4 million of goodwill at risk of potential future impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 125 basis points could potentially trigger an impairment of our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations reporting unit goodwill, assuming no change in the other key inputs. The Company recognized goodwill impairment charges for the entire goodwill allocated to its Garden City Group reporting unit of $19.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017 due to the reporting unit achieving less than forecasted revenue and operating earnings and based on future expected operating results. We intend to continue to monitor the performance of our reporting units for potential indicators of impairment. If impairment indicators exist, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units utilizing the income approach include the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The discount rates utilized in estimating the fair value of our reporting units in 2017 range between 10.0% and 13.5%, reflecting our assessment of a market participant's view of the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The terminal growth rate used in the analysis was 2.0%. The assumptions used in estimating the fair values are based on currently available data and management's best estimates of revenues and cash flows and, accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names, with carrying values of $29.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, are also evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of potential impairment are identified. Based on our 2017 analysis, we do not believe these trade names are impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test involves estimating the fair value using an internally prepared discounted cash flow analysis. The fair values of the Company's trade names are established using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This method recognizes that, by virtue of owning the trade name as opposed to licensing it, a company or reporting unit is relieved from paying a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of net sales, for the asset's use. The present value of the after-tax costs savings (i.e., royalty relief) at an appropriate discount rate including a tax amortization benefit indicates the value of the trade name. We determined the discount rate based on our performance compared to similar market participants, factored by risk in forecasting using a modified capital asset pricing model.\nThe values of the Broadspire, SLS and WeGoLook trade names are each sensitive to changes in the assumptions used above. The estimated fair value of our Broadspire and SLS trade names exceed their carrying value by a significant margin. An increase in the discount rate by 2.5% could potentially trigger an impairment of the WeGoLook trade name, assuming no changes in the other key inputs. We will continue to monitor the value of these trade names for potential indicators of impairment.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. that cover a substantial number of current and former employees in each location. Certain other employees located in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Philippines have retirement benefits that are accounted for as defined benefit pension plans under GAAP. We utilize the services of independent actuaries to help us estimate our pension obligations and measure pension costs. Our U.S. Qualified Plan was frozen on December 31, 2002. Our U.K. Plans were closed to new employees as of October 31, 1997, but existing participants may still accrue additional limited benefits based on salary levels existing at the close date. Benefits payable under our U.S. Qualified Plan are generally based on career compensation; however, no additional benefits accrue on our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan after December 31, 2002. Benefits payable under the U.K. Plans are generally based on an employee's salary at the time the applicable plan was closed. Our funding policy is to make cash contributions in amounts sufficient to maintain the plans on an actuarially sound basis, but not in excess of amounts deductible under applicable income tax regulations. Note 8, \"Retirement Plans,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides details about the assumptions used in determining the funded status of the plans, the unrecognized actuarial gain/(loss), the components of net periodic benefit cost, benefit payments expected to be made in the future and plan asset allocations.\nInvestment objectives for the Company's U.S. and U.K. pension plan assets are to:\n \u2022 ensure availability of funds for payment of plan benefits as they become due; \n \u2022 provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to volatility, and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power; and \n \u2022 provide investment results that meet or exceed the plans' actuarially assumed long-term rate of return. \nThe long-term goal for the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans is to reach fully-funded status and to maintain that status. The investment policies contemplate the plans' asset return requirements and risk tolerances changing over time. Accordingly, reallocation of the portfolios' mix of return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets will be performed as the plans' funded status improves. In conjunction with our investment policies we have rebalanced the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans' target allocation mix from an equity-weighted to a fixed-income weighted investment strategy, as we have made cash contributions to the plan and the plans' funded status has improved.\nThe rules for pension accounting are complex and the assumptions used can produce volatility in our results, financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the measurement date). Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which are subject to volatility.\nIn addition to expense volatility, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension plans. These adjustments have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and, like our pension expense, are a result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at each measurement date, as well as periodic changes to mortality tables used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. The funded status of our plans may also impact our liquidity, as changes to funding laws in the U.S. may require higher funding levels for our pension plans.\nThe principal assumptions used in accounting for our defined benefit pension plans are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, and the mortality expectations for plan participants. The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Our discount rates were determined with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. At December 31, 2017, the discount rate used to compute the benefit obligations of the U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans were 3.63% and 2.61%, respectively.\nThe estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in collective funds. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities as described above.\nEstablishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:\n \u2022 the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets; \n \u2022 the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time; and \n \u2022 the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. \nWe review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. As a result of the transition to a liability-driven investment strategy described previously, the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption used to determine 2018 net periodic pension cost were estimated to be 6.20% and 3.85% for the U.S. and U.K. plans, respectively.\nWe review our employee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary. During 2017, we revised the mortality assumptions for the U.S. plans to incorporate the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect Company-specific experience and future expectations. This resulted in a $3.2 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. plans.\nPension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the calculated value method. The amounts recognized in the balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date and the effect of mark-to-market accounting on plan assets. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an increase to equity through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") of $0.7 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2017. At December 31, 2016, we recorded an increase to equity through OCI of $11.3 million (net of tax at the applicable jurisdictional rate) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2016. Those changes are subject to amortization over future years and may be reflected in future income statements.\nCumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for all plans were $268.5 million through December 31, 2017, compared with $280.0 million through December 31, 2016. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the discount rates, differences between expected and actual asset returns, and changes to mortality expectations for plan participants, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless the minimum amount required to be amortized is below a corridor amount equal to 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future periods. For example, projected pension plan expense for 2018 includes $10.3 million of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $11.2 million in 2017, $12.8 million in 2016 and $13.4 million in 2015.\nNet periodic pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions for the expected rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans. If our assumptions for the expected returns on plan assets of our U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans changed by 0.5%, representing either an increase or decrease in expected returns, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $3.3 million. If our assumptions for the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans changed by 0.25%, representing either an increase or decrease in interest rates used to value pension plan liabilities, the impact to 2017 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $0.8 million.\nBeginning with the December 31, 2016 measurement, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for U.S. and international pension and other postretirement benefits. This new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. Historically, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.\nWe made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. While the benefit obligation measured under this approach is unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates reduced the service and interest cost for the pension plans for fiscal 2017 by $3.2 million. We do not expect this change will have a material effect in periods beyond 2017. For the pension plans, the weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs were 3.23% for the Company's U.S. plans and 2.66% for the U.K. plans.\nDetermination of Effective Tax Rate Used for Financial Reporting\nWe account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred taxes are made in recognition of these temporary differences. The most significant differences relate to revenue recognition, accrued compensation and pensions, self-insurance, and depreciation and amortization.\nFor financial reporting purposes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to our income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our consolidated balance sheets that are not related to balances in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon changes between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for income tax purposes, multiplied by the enacted statutory tax rates for the year in which we estimate these differences will reverse. We must estimate the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, as well as whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nOther factors which influence our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes include changes in enacted statutory tax rates, changes in tax law or policy, changes in the composition of taxable income from the countries in which we operate, our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nOur effective tax rate, defined as our provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, for financial reporting purposes in 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 35.6%, 40.4%, and (43.5)%, respectively. If our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes changed by 1.0%, we would have recognized an increase or decrease to income taxes of approximately $421,000, $635,000, and $316,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes is expected to range between 31% and 33% in 2018 before considering any discrete items and assuming no changes in tax law or policy.\nIt is possible that future changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate, including but not limited to changes in tax law or policy, could have a significant impact on U.S.-based multinational companies such as our Company. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood or details of any such changes or their specific potential impact on our Company.\nOur most significant deferred tax assets are related to the unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans, tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards. The tax deduction for defined benefit pension plans generally occurs upon funding of plan liabilities. Assuming that the estimated minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and the income projections are met, the deferred tax asset should be realized.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we have considered the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards and have an $18.8 million valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in our international and domestic operations. For our remaining deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets based on our forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that are available to the Company. Future changes in the valuation allowance, if required, should not affect our liquidity or our compliance with any existing debt covenants.\nOur tax credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded a valuation allowance primarily consist of $22.0 million of foreign tax credit (\"FTC\") carryforwards, which materially expire in 2020. Companies that cannot credit all the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid in a particular tax year because their foreign taxes exceed their FTC limitation are allowed to carry their excess taxes back to the preceding tax year and then forward to the ten succeeding years. Utilization of our FTCs is dependent upon sufficient U.S. regular taxable income and foreign source income in the relevant foreign tax credit basket which is impacted by the interaction of overall domestic and overall foreign loss rules. Based on our projections of income through 2020, including the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., we expect to fully utilize the FTC carryforwards before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the FTC carryforwards will be utilized.\nThe NOL carryforwards for which a valuation allowance is not recorded primarily consists of $11.4 million of U.K. NOL carryforwards and $8.0 million of state NOL carryforwards generated by our domestic companies.\nIn the U.K., NOL carryforwards have an unlimited life. Based on our evaluation of sources of taxable income, we expect to fully utilize the U.K. NOL carryforwards. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we should be able to utilize our U.K. NOL carryforwards.\nIn order to fully utilize these state NOL carryforwards, our domestic operations must generate taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards. Based on our projections of income, the Company expects to fully utilize its state NOL carryforwards in the majority of jurisdictions before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards for these jurisdictions. There are certain states with unique rules that result in the Company not expecting to utilize the state NOL carryforwards before expiration. For those jurisdictions, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards and a valuation allowance was recorded. The valuation allowance against state NOL carryforwards was $0.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe remaining NOL carryforwards were generated by certain foreign jurisdictions and are generally offset by full valuation allowances.\nSelf-Insured Risks\nWe self-insure certain insurable risks consisting primarily of professional liability, auto liability, employee medical, disability, and workers' compensation. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures, including professional liability on a claims-made basis, and those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Most of these self-insured risks are in the U.S. Provisions for claims incurred under self-insured programs are made based on our estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred, including estimated legal fees, losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us, and the adverse developments on reported losses. These estimated liabilities are calculated based on historical claim payment experience, the expected life of the claims, and other factors considered relevant to the claims. The liabilities for claims incurred under our self-insured workers' compensation and employee disability programs are discounted at the prevailing risk-free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration. All other self-insured liabilities are undiscounted. Each quarter we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in developing these estimated liabilities and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our estimated liabilities for self-insured risks totaled $22.9 million and $26.3 million, respectively. The estimated liability is most sensitive to changes in the ultimate liability for a claim and, if applicable, the interest rate used to discount the liability. We believe our provisions for self-insured losses are adequate to cover the expected cost of losses incurred, net of insurance recoveries. However, these provisions are estimates and amounts ultimately settled may be significantly greater or less than the provisions established. We used a discount rate of 2.05% to determine the present value of our self-insured workers' compensation liabilities as of December 31, 2017. If the average discount rate was reduced by 1.0% or increased by 1.0%, reflecting either an increase or decrease in underlying interest rates, our estimated liabilities for these self-insured risks at December 31, 2017 would have been impacted by approximately $529,000, resulting in an increase or decrease to 2017 consolidated net income of approximately $329,000.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee
