Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe information in this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results, causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" above for further information. Also, when we cross reference to a \"Note,\" we are referring to our \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\" unless the context indicates otherwise. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.\nUnder the SEC's amended definition of a \"smaller reporting company,\" the Company is deemed to be a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, among other things, the Company is not required to present selected financial data in Item 6 and has reduced the number of years covered by its financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.\nWe operate through three product group segments, in addition to a Corporate segment. In 2019, 35% of the Company's revenues were derived from Cinch Connectivity Solutions, 33% from Power Solutions and Protection and 32% from its Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nOur operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.\nWe have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.\nKey Factors Affecting our Business\nThe Company believes the key factors affecting Bel's 2019 and/or future results include the following:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenues - The Company's revenues declined by $55.8 million, or 10.2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. By product segment, Power Solutions and Protection sales were down by 7.3%, Cinch Connectivity Solutions sales declined by 7.7% and Magnetic Solutions sales were lower by 15.4%. International trade policy, and in particular the additional tariffs imposed on our products imported from China, negatively impacted our sales volumes in 2019. Following an acceleration of orders throughout 2018 from customers anticipating higher pricing in 2019, the industry experienced lower order and sales volumes throughout the supply chain in 2019. In many cases for Bel, the lower order volume related to customers and distributors working through their inventory on hand. However, by year end, the ongoing tariffs caused certain customers to source products from other countries and this further impacted our sales beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Backlog - Our backlog of orders totaled $160.2 million at December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $10.9 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2018. Since the 2018 year-end, we saw a 21% increase at Cinch Connectivity Solutions, driven by higher demand related to a variety of military applications. The backlog for our Power Solutions and Protection products decreased by 14%, driven by certain customers sourcing product elsewhere in light of the ongoing tariffs on our product manufactured in China. Further, several of our OEM customers and distribution partners continued to work through inventory on hand through the remainder of 2019, and did not yet place replenishment orders prior to year-end. Our Magnetic Solutions backlog declined by 29%, as one of our large OEM end customers had ordered high volumes at the start of a new product launch in 2018 and worked through inventory on hand throughout 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Product Mix - Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company's gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel's profit margins. See Note 12, \"Segments\" for profit margin information by product group.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Pricing and Availability of Materials - There have been recent supply constraints related to components that constitute raw materials in our manufacturing processes, particularly with resistors, capacitors, mosfets and printed circuit boards. Lead times were extended and the reduction in supply also caused an increase in prices for certain of these components throughout 2018. As a result, the Company's material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 44.7% during 2019 from 41.9% during 2018. Purchases of raw materials during 2019 were at lower pricing though still elevated compared to pre-2018 pricing. As we've worked through much of our higher cost inventory on hand from 2018, we anticipate our material costs as a percentage of sales will be lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Labor Costs - Labor costs decreased from 11.5% of sales during 2018 to 10.3% of sales during 2019, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Renminbi, particularly during the first half of 2019. The favorable impact of exchange rates was partially offset by minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. We anticipate labor costs will be a challenge in the early part of 2020 as we expect to incur labor costs in the PRC for associates who are unable to return to work following the extended Lunar New Year holiday due to travel restrictions or illness in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. The preceding two sentences represent a Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Restructuring - The Company continues to implement restructuring programs to increase operational efficiencies and incurred $2.6 million in restructuring costs during 2019. Throughout 2019, we transitioned our Signal manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, closed our office in Shanghai, and implemented other indirect headcount reductions globally. These actions resulted in total annualized cost savings of $5.7 million ($3.4 million in cost of sales, $1.8 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). Of the annualized cost savings, $1.7 million was realized in 2019 with the incremental $4.0 million to be realized in 2020 ($2.6 million in cost of sales, $0.9 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). The Company will continue to streamline the organization in 2020 to further improve profitability. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Impact of Foreign Currency - During 2019, favorable fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi, resulted in lower labor and overhead costs of $4.2 million versus the exchange rates in effect during 2018. In addition, a foreign exchange transactional gain of $0.1 million was realized during 2019. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The Company has significant manufacturing operations located in the PRC where labor and overhead costs are paid in local currency. As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $4.2 million lower in 2019. The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and may implement pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its consolidated operating results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> ERP System Implementation - In January 2019, the Company completed the first phase of its ERP system implementation with the successful transition of its Power Solutions business onto the new system without any notable issues. In January 2020, the second phase of the implementation related to its TRP business was completed successfully. The Company incurred expenses of $1.8 million during 2019 related to this project. The remaining phases of this project will largely leverage Bel's trained internal resources which should result in lower implementation costs going forward. In 2019, the Company realized cost savings of $2.0 million related to the elimination of redundant license fees associated with its ERP systems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Coronavirus Outbreak - Bel is closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its impact on our operations and supply channel. We anticipate first quarter 2020 results will be impacted by the extended Lunar New Year holiday break and by lower productivity levels at our four manufacturing sites in China, all of which have resumed operations at reduced levels. Our top priority is the welfare of our associates, and we are working diligently with the local governmental authorities to ensure necessary preparations are made to allow our remaining associates to safely return to work. Lead times for our products are currently pushed back by four weeks, and may extend further as we better determine the impact on our suppliers. Logistics companies and customs offices are also operating at reduced levels. As of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the level of financial impact that the Coronavirus will have on our 2020 consolidated financial results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Regulatory Approvals - Bel's Cinch Connectivity Solutions segment is a supplier to a large U.S. commercial aerospace customer and has content on a model of aircraft that is currently grounded. We anticipate, at a minimum, sales to be unfavorably impacted by $5-$7 million throughout the first half of 2020, with an earnings impact of approximately $2.5-$3.0 million. This impact is an estimate for the first half of 2020 only, and we anticipate a similar impact in future quarters for as long as the grounding continues. The preceding two sentences represent Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Effective Tax Rate - The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic region in which the pretax profits are earned.

See Note 9 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Income Taxes\".\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe enter 2020 with very limited visibility given the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in China and separately, the grounding of aircraft at a large commercial aerospace customer. Bel management is closely monitoring both of these situations, and working diligently to minimize the impacts to our operations and financial results.\nSummary by Operating Segment\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales by major product line for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Gross Profit %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Magnetic solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power solutions and protection\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCinch Connectivity Solutions:\nOur connectivity solutions products showed a reduction in sales of $14.4 million during 2019 compared to 2018. Sales of our Stewart passive connectors were down by $8.4 million from 2018 primarily due to reduced volume of product flowing through out distribution channels as our distribution partners continued to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. In addition, weakened economic conditions in the construction industry in the U.S. and Europe impacted demand for our product in premise wiring applications. Sales of our Cinch products were lower by $5.9 million in 2019 primarily related to lower demand from military and commercial aerospace customers compared to 2018. The decline in Cinch Connectivity Solutions gross profit margins during 2019 related to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower sales and higher direct and indirect labor costs, particularly in Mexico where the minimum wage rates increased significantly effective January 1, 2019.\nMagnetic Solutions:\nSales of our magnetic products declined by $28.9 million from 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 were worked through. While orders received for our magnetic products in 2019 were down by $53.0 million from 2018 levels, we saw our first indication of recovery in the fourth quarter of 2019, with an increase in bookings of $3.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in Magnetic Solutions gross profit margin from 2018 primarily resulted from the decline in sales, which led to lower absorption of fixed costs within the factories. Higher material costs within this product group were offset by lower labor costs driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Renminbi in 2019 as compared to the exchange rates in place throughout 2018.\nPower Solutions and Protection:\nSales of our Power Solutions products declined by $12.5 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products decreased by $11.2 million, the impact of which was largely seen in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Limitations and additional tariffs related to U.S.-China trade accounted for $6.6 million of the decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, with the balance of the decline relating to lower orders in 2019 as our customers and distribution partners worked through their inventory on hand from 2018. Sales of our circuit protection and custom module products were also lower during 2019 by $1.7 million and $1.5 million from 2018, respectively. These declines were partially offset by revenue from our acquisition of the CUI power assets in December 2019, which contributed $2.2 million of sales during 2019. The reduction in gross profit margin for the Power Solutions and Protection segment primarily related to higher material costs on product shipped during 2019. This was partially offset by lower fixed costs at the factories, with reductions in support labor and fringe of $0.9 million, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million, and a decline in overhead costs of $0.9 million.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the two years ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Labor costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaterial costs as a percentage of sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components throughout much of 2018, which led to higher raw material prices. The higher-cost raw materials purchased in 2018 were components to a large portion of the finished goods sold throughout 2019. This has had an unfavorable impact on gross margins across most of our product lines.\nLabor costs as a percentage of sales declined in 2019 compared to 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel's factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019.\nThe other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities and insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during 2019 by $5.3 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower support labor and fringe expense of $3.0 million, a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.4 million and lower overhead expenses of $0.5 million.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expenses were $26.9 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduction in R&D expenses during 2019 largely resulted from restructuring efforts during the year, in addition to a favorable impact of the depreciation of the Euro, Pound and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A expenses were $76.1 million in 2019 as compared with $82.6 million in 2018. The reduction primarily related to a lower fringe benefit expense of $2.8 million, a reduction in legal and professional fees of $2.4 million (largely due to elimination of redundant ERP license and support fees), lower sales commissions of $0.7 million and a reduction in G&A headcount resulting in $0.6 million of lower salaries.\nRestructuring Charges\nThe Company recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million in 2019 in connection with the transition of its manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, the closure of its office in Shanghai and indirect headcount reductions in Europe and Asia, largely related to our Power segment. The Company recorded $0.2 million of restructuring charges in 2018 related to the closure of its manufacturing facility in Malaysia.\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred interest expense of $5.4 million in 2019 and $5.3 million in 2018 primarily due to our outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit and security agreement used to fund the 2014 Acquisitions. The slight increase in interest expense during 2019 related to higher interest rates on our outstanding balance during 2019, partially offset by a lower debt balance throughout most of 2019 as compared to 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Debt,\" for further information on the Company's outstanding debt.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net was expense of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to income of $2.0 million in 2018. The expense in 2019 largely related to a $2.1 million loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries. Another factor attributable to the year over year variance was a foreign exchange gain of $2.7 million in 2018 as compared to a foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographic regions. See Note 9, Income Taxes\u201d and the Tax Reform\u201d discussion below.\nTax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, we had made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in which we recognized a provisional amount of $18.1 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. On the basis of revised E&P computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a measurement-period adjustment reducing the deemed repatriation tax by $2.6 million, resulting in the reduction of the Company's provisional estimate from $18.1 million to $15.5 million. The effect of the measurement-period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate was a reduction of approximately 11%. The Company plans to pay the transition tax in installments in accordance with the Act.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected an accounting policy to provide for the tax expense related to the GILTI in the period the tax is incurred. The Company included approximately $6.8 million and $18.0 million of GILTI inclusion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The GILTI income was offset by the Company's U.S. losses and credits which resulted in no additional U.S. tax expense.\n2019 as Compared to 2018\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company's earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $30.9 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in income in the Asia and North America regions. The Company's effective tax rate was (19.7%) and 12.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and permanent tax differences on U.S. tax exempt activities. Additionally, the effective tax rate of 2018 was favorably impacted by a measurement period adjustment of $2.6 million related to the transition tax.\nOther Tax Matters\nThe Company has a portion of its products manufactured on the mainland of the PRC where Bel is not subject to corporate income tax on manufacturing services provided by third parties. Hong Kong has a territorial tax system which imposes corporate income tax at a rate of 16.5% on income from activities solely conducted in Hong Kong.\nThe Company holds an offshore business license from the government of Macao. With this license, a Macao offshore company named Bel Fuse (Macao Commercial Offshore) Limited has been established to handle the Company's sales to third-party customers in Asia. Sales by this company primarily consist of products manufactured in the PRC. This company is not subject to Macao corporate profit taxes which are imposed at a tax rate of 12%. As part of Macau's commitment to comply with OECD standards, it will abolish the existing offshore company (MOC) regime as of January 1, 2021. The existing law and the relevant regulations related to the offshore business will be abolished and the operating permit to carry on offshore business will be terminated on January 1, 2021. The Company has decided to continue this company's operations and beginning January 1, 2021 will pay 12% tax on any profits from this operation.\nManagement has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Applicable income and dividend withholding taxes have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to the practicality of determining the deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries, we have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences and deemed that these basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested.\nInflation and Foreign Currency Exchange\nDuring the past two years, we do not believe the effect of inflation was material to our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected our foreign operations as most sales continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars or currencies directly or indirectly linked to the U.S. dollar. Most significant expenses, including raw materials, labor and manufacturing expenses, are incurred primarily in U.S. dollars or the Chinese Renminbi, and to a lesser extent in British pounds and Mexican pesos. The Chinese Renminbi depreciated by approximately 4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the British pound depreciated by 4%. The Mexican peso did not have a material fluctuation on average in 2019 as compared to 2018. To the extent the Renminbi or Peso appreciate in future periods, it could result in the Company's incurring higher costs for most expenses incurred in the PRC and Mexico. The Company's European entities, whose functional currencies are Euros, British pounds and Czech Korunas, enter into transactions which include sales that are denominated principally in euros, British pounds and various other European currencies, and purchases that are denominated principally in U.S. dollars and British pounds. Such transactions, as well as those related to our multi-currency intercompany payable and receivable transactions, resulted in net realized and unrealized currency exchange (losses) gains of ($0.1) million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were included in other income/expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The currency exchange gains recorded in 2018 were primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and Euro against the U.S. dollar. Translation of subsidiaries' foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in translation adjustments, net of taxes, of $2.6 million and ($6.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, $29.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 40% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company. During 2019, the Company repatriated $29.3 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability. We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company's U.S. operations in the future. In the event these funds were needed for Bel's U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.\nIn June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in December 2014, March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017 (see Note 10, \"Debt,\" for additional details). The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined (\"Leverage Ratio\"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges (\"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\"). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. On February 18, 2020, the Company further amended its credit agreement whereby the Company voluntarily prepaid a portion of its term loan under the Credit Agreement in the amount of $8.2 million. The Amendment also served to modify the interest rate and fees applicable to the loans under the credit agreement and changes certain covenants related to matters including acquisitions, share repurchases and financial ratios.\nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2019, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at December 31, 2019 was $43.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $19.9 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $145.0 million outstanding under its credit agreement. Scheduled principal payments of the long-term debt outstanding are included in \"Contractual Obligations\" below and in Note 10, \"Debt.\"\nFor information regarding further commitments under the Company's operating leases, see Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global Enterprise Resource Planning system ( ERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP is being conducted by business units on a three-phase approach through early 2021. Since inception of the project, we have incurred costs in a cumulative amount of $7.0 million in connection with this implementation, of which $1.8 million and $2.2 million in implementation costs was incurred during 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are included in SG&A on the consolidated financial statements. The first phase of the ERP implementation project was completed in the first quarter of 2019 with the Power Solutions business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2019. The second phase of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2020 with the TRP business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2020. To date, 40% of our overall business has transitioned to the new ERP system and we've achieved annual cost savings on ERP licensing fees of approximately $2 million within SG&A expense which were largely realized in 2019. We anticipate completing this project with in-house resources by early 2021, with no further outside consulting costs. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.4 million. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $24.5 million and $32.0 million of net proceeds from borrowing under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by a $29.0 million payment, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of the CUI power assets, the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $9.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $3.0 million, and payments of $3.4 million for dividends. Cash provided by operations increased by $14.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $15.4 million. This decline was primarily due to the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $11.6 million, repayments of long-term debt of $9.0 million, the acquisition of BCMZ for $2.2 million, and payments of $3.3 million for dividends. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $10.1 million. Cash provided by operations decreased by $14.0 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 31.6% and 32.9% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, accounts receivable decreased $19.3 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased slightly to 60 days at December 31, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories decreased by $17.1 million from the December 31, 2018 level as raw material levels were lower in response to a decrease in customer demand for our products. Inventory turns decreased slightly to 3.6 times per year at December 31, 2019 from 3.7 times per year at December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth at December 31, 2019 the amounts of payments due under specific types of contractual obligations, aggregated by category of contractual obligation, for the time periods described below.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments due on long-term debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditure obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transition tax payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Raw material purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First quarter 2020 quarterly cash dividend declared\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> Represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> Includes interest payments required under our CSA related to our term loans and revolver balance.

At December 31, 2019, we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 9, \"Income Taxes,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company is required to pay SERP obligations at the occurrence of certain events. As of December 31, 2019, $21.5 million is included in long-term liabilities as an unfunded pension obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Included in other assets at December 31, 2019 is the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust with an aggregate value of $14.7 million, which has been designated by the Company to be utilized to fund the Company's SERP obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Other Matters\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as current fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as provisions related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, investments, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including in some cases future projections, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies require accounting estimates that have the potential for significantly impacting Bel's financial statements.\nInventory\nThe Company makes purchasing and manufacturing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers, projected customer requirements and the availability and pricing of raw materials. Future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the Company's operations include miscalculating customer requirements, technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete, loss of customers and/or cancellation of sales orders, stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements. The Company reduces the carrying value of its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on the aforementioned assumptions. When such inventory is subsequently used in the manufacturing process, the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales and the improved gross profit is recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had reserves for excess or obsolete inventory of $9.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.\nA reporting unit is the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at businesses one level below that operating segment, the \"component\" level, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.\nWhile we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, we performed quantitative tests for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated.\nThe goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.\nWe use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non-cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and an appropriate market approach, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit's fair value.\nFair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods.\nIncome Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nThe income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt-free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market-derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit's expected long-term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long-term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt-free working capital.\n2019 Goodwill Impairment Tests\nAs further discussed in Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", due to weakened market conditions, the Company performed interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. Further, based on management's view of the Company, there was a change in reportable operating segments effective October 1, 2019. At the Company's annual test date for goodwill impairment, an analysis was performed on both the one remaining former segment with goodwill and the new segments to ensure that no impairment existed as of the annual test date under either set of segments. Critical assumptions that the Company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units at each test date throughout 2019 included the following:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Applying a compounded annual growth rate for forecasted sales in our projected cash flows through 2024.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Segment Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Test Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Normalized Growth Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Applying a terminal value growth rate of 2% for our reporting units to reflect our estimate of stable and perpetual growth.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> Determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to our projected cash flow results.

Our forecasts take into account the near and long-term expected business performance, considering the long-term market conditions and business trends within the reporting units. For further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see \"Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nMarket Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nEach year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value.\nThe market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit's operating performance (the \"Public Company Method\"). These multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company (the \"Quoted Price Method\"). The third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publicly-traded and privately-held companies in our industries (the \"Mergers and Acquisition Method\").\nThe key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12-month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under the Public Company and Quoted Price Methods, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions.\nWe applied a combined weighting of 25% to the market approach when determining the fair value of these reporting units.\nIf our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock, a decline in current market multiples, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, heightened competition, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of), we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at that time. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its goodwill exceeded the associated carrying value at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment exists as of that date. See Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2019.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy or significant declines in our stock price, indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company annually tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on October 1, using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). The Company conducted an interim impairment test as of July 31, 2019 and subsequently, its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at either testing date. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its trademarks exceeds the associated carrying values at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment existed as of that date. At December 31, 2019, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets related solely to trademarks.\nLong-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company depreciates its property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Management reviews long-lived assets and other intangible assets for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related net book value. No material impairments related to long-lived assets or amortized intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such asset. In the ordinary course of a global business, the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain for many transactions. It is the Company's policy not to recognize tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions that may not be realized in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes the provisions based upon management's assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically (at least quarterly) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. The accounting literature requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and, consequently, affect our operating results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standards further described in Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that more closely aligns revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Management believes that the loss of this individual customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had sales of $50.2 million to Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group, representing 10.2% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Sales to this customer are primarily in the Company's Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nOther Matters\nThe Company believes that it has sufficient cash reserves to fund its foreseeable working capital needs. It may, however, seek to expand such resources through bank borrowings, at favorable lending rates, from time to time. If the Company were to undertake another substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or would be financed in part through cash on hand and in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. If the Company borrows additional money to finance acquisitions, this would further decrease the Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, and could further impact the Company's material restrictive covenants, depending on the size of the borrowing and the nature of the target company. Under its existing credit facility, the Company is required to obtain its lender's consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and may be restricted from paying cash dividends on its common stock. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the Company cannot assure investors that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If the Company issues a substantial amount of stock either as consideration in an acquisition or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over its existing common stock.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.\nUnder the SEC's amended definition of a \"smaller reporting company,\" the Company is deemed to be a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, among other things, the Company is not required to present selected financial data in Item 6 and has reduced the number of years covered by its financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.\nWe operate through three product group segments, in addition to a Corporate segment. In 2019, 35% of the Company's revenues were derived from Cinch Connectivity Solutions, 33% from Power Solutions and Protection and 32% from its Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nOur operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.\nWe have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.\nKey Factors Affecting our Business\nThe Company believes the key factors affecting Bel's 2019 and/or future results include the following:\n \u2022 Revenues - The Company's revenues declined by $55.8 million, or 10.2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. By product segment, Power Solutions and Protection sales were down by 7.3%, Cinch Connectivity Solutions sales declined by 7.7% and Magnetic Solutions sales were lower by 15.4%. International trade policy, and in particular the additional tariffs imposed on our products imported from China, negatively impacted our sales volumes in 2019. Following an acceleration of orders throughout 2018 from customers anticipating higher pricing in 2019, the industry experienced lower order and sales volumes throughout the supply chain in 2019. In many cases for Bel, the lower order volume related to customers and distributors working through their inventory on hand. However, by year end, the ongoing tariffs caused certain customers to source products from other countries and this further impacted our sales beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \u2022 Backlog - Our backlog of orders totaled $160.2 million at December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $10.9 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2018. Since the 2018 year-end, we saw a 21% increase at Cinch Connectivity Solutions, driven by higher demand related to a variety of military applications. The backlog for our Power Solutions and Protection products decreased by 14%, driven by certain customers sourcing product elsewhere in light of the ongoing tariffs on our product manufactured in China. Further, several of our OEM customers and distribution partners continued to work through inventory on hand through the remainder of 2019, and did not yet place replenishment orders prior to year-end. Our Magnetic Solutions backlog declined by 29%, as one of our large OEM end customers had ordered high volumes at the start of a new product launch in 2018 and worked through inventory on hand throughout 2019. \n \u2022 Product Mix - Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company's gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel's profit margins. See Note 12, \"Segments\" for profit margin information by product group. \n \u2022 Pricing and Availability of Materials - There have been recent supply constraints related to components that constitute raw materials in our manufacturing processes, particularly with resistors, capacitors, mosfets and printed circuit boards. Lead times were extended and the reduction in supply also caused an increase in prices for certain of these components throughout 2018. As a result, the Company's material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 44.7% during 2019 from 41.9% during 2018. Purchases of raw materials during 2019 were at lower pricing though still elevated compared to pre-2018 pricing. As we've worked through much of our higher cost inventory on hand from 2018, we anticipate our material costs as a percentage of sales will be lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Labor Costs - Labor costs decreased from 11.5% of sales during 2018 to 10.3% of sales during 2019, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Renminbi, particularly during the first half of 2019. The favorable impact of exchange rates was partially offset by minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. We anticipate labor costs will be a challenge in the early part of 2020 as we expect to incur labor costs in the PRC for associates who are unable to return to work following the extended Lunar New Year holiday due to travel restrictions or illness in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. The preceding two sentences represent a Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Restructuring - The Company continues to implement restructuring programs to increase operational efficiencies and incurred $2.6 million in restructuring costs during 2019. Throughout 2019, we transitioned our Signal manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, closed our office in Shanghai, and implemented other indirect headcount reductions globally. These actions resulted in total annualized cost savings of $5.7 million ($3.4 million in cost of sales, $1.8 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). Of the annualized cost savings, $1.7 million was realized in 2019 with the incremental $4.0 million to be realized in 2020 ($2.6 million in cost of sales, $0.9 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). The Company will continue to streamline the organization in 2020 to further improve profitability. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Impact of Foreign Currency - During 2019, favorable fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi, resulted in lower labor and overhead costs of $4.2 million versus the exchange rates in effect during 2018. In addition, a foreign exchange transactional gain of $0.1 million was realized during 2019. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The Company has significant manufacturing operations located in the PRC where labor and overhead costs are paid in local currency. As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $4.2 million lower in 2019. The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and may implement pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its consolidated operating results. \n \u2022 ERP System Implementation - In January 2019, the Company completed the first phase of its ERP system implementation with the successful transition of its Power Solutions business onto the new system without any notable issues. In January 2020, the second phase of the implementation related to its TRP business was completed successfully. The Company incurred expenses of $1.8 million during 2019 related to this project. The remaining phases of this project will largely leverage Bel's trained internal resources which should result in lower implementation costs going forward. In 2019, the Company realized cost savings of $2.0 million related to the elimination of redundant license fees associated with its ERP systems. \n \u2022 Coronavirus Outbreak - Bel is closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its impact on our operations and supply channel. We anticipate first quarter 2020 results will be impacted by the extended Lunar New Year holiday break and by lower productivity levels at our four manufacturing sites in China, all of which have resumed operations at reduced levels. Our top priority is the welfare of our associates, and we are working diligently with the local governmental authorities to ensure necessary preparations are made to allow our remaining associates to safely return to work. Lead times for our products are currently pushed back by four weeks, and may extend further as we better determine the impact on our suppliers. Logistics companies and customs offices are also operating at reduced levels. As of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the level of financial impact that the Coronavirus will have on our 2020 consolidated financial results. \n \u2022 Regulatory Approvals - Bel's Cinch Connectivity Solutions segment is a supplier to a large U.S. commercial aerospace customer and has content on a model of aircraft that is currently grounded. We anticipate, at a minimum, sales to be unfavorably impacted by $5-$7 million throughout the first half of 2020, with an earnings impact of approximately $2.5-$3.0 million. This impact is an estimate for the first half of 2020 only, and we anticipate a similar impact in future quarters for as long as the grounding continues. The preceding two sentences represent Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Effective Tax Rate - The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic region in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographic regions. See Note 9 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Income Taxes\". \nWe enter 2020 with very limited visibility given the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in China and separately, the grounding of aircraft at a large commercial aerospace customer. Bel management is closely monitoring both of these situations, and working diligently to minimize the impacts to our operations and financial results.\nSummary by Operating Segment\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales by major product line for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Gross Profit %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Magnetic solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power solutions and protection\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCinch Connectivity Solutions:\nOur connectivity solutions products showed a reduction in sales of $14.4 million during 2019 compared to 2018. Sales of our Stewart passive connectors were down by $8.4 million from 2018 primarily due to reduced volume of product flowing through out distribution channels as our distribution partners continued to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. In addition, weakened economic conditions in the construction industry in the U.S. and Europe impacted demand for our product in premise wiring applications. Sales of our Cinch products were lower by $5.9 million in 2019 primarily related to lower demand from military and commercial aerospace customers compared to 2018. The decline in Cinch Connectivity Solutions gross profit margins during 2019 related to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower sales and higher direct and indirect labor costs, particularly in Mexico where the minimum wage rates increased significantly effective January 1, 2019.\nMagnetic Solutions:\nSales of our magnetic products declined by $28.9 million from 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 were worked through. While orders received for our magnetic products in 2019 were down by $53.0 million from 2018 levels, we saw our first indication of recovery in the fourth quarter of 2019, with an increase in bookings of $3.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in Magnetic Solutions gross profit margin from 2018 primarily resulted from the decline in sales, which led to lower absorption of fixed costs within the factories. Higher material costs within this product group were offset by lower labor costs driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Renminbi in 2019 as compared to the exchange rates in place throughout 2018.\nPower Solutions and Protection:\nSales of our Power Solutions products declined by $12.5 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products decreased by $11.2 million, the impact of which was largely seen in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Limitations and additional tariffs related to U.S.-China trade accounted for $6.6 million of the decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, with the balance of the decline relating to lower orders in 2019 as our customers and distribution partners worked through their inventory on hand from 2018. Sales of our circuit protection and custom module products were also lower during 2019 by $1.7 million and $1.5 million from 2018, respectively. These declines were partially offset by revenue from our acquisition of the CUI power assets in December 2019, which contributed $2.2 million of sales during 2019. The reduction in gross profit margin for the Power Solutions and Protection segment primarily related to higher material costs on product shipped during 2019. This was partially offset by lower fixed costs at the factories, with reductions in support labor and fringe of $0.9 million, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million, and a decline in overhead costs of $0.9 million.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the two years ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Material costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Labor costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaterial costs as a percentage of sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components throughout much of 2018, which led to higher raw material prices. The higher-cost raw materials purchased in 2018 were components to a large portion of the finished goods sold throughout 2019. This has had an unfavorable impact on gross margins across most of our product lines.\nLabor costs as a percentage of sales declined in 2019 compared to 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel's factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019.\nThe other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities and insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during 2019 by $5.3 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower support labor and fringe expense of $3.0 million, a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.4 million and lower overhead expenses of $0.5 million.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expenses were $26.9 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduction in R&D expenses during 2019 largely resulted from restructuring efforts during the year, in addition to a favorable impact of the depreciation of the Euro, Pound and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A expenses were $76.1 million in 2019 as compared with $82.6 million in 2018. The reduction primarily related to a lower fringe benefit expense of $2.8 million, a reduction in legal and professional fees of $2.4 million (largely due to elimination of redundant ERP license and support fees), lower sales commissions of $0.7 million and a reduction in G&A headcount resulting in $0.6 million of lower salaries.\nRestructuring Charges\nThe Company recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million in 2019 in connection with the transition of its manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, the closure of its office in Shanghai and indirect headcount reductions in Europe and Asia, largely related to our Power segment. The Company recorded $0.2 million of restructuring charges in 2018 related to the closure of its manufacturing facility in Malaysia.\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred interest expense of $5.4 million in 2019 and $5.3 million in 2018 primarily due to our outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit and security agreement used to fund the 2014 Acquisitions. The slight increase in interest expense during 2019 related to higher interest rates on our outstanding balance during 2019, partially offset by a lower debt balance throughout most of 2019 as compared to 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Debt,\" for further information on the Company's outstanding debt.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net was expense of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to income of $2.0 million in 2018. The expense in 2019 largely related to a $2.1 million loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries. Another factor attributable to the year over year variance was a foreign exchange gain of $2.7 million in 2018 as compared to a foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographic regions. See Note 9, Income Taxes\u201d and the Tax Reform\u201d discussion below.\nTax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, we had made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in which we recognized a provisional amount of $18.1 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. On the basis of revised E&P computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a measurement-period adjustment reducing the deemed repatriation tax by $2.6 million, resulting in the reduction of the Company's provisional estimate from $18.1 million to $15.5 million. The effect of the measurement-period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate was a reduction of approximately 11%. The Company plans to pay the transition tax in installments in accordance with the Act.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected an accounting policy to provide for the tax expense related to the GILTI in the period the tax is incurred. The Company included approximately $6.8 million and $18.0 million of GILTI inclusion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The GILTI income was offset by the Company's U.S. losses and credits which resulted in no additional U.S. tax expense.\n2019 as Compared to 2018\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company's earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $30.9 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in income in the Asia and North America regions. The Company's effective tax rate was (19.7%) and 12.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and permanent tax differences on U.S. tax exempt activities. Additionally, the effective tax rate of 2018 was favorably impacted by a measurement period adjustment of $2.6 million related to the transition tax.\nOther Tax Matters\nThe Company has a portion of its products manufactured on the mainland of the PRC where Bel is not subject to corporate income tax on manufacturing services provided by third parties. Hong Kong has a territorial tax system which imposes corporate income tax at a rate of 16.5% on income from activities solely conducted in Hong Kong.\nThe Company holds an offshore business license from the government of Macao. With this license, a Macao offshore company named Bel Fuse (Macao Commercial Offshore) Limited has been established to handle the Company's sales to third-party customers in Asia. Sales by this company primarily consist of products manufactured in the PRC. This company is not subject to Macao corporate profit taxes which are imposed at a tax rate of 12%. As part of Macau's commitment to comply with OECD standards, it will abolish the existing offshore company (MOC) regime as of January 1, 2021. The existing law and the relevant regulations related to the offshore business will be abolished and the operating permit to carry on offshore business will be terminated on January 1, 2021. The Company has decided to continue this company's operations and beginning January 1, 2021 will pay 12% tax on any profits from this operation.\nManagement has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Applicable income and dividend withholding taxes have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to the practicality of determining the deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries, we have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences and deemed that these basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested.\nInflation and Foreign Currency Exchange\nDuring the past two years, we do not believe the effect of inflation was material to our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected our foreign operations as most sales continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars or currencies directly or indirectly linked to the U.S. dollar. Most significant expenses, including raw materials, labor and manufacturing expenses, are incurred primarily in U.S. dollars or the Chinese Renminbi, and to a lesser extent in British pounds and Mexican pesos. The Chinese Renminbi depreciated by approximately 4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the British pound depreciated by 4%. The Mexican peso did not have a material fluctuation on average in 2019 as compared to 2018. To the extent the Renminbi or Peso appreciate in future periods, it could result in the Company's incurring higher costs for most expenses incurred in the PRC and Mexico. The Company's European entities, whose functional currencies are Euros, British pounds and Czech Korunas, enter into transactions which include sales that are denominated principally in euros, British pounds and various other European currencies, and purchases that are denominated principally in U.S. dollars and British pounds. Such transactions, as well as those related to our multi-currency intercompany payable and receivable transactions, resulted in net realized and unrealized currency exchange (losses) gains of ($0.1) million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were included in other income/expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The currency exchange gains recorded in 2018 were primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and Euro against the U.S. dollar. Translation of subsidiaries' foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in translation adjustments, net of taxes, of $2.6 million and ($6.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, $29.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 40% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company. During 2019, the Company repatriated $29.3 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability. We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company's U.S. operations in the future. In the event these funds were needed for Bel's U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.\nIn June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in December 2014, March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017 (see Note 10, \"Debt,\" for additional details). The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined (\"Leverage Ratio\"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges (\"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\"). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. On February 18, 2020, the Company further amended its credit agreement whereby the Company voluntarily prepaid a portion of its term loan under the Credit Agreement in the amount of $8.2 million. The Amendment also served to modify the interest rate and fees applicable to the loans under the credit agreement and changes certain covenants related to matters including acquisitions, share repurchases and financial ratios.\nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2019, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at December 31, 2019 was $43.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $19.9 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $145.0 million outstanding under its credit agreement. Scheduled principal payments of the long-term debt outstanding are included in \"Contractual Obligations\" below and in Note 10, \"Debt.\"\nFor information regarding further commitments under the Company's operating leases, see Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global Enterprise Resource Planning system ( ERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP is being conducted by business units on a three-phase approach through early 2021. Since inception of the project, we have incurred costs in a cumulative amount of $7.0 million in connection with this implementation, of which $1.8 million and $2.2 million in implementation costs was incurred during 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are included in SG&A on the consolidated financial statements. The first phase of the ERP implementation project was completed in the first quarter of 2019 with the Power Solutions business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2019. The second phase of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2020 with the TRP business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2020. To date, 40% of our overall business has transitioned to the new ERP system and we've achieved annual cost savings on ERP licensing fees of approximately $2 million within SG&A expense which were largely realized in 2019. We anticipate completing this project with in-house resources by early 2021, with no further outside consulting costs. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.4 million. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $24.5 million and $32.0 million of net proceeds from borrowing under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by a $29.0 million payment, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of the CUI power assets, the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $9.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $3.0 million, and payments of $3.4 million for dividends. Cash provided by operations increased by $14.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $15.4 million. This decline was primarily due to the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $11.6 million, repayments of long-term debt of $9.0 million, the acquisition of BCMZ for $2.2 million, and payments of $3.3 million for dividends. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $10.1 million. Cash provided by operations decreased by $14.0 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 31.6% and 32.9% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, accounts receivable decreased $19.3 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased slightly to 60 days at December 31, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories decreased by $17.1 million from the December 31, 2018 level as raw material levels were lower in response to a decrease in customer demand for our products. Inventory turns decreased slightly to 3.6 times per year at December 31, 2019 from 3.7 times per year at December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth at December 31, 2019 the amounts of payments due under specific types of contractual obligations, aggregated by category of contractual obligation, for the time periods described below.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments due on long-term debt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditure obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transition tax payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Raw material purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First quarter 2020 quarterly cash dividend declared\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. (2) Includes interest payments required under our CSA related to our term loans and revolver balance. The interest rate in place under our Credit and Security Agreement on December 31, 2019 was utilized and this calculation assumes obligations are repaid when due. \n (3) Represents estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under non-cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2019. \nAt December 31, 2019, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $29.1 million, most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance of which is included in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2019, we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 9, \"Income Taxes,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company is required to pay SERP obligations at the occurrence of certain events. As of December 31, 2019, $21.5 million is included in long-term liabilities as an unfunded pension obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Included in other assets at December 31, 2019 is the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust with an aggregate value of $14.7 million, which has been designated by the Company to be utilized to fund the Company's SERP obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Other Matters\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as current fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as provisions related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, investments, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including in some cases future projections, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies require accounting estimates that have the potential for significantly impacting Bel's financial statements.\nInventory\nThe Company makes purchasing and manufacturing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers, projected customer requirements and the availability and pricing of raw materials. Future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the Company's operations include miscalculating customer requirements, technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete, loss of customers and/or cancellation of sales orders, stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements. The Company reduces the carrying value of its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on the aforementioned assumptions. When such inventory is subsequently used in the manufacturing process, the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales and the improved gross profit is recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had reserves for excess or obsolete inventory of $9.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.\nA reporting unit is the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at businesses one level below that operating segment, the \"component\" level, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.\nWhile we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, we performed quantitative tests for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated.\nThe goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.\nWe use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non-cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and an appropriate market approach, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit's fair value.\nFair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods.\nIncome Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nThe income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt-free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market-derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit's expected long-term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long-term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt-free working capital.\n2019 Goodwill Impairment Tests\nAs further discussed in Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", due to weakened market conditions, the Company performed interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. Further, based on management's view of the Company, there was a change in reportable operating segments effective October 1, 2019. At the Company's annual test date for goodwill impairment, an analysis was performed on both the one remaining former segment with goodwill and the new segments to ensure that no impairment existed as of the annual test date under either set of segments. Critical assumptions that the Company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units at each test date throughout 2019 included the following:\n \u2022 Applying a compounded annual growth rate for forecasted sales in our projected cash flows through 2024. \nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Segment Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Test Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Normalized Growth Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Applying a terminal value growth rate of 2% for our reporting units to reflect our estimate of stable and perpetual growth. \u2022 Determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to our projected cash flow results. This discount rate reflects, among other things, certain risks due to the uncertainties of achieving the cash flow results and the growth rates assigned. The discount rates applied were as follows: \nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Segment Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Test Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Discount Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interim - 7/31/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Former Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Segments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Annual - 10/1/19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 A weighting of the results of the income approach of 75% of our overall fair value calculation for each reporting unit. \nChanges in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts take into account the near and long-term expected business performance, considering the long-term market conditions and business trends within the reporting units. For further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see \"Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nMarket Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nEach year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value.\nThe market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit's operating performance (the \"Public Company Method\"). These multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company (the \"Quoted Price Method\"). The third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publicly-traded and privately-held companies in our industries (the \"Mergers and Acquisition Method\").\nThe key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12-month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under the Public Company and Quoted Price Methods, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions.\nWe applied a combined weighting of 25% to the market approach when determining the fair value of these reporting units.\nIf our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock, a decline in current market multiples, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, heightened competition, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of), we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at that time. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its goodwill exceeded the associated carrying value at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment exists as of that date. See Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2019.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy or significant declines in our stock price, indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company annually tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on October 1, using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). The Company conducted an interim impairment test as of July 31, 2019 and subsequently, its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at either testing date. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its trademarks exceeds the associated carrying values at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment existed as of that date. At December 31, 2019, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets related solely to trademarks.\nLong-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company depreciates its property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Management reviews long-lived assets and other intangible assets for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related net book value. No material impairments related to long-lived assets or amortized intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such asset. In the ordinary course of a global business, the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain for many transactions. It is the Company's policy not to recognize tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions that may not be realized in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes the provisions based upon management's assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically (at least quarterly) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. The accounting literature requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and, consequently, affect our operating results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standards further described in Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that more closely aligns revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Management believes that the loss of this individual customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had sales of $50.2 million to Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group, representing 10.2% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Sales to this customer are primarily in the Company's Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nOther Matters\nThe Company believes that it has sufficient cash reserves to fund its foreseeable working capital needs. It may, however, seek to expand such resources through bank borrowings, at favorable lending rates, from time to time. If the Company were to undertake another substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or would be financed in part through cash on hand and in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. If the Company borrows additional money to finance acquisitions, this would further decrease the Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, and could further impact the Company's material restrictive covenants, depending on the size of the borrowing and the nature of the target company. Under its existing credit facility, the Company is required to obtain its lender's consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and may be restricted from paying cash dividends on its common stock. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the Company cannot assure investors that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If the Company issues a substantial amount of stock either as consideration in an acquisition or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over its existing common stock.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe information in this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results, causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" above for further information. Also, when we cross reference to a \"Note,\" we are referring to our \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\" unless the context indicates otherwise. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.\nUnder the SEC's amended definition of a \"smaller reporting company,\" the Company is deemed to be a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, among other things, the Company is not required to present selected financial data in Item 6 and has reduced the number of years covered by its financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.\nWe operate through three product group segments, in addition to a Corporate segment. In 2019, 35% of the Company's revenues were derived from Cinch Connectivity Solutions, 33% from Power Solutions and Protection and 32% from its Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nOur operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.\nWe have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.\nKey Factors Affecting our Business\nThe Company believes the key factors affecting Bel's 2019 and/or future results include the following:\n \u2022 Revenues - The Company's revenues declined by $55.8 million, or 10.2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. By product segment, Power Solutions and Protection sales were down by 7.3%, Cinch Connectivity Solutions sales declined by 7.7% and Magnetic Solutions sales were lower by 15.4%. International trade policy, and in particular the additional tariffs imposed on our products imported from China, negatively impacted our sales volumes in 2019. Following an acceleration of orders throughout 2018 from customers anticipating higher pricing in 2019, the industry experienced lower order and sales volumes throughout the supply chain in 2019. In many cases for Bel, the lower order volume related to customers and distributors working through their inventory on hand. However, by year end, the ongoing tariffs caused certain customers to source products from other countries and this further impacted our sales beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \u2022 Backlog - Our backlog of orders totaled $160.2 million at December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $10.9 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2018. Since the 2018 year-end, we saw a 21% increase at Cinch Connectivity Solutions, driven by higher demand related to a variety of military applications. The backlog for our Power Solutions and Protection products decreased by 14%, driven by certain customers sourcing product elsewhere in light of the ongoing tariffs on our product manufactured in China. Further, several of our OEM customers and distribution partners continued to work through inventory on hand through the remainder of 2019, and did not yet place replenishment orders prior to year-end. Our Magnetic Solutions backlog declined by 29%, as one of our large OEM end customers had ordered high volumes at the start of a new product launch in 2018 and worked through inventory on hand throughout 2019. \n \u2022 Product Mix - Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company's gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel's profit margins. See Note 12, \"Segments\" for profit margin information by product group. \n \u2022 Pricing and Availability of Materials - There have been recent supply constraints related to components that constitute raw materials in our manufacturing processes, particularly with resistors, capacitors, mosfets and printed circuit boards. Lead times were extended and the reduction in supply also caused an increase in prices for certain of these components throughout 2018. As a result, the Company's material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 44.7% during 2019 from 41.9% during 2018. Purchases of raw materials during 2019 were at lower pricing though still elevated compared to pre-2018 pricing. As we've worked through much of our higher cost inventory on hand from 2018, we anticipate our material costs as a percentage of sales will be lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Labor Costs - Labor costs decreased from 11.5% of sales during 2018 to 10.3% of sales during 2019, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Renminbi, particularly during the first half of 2019. The favorable impact of exchange rates was partially offset by minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. We anticipate labor costs will be a challenge in the early part of 2020 as we expect to incur labor costs in the PRC for associates who are unable to return to work following the extended Lunar New Year holiday due to travel restrictions or illness in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. The preceding two sentences represent a Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Restructuring - The Company continues to implement restructuring programs to increase operational efficiencies and incurred $2.6 million in restructuring costs during 2019. Throughout 2019, we transitioned our Signal manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, closed our office in Shanghai, and implemented other indirect headcount reductions globally. These actions resulted in total annualized cost savings of $5.7 million ($3.4 million in cost of sales, $1.8 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). Of the annualized cost savings, $1.7 million was realized in 2019 with the incremental $4.0 million to be realized in 2020 ($2.6 million in cost of sales, $0.9 million in R&D and $0.5 million in SG&A). The Company will continue to streamline the organization in 2020 to further improve profitability. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Impact of Foreign Currency - During 2019, favorable fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi, resulted in lower labor and overhead costs of $4.2 million versus the exchange rates in effect during 2018. In addition, a foreign exchange transactional gain of $0.1 million was realized during 2019. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany as well as third-party transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The Company has significant manufacturing operations located in the PRC where labor and overhead costs are paid in local currency. As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $4.2 million lower in 2019. The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and may implement pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its consolidated operating results. \n \u2022 ERP System Implementation - In January 2019, the Company completed the first phase of its ERP system implementation with the successful transition of its Power Solutions business onto the new system without any notable issues. In January 2020, the second phase of the implementation related to its TRP business was completed successfully. The Company incurred expenses of $1.8 million during 2019 related to this project. The remaining phases of this project will largely leverage Bel's trained internal resources which should result in lower implementation costs going forward. In 2019, the Company realized cost savings of $2.0 million related to the elimination of redundant license fees associated with its ERP systems. \n \u2022 Coronavirus Outbreak - Bel is closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its impact on our operations and supply channel. We anticipate first quarter 2020 results will be impacted by the extended Lunar New Year holiday break and by lower productivity levels at our four manufacturing sites in China, all of which have resumed operations at reduced levels. Our top priority is the welfare of our associates, and we are working diligently with the local governmental authorities to ensure necessary preparations are made to allow our remaining associates to safely return to work. Lead times for our products are currently pushed back by four weeks, and may extend further as we better determine the impact on our suppliers. Logistics companies and customs offices are also operating at reduced levels. As of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the level of financial impact that the Coronavirus will have on our 2020 consolidated financial results. \n \u2022 Regulatory Approvals - Bel's Cinch Connectivity Solutions segment is a supplier to a large U.S. commercial aerospace customer and has content on a model of aircraft that is currently grounded. We anticipate, at a minimum, sales to be unfavorably impacted by $5-$7 million throughout the first half of 2020, with an earnings impact of approximately $2.5-$3.0 million. This impact is an estimate for the first half of 2020 only, and we anticipate a similar impact in future quarters for as long as the grounding continues. The preceding two sentences represent Forward-Looking Statements. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" \n \u2022 Effective Tax Rate - The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic region in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographic regions. See Note 9 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Income Taxes\". \nWe enter 2020 with very limited visibility given the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in China and separately, the grounding of aircraft at a large commercial aerospace customer. Bel management is closely monitoring both of these situations, and working diligently to minimize the impacts to our operations and financial results.\nSummary by Operating Segment\nNet Sales\nThe Company's net sales by major product line for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nCinch Connectivity Solutions:\nOur connectivity solutions products showed a reduction in sales of $14.4 million during 2019 compared to 2018. Sales of our Stewart passive connectors were down by $8.4 million from 2018 primarily due to reduced volume of product flowing through out distribution channels as our distribution partners continued to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. In addition, weakened economic conditions in the construction industry in the U.S. and Europe impacted demand for our product in premise wiring applications. Sales of our Cinch products were lower by $5.9 million in 2019 primarily related to lower demand from military and commercial aerospace customers compared to 2018. The decline in Cinch Connectivity Solutions gross profit margins during 2019 related to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower sales and higher direct and indirect labor costs, particularly in Mexico where the minimum wage rates increased significantly effective January 1, 2019.\nMagnetic Solutions:\nSales of our magnetic products declined by $28.9 million from 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 were worked through. While orders received for our magnetic products in 2019 were down by $53.0 million from 2018 levels, we saw our first indication of recovery in the fourth quarter of 2019, with an increase in bookings of $3.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in Magnetic Solutions gross profit margin from 2018 primarily resulted from the decline in sales, which led to lower absorption of fixed costs within the factories. Higher material costs within this product group were offset by lower labor costs driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Renminbi in 2019 as compared to the exchange rates in place throughout 2018.\nPower Solutions and Protection:\nSales of our Power Solutions products declined by $12.5 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products decreased by $11.2 million, the impact of which was largely seen in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Limitations and additional tariffs related to U.S.-China trade accounted for $6.6 million of the decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, with the balance of the decline relating to lower orders in 2019 as our customers and distribution partners worked through their inventory on hand from 2018. Sales of our circuit protection and custom module products were also lower during 2019 by $1.7 million and $1.5 million from 2018, respectively. These declines were partially offset by revenue from our acquisition of the CUI power assets in December 2019, which contributed $2.2 million of sales during 2019. The reduction in gross profit margin for the Power Solutions and Protection segment primarily related to higher material costs on product shipped during 2019. This was partially offset by lower fixed costs at the factories, with reductions in support labor and fringe of $0.9 million, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million, and a decline in overhead costs of $0.9 million.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the two years ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\n\nMaterial costs as a percentage of sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components throughout much of 2018, which led to higher raw material prices. The higher-cost raw materials purchased in 2018 were components to a large portion of the finished goods sold throughout 2019. This has had an unfavorable impact on gross margins across most of our product lines.\nLabor costs as a percentage of sales declined in 2019 compared to 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel's factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019.\nThe other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities and insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during 2019 by $5.3 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower support labor and fringe expense of $3.0 million, a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.4 million and lower overhead expenses of $0.5 million.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expenses were $26.9 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduction in R&D expenses during 2019 largely resulted from restructuring efforts during the year, in addition to a favorable impact of the depreciation of the Euro, Pound and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A expenses were $76.1 million in 2019 as compared with $82.6 million in 2018. The reduction primarily related to a lower fringe benefit expense of $2.8 million, a reduction in legal and professional fees of $2.4 million (largely due to elimination of redundant ERP license and support fees), lower sales commissions of $0.7 million and a reduction in G&A headcount resulting in $0.6 million of lower salaries.\nRestructuring Charges\nThe Company recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million in 2019 in connection with the transition of its manufacturing operations from Inwood, New York to other existing Bel facilities, the closure of its office in Shanghai and indirect headcount reductions in Europe and Asia, largely related to our Power segment. The Company recorded $0.2 million of restructuring charges in 2018 related to the closure of its manufacturing facility in Malaysia.\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred interest expense of $5.4 million in 2019 and $5.3 million in 2018 primarily due to our outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit and security agreement used to fund the 2014 Acquisitions. The slight increase in interest expense during 2019 related to higher interest rates on our outstanding balance during 2019, partially offset by a lower debt balance throughout most of 2019 as compared to 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements - \"Debt,\" for further information on the Company's outstanding debt.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net was expense of $2.3 million in 2019 compared to income of $2.0 million in 2018. The expense in 2019 largely related to a $2.1 million loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries. Another factor attributable to the year over year variance was a foreign exchange gain of $2.7 million in 2018 as compared to a foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe's tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographic regions. See Note 9, Income Taxes\u201d and the Tax Reform\u201d discussion below.\nTax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, we had made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in which we recognized a provisional amount of $18.1 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. On the basis of revised E&P computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a measurement-period adjustment reducing the deemed repatriation tax by $2.6 million, resulting in the reduction of the Company's provisional estimate from $18.1 million to $15.5 million. The effect of the measurement-period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate was a reduction of approximately 11%. The Company plans to pay the transition tax in installments in accordance with the Act.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected an accounting policy to provide for the tax expense related to the GILTI in the period the tax is incurred. The Company included approximately $6.8 million and $18.0 million of GILTI inclusion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The GILTI income was offset by the Company's U.S. losses and credits which resulted in no additional U.S. tax expense.\n2019 as Compared to 2018\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company's earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $30.9 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in income in the Asia and North America regions. The Company's effective tax rate was (19.7%) and 12.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and permanent tax differences on U.S. tax exempt activities. Additionally, the effective tax rate of 2018 was favorably impacted by a measurement period adjustment of $2.6 million related to the transition tax.\nOther Tax Matters\nThe Company has a portion of its products manufactured on the mainland of the PRC where Bel is not subject to corporate income tax on manufacturing services provided by third parties. Hong Kong has a territorial tax system which imposes corporate income tax at a rate of 16.5% on income from activities solely conducted in Hong Kong.\nThe Company holds an offshore business license from the government of Macao. With this license, a Macao offshore company named Bel Fuse (Macao Commercial Offshore) Limited has been established to handle the Company's sales to third-party customers in Asia. Sales by this company primarily consist of products manufactured in the PRC. This company is not subject to Macao corporate profit taxes which are imposed at a tax rate of 12%. As part of Macau's commitment to comply with OECD standards, it will abolish the existing offshore company (MOC) regime as of January 1, 2021. The existing law and the relevant regulations related to the offshore business will be abolished and the operating permit to carry on offshore business will be terminated on January 1, 2021. The Company has decided to continue this company's operations and beginning January 1, 2021 will pay 12% tax on any profits from this operation.\nManagement has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Applicable income and dividend withholding taxes have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to the practicality of determining the deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries, we have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences and deemed that these basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested.\nInflation and Foreign Currency Exchange\nDuring the past two years, we do not believe the effect of inflation was material to our consolidated financial position or our consolidated results of operations. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected our foreign operations as most sales continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars or currencies directly or indirectly linked to the U.S. dollar. Most significant expenses, including raw materials, labor and manufacturing expenses, are incurred primarily in U.S. dollars or the Chinese Renminbi, and to a lesser extent in British pounds and Mexican pesos. The Chinese Renminbi depreciated by approximately 4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the British pound depreciated by 4%. The Mexican peso did not have a material fluctuation on average in 2019 as compared to 2018. To the extent the Renminbi or Peso appreciate in future periods, it could result in the Company's incurring higher costs for most expenses incurred in the PRC and Mexico. The Company's European entities, whose functional currencies are Euros, British pounds and Czech Korunas, enter into transactions which include sales that are denominated principally in euros, British pounds and various other European currencies, and purchases that are denominated principally in U.S. dollars and British pounds. Such transactions, as well as those related to our multi-currency intercompany payable and receivable transactions, resulted in net realized and unrealized currency exchange (losses) gains of ($0.1) million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were included in other income/expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The currency exchange gains recorded in 2018 were primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and Euro against the U.S. dollar. Translation of subsidiaries' foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in translation adjustments, net of taxes, of $2.6 million and ($6.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, $29.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 40% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company. During 2019, the Company repatriated $29.3 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability. We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company's U.S. operations in the future. In the event these funds were needed for Bel's U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds.\nIn June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in December 2014, March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017 (see Note 10, \"Debt,\" for additional details). The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined (\"Leverage Ratio\"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges (\"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\"). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. On February 18, 2020, the Company further amended its credit agreement whereby the Company voluntarily prepaid a portion of its term loan under the Credit Agreement in the amount of $8.2 million. The Amendment also served to modify the interest rate and fees applicable to the loans under the credit agreement and changes certain covenants related to matters including acquisitions, share repurchases and financial ratios.\nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2019, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at December 31, 2019 was $43.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $19.9 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $145.0 million outstanding under its credit agreement. Scheduled principal payments of the long-term debt outstanding are included in \"Contractual Obligations\" below and in Note 10, \"Debt.\"\nFor information regarding further commitments under the Company's operating leases, see Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global Enterprise Resource Planning system ( ERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP is being conducted by business units on a three-phase approach through early 2021. Since inception of the project, we have incurred costs in a cumulative amount of $7.0 million in connection with this implementation, of which $1.8 million and $2.2 million in implementation costs was incurred during 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are included in SG&A on the consolidated financial statements. The first phase of the ERP implementation project was completed in the first quarter of 2019 with the Power Solutions business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2019. The second phase of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2020 with the TRP business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2020. To date, 40% of our overall business has transitioned to the new ERP system and we've achieved annual cost savings on ERP licensing fees of approximately $2 million within SG&A expense which were largely realized in 2019. We anticipate completing this project with in-house resources by early 2021, with no further outside consulting costs. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See \"Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.4 million. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations of $24.5 million and $32.0 million of net proceeds from borrowing under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by a $29.0 million payment, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of the CUI power assets, the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $9.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $3.0 million, and payments of $3.4 million for dividends. Cash provided by operations increased by $14.4 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $15.4 million. This decline was primarily due to the purchase of property, plant and equipment of $11.6 million, repayments of long-term debt of $9.0 million, the acquisition of BCMZ for $2.2 million, and payments of $3.3 million for dividends. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $10.1 million. Cash provided by operations decreased by $14.0 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher year-end inventory levels and accounts receivable balances in 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 31.6% and 32.9% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, accounts receivable decreased $19.3 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased slightly to 60 days at December 31, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories decreased by $17.1 million from the December 31, 2018 level as raw material levels were lower in response to a decrease in customer demand for our products. Inventory turns decreased slightly to 3.6 times per year at December 31, 2019 from 3.7 times per year at December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth at December 31, 2019 the amounts of payments due under specific types of contractual obligations, aggregated by category of contractual obligation, for the time periods described below.\n\n (1) Represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period. (2) Includes interest payments required under our CSA related to our term loans and revolver balance. The interest rate in place under our Credit and Security Agreement on December 31, 2019 was utilized and this calculation assumes obligations are repaid when due. \n (3) Represents estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under non-cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2019. \nAt December 31, 2019, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $29.1 million, most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance of which is included in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2019, we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities. See Note 9, \"Income Taxes,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company is required to pay SERP obligations at the occurrence of certain events. As of December 31, 2019, $21.5 million is included in long-term liabilities as an unfunded pension obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Included in other assets at December 31, 2019 is the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust with an aggregate value of $14.7 million, which has been designated by the Company to be utilized to fund the Company's SERP obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Other Matters\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as current fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as provisions related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, investments, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, including in some cases future projections, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies require accounting estimates that have the potential for significantly impacting Bel's financial statements.\nInventory\nThe Company makes purchasing and manufacturing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers, projected customer requirements and the availability and pricing of raw materials. Future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the Company's operations include miscalculating customer requirements, technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete, loss of customers and/or cancellation of sales orders, stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements. The Company reduces the carrying value of its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on the aforementioned assumptions. When such inventory is subsequently used in the manufacturing process, the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales and the improved gross profit is recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had reserves for excess or obsolete inventory of $9.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.\nA reporting unit is the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at businesses one level below that operating segment, the \"component\" level, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.\nWhile we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, we performed quantitative tests for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated.\nThe goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.\nWe use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non-cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and an appropriate market approach, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit's fair value.\nFair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods.\nIncome Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nThe income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt-free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market-derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit's expected long-term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long-term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt-free working capital.\n2019 Goodwill Impairment Tests\nAs further discussed in Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", due to weakened market conditions, the Company performed interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. Further, based on management's view of the Company, there was a change in reportable operating segments effective October 1, 2019. At the Company's annual test date for goodwill impairment, an analysis was performed on both the one remaining former segment with goodwill and the new segments to ensure that no impairment existed as of the annual test date under either set of segments. Critical assumptions that the Company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units at each test date throughout 2019 included the following:\n \u2022 Applying a compounded annual growth rate for forecasted sales in our projected cash flows through 2024. \n\n \u2022 Applying a terminal value growth rate of 2% for our reporting units to reflect our estimate of stable and perpetual growth. \u2022 Determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to our projected cash flow results. This discount rate reflects, among other things, certain risks due to the uncertainties of achieving the cash flow results and the growth rates assigned. The discount rates applied were as follows: \n\n \u2022 A weighting of the results of the income approach of 75% of our overall fair value calculation for each reporting unit. \nChanges in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Our forecasts take into account the near and long-term expected business performance, considering the long-term market conditions and business trends within the reporting units. For further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions, see \"Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nMarket Approach Used to Determine Fair Values\nEach year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value.\nThe market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit's operating performance (the \"Public Company Method\"). These multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company (the \"Quoted Price Method\"). The third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publicly-traded and privately-held companies in our industries (the \"Mergers and Acquisition Method\").\nThe key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12-month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under the Public Company and Quoted Price Methods, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions.\nWe applied a combined weighting of 25% to the market approach when determining the fair value of these reporting units.\nIf our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock, a decline in current market multiples, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, heightened competition, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of), we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at that time. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its goodwill exceeded the associated carrying value at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment exists as of that date. See Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2019.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy or significant declines in our stock price, indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company annually tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on October 1, using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). The Company conducted an interim impairment test as of July 31, 2019 and subsequently, its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019, and no impairment was identified at either testing date. Management has also concluded that the fair value of its trademarks exceeds the associated carrying values at December 31, 2019 and that no impairment existed as of that date. At December 31, 2019, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets related solely to trademarks.\nLong-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company depreciates its property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Management reviews long-lived assets and other intangible assets for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related net book value. No material impairments related to long-lived assets or amortized intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such asset. In the ordinary course of a global business, the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain for many transactions. It is the Company's policy not to recognize tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions that may not be realized in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes the provisions based upon management's assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically (at least quarterly) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. The accounting literature requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and, consequently, affect our operating results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standards further described in Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that more closely aligns revenue recognition with the transfer of control of the Company's goods and services and provides financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Management believes that the loss of this individual customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had sales of $50.2 million to Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group, representing 10.2% of Bel's consolidated revenue. Sales to this customer are primarily in the Company's Magnetic Solutions operating segment.\nCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nOther Matters\nThe Company believes that it has sufficient cash reserves to fund its foreseeable working capital needs. It may, however, seek to expand such resources through bank borrowings, at favorable lending rates, from time to time. If the Company were to undertake another substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or would be financed in part through cash on hand and in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. If the Company borrows additional money to finance acquisitions, this would further decrease the Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, and could further impact the Company's material restrictive covenants, depending on the size of the borrowing and the nature of the target company. Under its existing credit facility, the Company is required to obtain its lender's consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and may be restricted from paying cash dividends on its common stock. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the Company cannot assure investors that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If the Company issues a substantial amount of stock either as consideration in an acquisition or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over its existing common stock.\nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nThe discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) highlights the importance of reading it alongside the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. It warns that the trends and causes of results discussed should not be presumed to continue into the future due to the forward-looking nature of the statements.\n\nThe Company, which is now classified as a \"smaller reporting company,\" is engaged in designing, manufacturing, and marketing products that are used in various industries, predominantly in networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation, and broadcasting. Revenue for 2019 is distributed fairly evenly among the Company's three product segments, and its operating expenses are primarily influenced by labor and material costs which can shift with product mix changes.\n\nSome of the key dynamics affecting the Company in 2019 include:\n\n- A decrease in revenues of 10.2%, due to reductions in sales across all product segments, affected particularly by tariffs imposed on products imported from China, an inventory surplus among customers, and shifts in customer sourcing strategies due to tariffs.\n- A decrease of 6% in order backlogs from the previous year-end.\n- Product mix shifts that affect gross margins, with connectivity products contributing the highest margins while magnetic products are less profitable due to labor intensity, and power products have lower margins due to high material content.\n- Increases in material costs as percentage of sales due to supply constraints and price increases for certain components.\n- A decrease in labor costs as a percentage of sales, partially due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, though labor costs are expected to remain a challenge due to the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak.\n- Efforts in restructuring to increase operational efficiencies led to restructuring costs totaling $2.6 million for the year.\n- Foreign currency fluctuations, mainly between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi, which positively affected labor and overhead costs.\n- ERP system implementation costs of $1.8 million for the year, with anticipated cost savings from reduced license fees moving forward.\n- Potential impact on first quarter 2020 results due to the coronavirus outbreak with reduced operations at Chinese manufacturing sites.\n- Commercial aerospace segment facing an unfavorable sales impact of $5-$7 million in the first half of 2020 due to aircraft grounding.\n\nThe Company expects that the coronavirus outbreak and the grounding of a key aircraft model are expected to impact the 2020 outlook, with limited visibility into future conditions.\n\nThe report emphasizes that the Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate depending on the geographic region of pretax profits, with Asia having the lowest tax rates, and the U.S. and Europe generally equivalent.\n\nNet sales and gross profit percentages by product line for 2019 and 2018 are detailed, revealing declines across all major product lines and a decrease in gross profit percentages for the year.\n\nFinally, the discussion includes in-depth considerations on critical accounting policies such as revenue recognition, inventory estimates, impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, income taxes, and litigation regulations. The report also touches on liquidity, capital resources, and the impacts of adopting new financial accounting standards."}
